title:           "Content Warnings"
summary:         "Added new page for CW, working on season 3 transcripts"
---

Changelog:

* Added new page to list all the Content Warnings for each episode on one page.

* In the process of turning the official season 3 transcripts into Markdown format to post on the website. Some copyediting liberties will be taken.

* Only the Google Doc formats for the season 3 transcripts will be official (unless Rusty Quill produces more formats). All other formats will be from editing made by StellarScripts.
