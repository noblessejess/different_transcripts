##### [show theme]

#### IMOGEN

Rusty Quill presents: Stellar Firma.

##### [theme continues]

#### DAVID 

_(talking to themself)_ Maybe he's *never* going to be on time. Maybe it's just 20 minutes *forever*. __[pause]__ If I could replace him with an IMOGEN robot that *looked* like Trexel... yes... __[footsteps approach]__ Maybe I'll just search on IMOGEN...

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ IMOGEN online.

##### [door swooshes open]

#### TREXEL

David! __[David yelps]__ What are you doing on IMOGEN?

#### DAVID

What?! No! Nothing!

#### TREXEL

By which I mean, _(cordial)_ good afternoon, David. How are you?

#### DAVID 

_(hesitantly)_ Hello. Uh, yes, I'm good.

#### TREXEL

Swift-fingered David, tapping away quietly in the darkness. Let's just pop the light on there...

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ Access granted.

##### [bwoop of lights turning on]

#### TREXEL

There it is. Tapping away into darkness there.

#### DAVID

So... Yes, no, I'm just, you know... So did you get invited... to the party? Did we-- did we get invited to--

#### TREXEL

What party? What are you talking about?

#### DAVID

--the party? You know, um... Bromius' party? Psilax?

#### TREXEL

Who the hell is Bromius?

#### DAVID

We-- The client yesterday?

#### TREXEL

Oh, that! No, I didn't even begin to follow that up, David. I said that because you seemed sad, [__DAVID: [disappointed]__ Oh.] and then I left, and then I was like, "Oh, he's not my boss!" And that's pretty much the extent of my thought. Oh-- have I been invited to a party? As we mentioned, I've never been invited to a party, and that's never stopped me. So if it's stopping *you*, David, whose fault is that? Is it-- is it mine? No!

#### DAVID 

_(mumbled)_ It's the room's.

#### TREXEL

It's-- it's *yours*, is what I was saying. [__DAVID:__ Oh.] Though, you're not allowed to leave the room, that is, to a certain extent, the-- the confines of the room. But mainly, it's you and your lack of imagination.

#### DAVID 

_(hopeful)_ We could have a party in here!

#### TREXEL 

_(disparaging)_ And what would *that* look like, David? What, you and me?

#### DAVID

Well, no, and some other people...

#### TREXEL

Hartro, maybe?

#### DAVID

Yes, and IMOGEN...

#### TREXEL

IMOGEN's *everywhere*.

#### DAVID

Well, good. Then she will be on time.

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ Party invite logged.

#### DAVID

And early! And late.

#### TREXEL

And-- and late. And just-- just, all.

#### DAVID

Yes, but you know--

#### TREXEL

IMOGEN eternal.

#### DAVID

Yes, so that's good, and... that is the sum total of people I know! We could invite the Board! I know the Board.

#### TREXEL

You would--

#### DAVID

Or the Build Team!

#### TREXEL 

_(threatening)_ You know-- you'd like to invite *the Board?*

#### DAVID

Yes!

#### IMOGEN 

__[error buzz]__ *You do not contact The Board*.

#### TREXEL

Do-- do you have any idea what would happen if you sent a message upstairs to the Board?

#### DAVID

I don't know how to do that.

#### TREXEL

You would just disappear, David. [__DAVID:__ What?] I wouldn't even know. I would come here-- I would come in one morning... Afternoon...Mid-to-late evening. I'd come in, and there would just be a *burn* on the floor. And there would be a little note saying, "Guess who tried to contact the Board? This idiot."

#### DAVID

Well, that sounds a lot like you. Did you write the note?

#### TREXEL

The Board contacts *you*. [__DAVID:__ Okay.] You do *not* contact the Board.

#### DAVID

Okay, well...

#### TREXEL

*IMOGEN* might contact the Board. But you know why? IMOGEN's an all-powerful robot.

#### DAVID

Okay, so... Well, if-- if the Board ever *want* to be invited to a party in this room, I would be happy... to have them.

#### TREXEL

Now, David, an open invitation is *sort of* like contacting the Board.

#### DAVID

No, it's not-- No, no, no, no, no, no no no no--

#### TREXEL

You're on dodgy ground there, David!

#### DAVID

I just said something into the air...

#### TREXEL

You're on a-- you're a shifting plate.

#### DAVID

No. No. N--

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ Thin ice. Watch it, buster!

#### DAVID 

_(squeakily)_ Anyway! Anyway. There's a-- we've got another brief, obviously, [__TREXEL:__ Oh, shock!] because that's our work, and our jobs, and-- which we're all very-- __[sighs]__ We have... _(muttered)_ 20 minutes for this one again.

#### TREXEL

Oh, again, shock!

#### DAVID

Anyway.

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ Initiating.

#### DAVID

Yes, shock, because we should be on time, because of...

#### TREXEL

Oh, *should* we?

#### DAVID

Yes. The things we've been talking about...

#### TREXEL

Has it hurt-- has it hurt the briefs so far?

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

I-- I don't think so.

#### DAVID

Well, I--

#### TREXEL

I disagree.

#### DAVID

Well, we'll see--

#### TREXEL

Who's in charge?

#### DAVID

We'll see--

#### TREXEL

Is it you?

#### DAVID

Hartro.

#### TREXEL

Ahhh, you've got me there...

#### DAVID

And we shall see in the *review* [__TREXEL:__ Yes, we shall!] what she thinks.

#### TREXEL

We *shall* see!

#### DAVID

Yes, we *shall!*

#### TREXEL

Yes, we shall!

#### DAVID

Yes! Yes, we *shall* see!

#### TREXEL

Shalt-- *shaltn't* we?

#### DAVID

Yes, you *shaltn't!*

#### TREXEL

An-- oh, look at this beach! It's full of *shalls!*

#### DAVID 

_(angrily)_ Yes! Yes! Well--

#### TREXEL

Let us frolic!

#### DAVID

Yes! We shall frolic! 'Cause *you* shall--

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ Sass levels critical. Security alerted.

#### DAVID

--*with* shalls that Hartro's *shalling* onto you!

#### TREXEL

You're coming apart at your corners, David. Read the brief.

#### DAVID

Look, anyway, it's from Lorek Brynison! King of the Armoured Polar Bears of Svalbard. There are a lot of words in there that I don't understand, but... why do they want the planet built? They say that "you humans"--that's *you*, 'cause I'm a clone, which I don't... _(reading)_ "you"--

#### TREXEL

It's-- it's sort of a human?

#### DAVID

No, well-- "you"--

#### TREXEL

It's a facsimile.

#### DAVID 

_(reading)_ "You humans-- [__TREXEL:__ Yes, we.] you humans have messed up this planet for too long," [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] _(under their breath)_ *Don't know which* _(normal)_ "and now all my lovely Arctic glaciers are melting. [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] So I'm going elsewhere to somewhere nice and cold, preferably a whole planet covered in snow and ice. [__TREXEL:__ Okay.] So long, and thanks for all the seals." [__TREXEL:__ Okay.] Well, that's nice. And they must have "other cold-weather creatures for me to feast on, [__TREXEL:__ Hmm.] the cuter the better".

#### TREXEL

Ok, so, we-- we-- we want your basic ice planet here. You want-- This is not a complicated job, David, *you would think*.

#### DAVID

Which planet did you ruin?

#### TREXEL

Exactly, that's what I was getting to. This is a little bit of a party foul on humanity's part because--

#### DAVID

Oh, uh, like going to a party uninvited? Is that a party foul?

#### TREXEL

I wouldn't know. It's like a chicken in a party, it's a party fowl. So you wouldn't-- you shouldn't bring a chicken. You shouldn't bring a chicken. No one wants it there. "Oh, look it's-- it's done its business on the floor!"

#### DAVID

So... bringing a fowl to a party is a party foul?

#### TREXEL

Look, I'm not trying to make a joke out of this, David.

#### DAVID

I'm sorry, no, this is very serious.

#### TREXEL

I've actually brought some chickens to a party, and everyone was *furious*. But what I'm trying to say... is that we have a bit of a history with--

#### DAVID

*You* have a bit of history...

#### TREXEL 

_(angry)_ Wh-- the-- the *Board* "we"! Everybody has a history with the polar bears and, indeed, their various home planets. Now, I don't know if you remember, David... Earth is gone. Earth has been gone for a very long time.

#### DAVID

Yes, I'm aware.

#### TREXEL

And on that planet, there were polar bears. [__DAVID:__ Okay. Is--] And no one was more shocked than humanity when we left to find out the polar bears had left *years* before! They had worked it out and-- and left, on ships. We don't know where they built them, David. [__DAVID:__ Right.] Just one day, a mountain opened up, a spaceship shot out, we were all like, "What was that?!" Later, turns out all the polar bears were on that. They were *really* on top of that whole, you know, planet thing we ruined. 

And as we all, you know, found a new life, amongst the stars... [__DAVID:__ Mm.] we, you know, caught up with them and we may... have used the planet they were on to dump our rubbish, thus also ruining that planet. And then they moved again, and then we found them, and then... so it started to feel a bit vindictive after a while. 

I think we were-- we-- we-- [__DAVID:__ Right.] I think we were a little bit salty about the fact that they had worked out, you know, that level of space travel years before and just left without us. Sure, *we* were the reason they were having to leave, and why would you bring that guy along, but still, it hurts! 

So... you know, obviously, that was a while ago, but as you can see from the brief there, we still do occasionally-- you know, because of a-- oh, one of our-- one of our stars exploded, or-- or because, you know, there was a radiation leak from a-- from a power unit we were using to-- to-- to make a moon go around, or something like that. It *will* ruin their planet. And as you can see there, we've melted that one, they need a new one and unfortunately, who's the only terraforming game in town? Stellar Firma Ltd. [__DAVID:__ Okay.] So they've had to... they've had to come back. So--

#### DAVID

Oh, that's humiliating.

#### TREXEL

It's-- it's-- it's pretty humiliating for them, and that's why they're very cross with us, but they're also vastly rich. Because, you know, who's gonna give a bad deal to a polar bear? __[stammers]__ What, are you gonna-- you're gonna shirk the polar bear on a deal? Cut a few percent-- it'll maul your face!

#### DAVID

I'm just going to... __[typing]__ polar...

#### TREXEL

Just look one up!

#### DAVID

...bear...

#### TREXEL

Look one up!

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ Polar bear fact file: images.

#### DAVID

Oh, that looks lovely!

#### TREXEL

Yeah-- they look lovely, but they take your face right off.

#### DAVID 

__[typing]__ Polar bear... during a business meeting...

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__

#### DAVID

*Ooh!*

#### TREXEL

Yeah.

#### DAVID

Ooh! Ooh.

#### TREXEL

That's a-- that's a good suit.

#### DAVID

Ooh... that is a powerful stance!

#### TREXEL

That's a powerful stance. Wide, wide stance.

#### DAVID 

_(awed)_ Goodness me...

#### TREXEL

You can see *everything*, David.

#### DAVID

Yes!

#### TREXEL

You're not gonna mess with that bear.

#### DAVID

No!

#### TREXEL

Exactly.

#### DAVID

Right...

#### TREXEL

And that's the kind of person we're dealing with here.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

I say person, being...

#### DAVID

Bear.

#### TREXEL

Bear. It's kind of bear we're dealing with.

#### DAVID

Okay. Right, a powerful... powerful...

#### TREXEL

So what I'm saying, David--

#### DAVID

Well, *naked*...

#### TREXEL

What?

#### DAVID

--Armored. But naked. But naked? But not below the--

#### TREXEL 

_(crosstalk)_ Well, no, they-- they have, like, a suit on, but because they're a bear, there's just-- there's no-- there's no bottom to it.

#### DAVID

...Sure. So it's a-- sort of a bear in a breastplate, and nothing else, just... straddling some sort of creek?

#### TREXEL

Yeah.

#### DAVID

Just dangling...

#### TREXEL

That's a business creek.

#### DAVID

...in-into the creek--

#### TREXEL

That's a business creek.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

All polar bears do all of their business above a creek. It's in case maybe a salmon's in there.

#### DAVID

Okay, so we're going to need some creeks?

#### TREXEL

David, let's not get ahead of ourselves.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

But what I was going to say-- I don't-- I don't wanna-- I don't wanna shoot that idea down...

#### DAVID

Right, I will just-- I'll-- I'll put it in the note--

#### TREXEL 

_(shouting)_ Don't write it down!

#### DAVID

No-- okay-- oh--

#### TREXEL

It's not confirmed yet!

#### DAVID

Nope, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone. It's gone.

#### TREXEL

But what we need to do, is we need to make one darn tootin' good Arctic planet. And we need to make it *pretty, pretty* thoroughly, because... I'm not gonna say that the polar bears will come and get us, but--

#### TREXEL and DAVID

_(overlapping)_ --polar bears will come and get us.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

You know, quicker than the Board. Quicker than Hartro. Quicker than IMOGEN. Polar bear, knock-knock, maul maul, power stance, leave.

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ Hail the Board! And beware the bear.

#### DAVID

Right. Okay. Okay, so, we need to get this very right. Right. So, we ne--

#### TREXEL

Yes. So-- so go over the key details, David.

#### DAVID

Okay, so--

#### TREXEL

Key, key details.

#### DAVID

We know-- Okay.

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ 'Cause there's a lot of stuff in that brief.

#### DAVID

So all of their lovely Arctic glaciers are melting, [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] so they're going to go and find somewhere nice and cold. [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] Preferably a whole planet, covered in snow and ice... [__TREXEL:__ Sure!] They say, "so long, and thanks for all the seals"...?

#### TREXEL

I don't understand. [__DAVID:__ No.] I-- I'm assuming maybe there was some sort of trade deal where we gave them seals...

#### DAVID

Okay. So they like seals?

#### TREXEL

They love-- they love a seal!

#### DAVID 

_(crosstalk)_ 'Cause they-- they said, "thank you for the seals".

#### TREXEL

Oh, they love a seal!

#### DAVID

Okay, and they need other--

#### TREXEL

Friend and dinner!

#### DAVID

Okay, well--

#### TREXEL

The dog of the sea.

#### DAVID

Well, exactly! So, "other cold-weather creatures for me to feast on. [__TREXEL:__ Okay.] The cuter, the better." Would you say seals are cute?

#### TREXEL

Oh, they're adorable.

#### DAVID

Okay, and--

#### TREXEL

They're adorable.

#### DAVID

Are they cold-weather creatures?

#### TREXEL

Yes. They-- they will swim in-- in frigid water.

#### DAVID

Oh, so we need *water* as well?

#### TREXEL

Ah, that's a good point, David! I hadn't-- Well, yeah, an Arctic planet doesn't necessarily mean entirely, *entirely* snow and ice. [__DAVID:__ Right.] There'll be snow, yes. There'll be ice, yes. Some of the snow and ice will be in the water, yes, but as you can tell from my previous sentence, I mentioned water 'cause there's also water there! So--

#### DAVID

Right, and some sort of ocean full of seals.

#### TREXEL

Exactly. Exactly. Exactly. So what we want is basically a resort of sorts. [__DAVID:__ Mm.] A polar bear resort. [__DAVID:__ Okay.] You are... in your natural habitat, which is to say the frigid Arctic waste.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

But guess what? Not so frigid, not so Arctic, not so waste. Little warmer, little nicer...

#### DAVID

Well, no. I mean--

#### TREXEL

...Deck chairs...

#### DAVID

Nooo...

#### TREXEL

...Maybe some heating fans--

#### DAVID

No.

#### TREXEL

Oh no, it's all melted again! David, I've-- I've made a mistake.

#### DAVID

Yes. No, you-- you want it to be very cold. [__TREXEL:__ It has to be very--] I mean, keep the deck chairs!

#### TREXEL

Sure!

#### DAVID

But you n-- just very cold.

#### TREXEL

But every time I try and think of this-- this holiday planet, you know, for-- for the bears, [__DAVID:__ 'Kay.] I'm just thinking, "Oh that's nice. Bit cold, though!"

#### DAVID

Well, what do you--

#### TREXEL

"Warm it up!"

#### DAVID

What do you like to be-- What do you like to--

#### TREXEL

"Warm it up!" Hot ice, is that a thing?

#### DAVID

No. What do you like to be cold for?

#### TREXEL

I like to be cold for... Ooh, ooh, ooh! The conversations I had with my parents.

#### DAVID

Right. So if you were going to go to a planet, [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] that was entirely to have a conversation with your parents--

#### TREXEL 

_(yells)_ Leave me *alone,* I'm a big boy now!

#### DAVID

Oh, *no.* Oh, no.

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ Warning: consultant spiraling.

#### TREXEL 

_(yells)_ Leave me alone!

#### DAVID

Okay. But what's the *planet* like?

#### TREXEL 

_(suddenly calm)_ Oh, it's a lovely planet.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

Very cold.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Very chilly.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

To match the, uh-- the temperature of the relationship between me, my father; me, my mother; my mother, my father; my mother and father and the rest of the world.

#### DAVID

Okay. So... if you were to personify those relationships as a *planet*...

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

...What would it look like?

#### TREXEL

Big ball of ice full of seals.

##### [beat]

#### DAVID

Well, that's perfect!

#### TREXEL

Okay! We'll build one of those! Okay, so we're doing-- you know, I'm sure we can find pretty-- pretty standard-- Let's-- let's not make it *too* big. Let's not make it *too* big. I found large ecosystems, they're tricksy. You think, 'well that's all cold. How would it get hot?' It's too big, moon smashes into it, lava everywhere. [__DAVID:__ Oh.] So you want a nice-- just sort of a-- a small little dinky holiday planet. We can turn the thermostat just right down and it'll-- it'll make it very cold, [__DAVID:__ Mm-hmm.] it'll make the glaciers form, [__DAVID:__ Mm-hmm.] they'll flow from the mountain-- Make it jagged. You know, this is something I've found-- you know, I'm a professional planet designer. I have a pretty, pretty, pretty basic idea of geography, and I know that if you want a good glacier, got to have some mountains. Otherwise, what's it gonna slide down?! [__DAVID:__ Oh!] So, you want it to be mountainous, you want it to be rocky, and then the ice goes on top of that. Otherwise it's just-- it's just an orb. It's just a smooth orb of ice.

#### DAVID

Okay so we've-- we've broadly got the idea of the planet--

#### TREXEL

Bounciness, relatively small, turn down the thermostat, [__DAVID:__ Lots of seals...] the ice will come.

#### DAVID

Okay, so that's-- that's how we do it, so--

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

But how do we get the water *onto* the planet?

#### TREXEL

Ah. This is a secret. You know ice?

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

It's kind of like angry water. It's incalcitrant water that's like, "Nope! Not gonna flow!" But if you tickle it, just in the right way with heat, it becomes water. [__DAVID:__ Okay.] So this ice will just naturally form from the moisture in the air. It'll just suck it out of the air, [__DAVID:__ Okay.] it'll make it hard and solid. And then we're just gonna add a little bit of heat. Just a little bit-- and I know, David, we've had problems with heat earlier.

#### DAVID

Yes. Hot ice, not a thing.

#### TREXEL

Hot ice, not a thing. That's just water, and-- and as I say, that's water! So you just-- you just heat the ice up a little bit, and, oh, what's that? What's that coming out? That's water. Bam! Ocean.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

So we need to-- we-- and it sounds counterintuitive, but trust me-- cold planet? Heating elements at the coastlines.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

Below the surface, just so that you have a nice, constant flow of water, and then the water will flow out into the wider ocean, [__DAVID:__ Mm-hmm.] and then some of it will evaporate up into the clouds, then some of that will rain back on top of the glaciers, and then guess what? It's frozen again. [__DAVID:__ Ahh!] And that-- that gently shifts down, and it's just a nice cyclical cycle! [__DAVID:__ Right.] As cyclical cycles often are.

#### DAVID

Yes, okay, so. You've got the polar bears, they're on the ice, [__TREXEL:__ Yes!] in their armour, [__TREXEL:__ Sure.] stancing around...

#### TREXEL

They fight.

#### DAVID

Are we putting any creeks? [__TREXEL:__ Hmm?] Wait. __[pause]__ They fight?

#### TREXEL

Yes. Why do you think they wear armour? Why would you wear armour?

#### DAVID

I...

#### TREXEL

Obviously, to intimidate your foes, but...

#### DAVID

...fashion.

#### TREXEL

Fashion?

#### DAVID

Because it's shiny.

#### TREXEL

Well-- sure, lots of things are shiny that aren't fashion.

#### DAVID

But not-- not fashionable things that you wear.

#### TREXEL

Well, sure. So we're gon-- we want some creeks, because creeks... Hmm, I don't know how I'm gonna make a creek work, David. I don't know. Because... it's cold. Will the creek not freeze?

#### DAVID

Well... what if... there was a designated business part of the planet, [__TREXEL:__ Ahhh...] which was just creeks?

#### TREXEL

Just creeks. What, like a verdant creek? Or an *icy* creek?

#### DAVID

Well, ic-- icy creek. They want somewhere nice and cold, so it has to still be an icy creek.

#### TREXEL

But not *so* icy that the water's all frozen.

#### DAVID

Yes!

#### TREXEL

Okay, okay-- This will involve potentially more heating elements, David, and I just want to warn you...

#### DAVID

Well, we've got to keep it in its own special place!

##### [beat]

#### TREXEL

I don't understand.

#### DAVID

Some sort of zone.

#### TREXEL

You can't just point at a zone and say, "Well, that'll be less cold!" You've got to *do* something about it. [__DAVID:__ *(mumbled)* Well, Hartro did want... detail.] You can't-- you can't-- you can't just say, "Oh, it'll be in a hotter zone", and then just assume the planet will do what you want-- Planets don't *listen*.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

You've got to put a heating element in there, David.

#### DAVID

Okay, so what-- well, what do you want to do when you want to make a very specific place hot but not the places around it? [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] You get some sort of tiny... sun?

#### TREXEL

Yes! We could bury very, very small suns, [__DAVID:__ Hmm!] just under the surface, not big enough to cause a problem! Just tiny little-- tiny little suns. I'm sure we have some sort of particle accelerator that could *smash* something together to make a micro-sun. I'm pretty sure we've got one of those.

#### DAVID

Okay!

#### TREXEL

I'll ask for one.

#### DAVID

Ask!

#### TREXEL

I'll ask for one.

#### DAVID

Okay!

#### TREXEL

Hang on. _(yells)_ Do we have a particle accelerator?

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ Procurement request.

#### TREXEL

Could you just type that into IMOGEN. Just, uh... just, uh...

#### DAVID 

__[typing]__ Do... we... have...

#### TREXEL

Just irrelevantly.

#### DAVID

...a particle accelerator?

#### TREXEL

What does it say?

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ Responding...

#### DAVID

"Why do you want this, Trexel?"

#### TREXEL

Wh-- how-- how is it asking-- how did you know *I* was asking when *David* was typing?

#### DAVID 

__[typing]__ How did you know I... brackets-- that's Trexel saying that to me, David... but I, David, that's me typing, was typing.

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ Responding...

#### TREXEL 

_(softly)_ What's it-- what's it say?

#### DAVID

"Because you're typing from Trexel's office."

#### TREXEL

Ahhh... IMOGEN, you get me every time. Tell IMOGEN... [__DAVID:__ Okay.] that we want it for *valid* planetary design reasons.

#### DAVID 

__[typing]__ Valid planetary design reasons.

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ Responding...

#### DAVID

"And what are those?"

#### TREXEL

Oh my God-- um... it's-- I-- we're trying to make micro-suns.

#### DAVID 

__[typing]__ We're trying to make... micro-suns.

#### TREXEL 

_(stuttering)_ *Safe* micro-suns.

#### DAVID

Okay. __[typing]__ Safe micro-suns.

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ Responding...

#### DAVID

Uh-- it's just a string of pictures of knives?

#### TREXEL

Oh, that-- that-- that means no. No... no, Trexel, it's not gonna happen at all, so if you continue to ask it, I will turn your chair into knives. So, okay! [__DAVID:__ *(worried)* Oh!] we do have a particle accelerator, but apparently, it's not for us. So we can't-- we can't do suns, David, I'm sorry.

#### DAVID 

__[typing]__ Sorry...

#### TREXEL

Sorry. Just type sorry.

#### DAVID

Okay, I'll just type "sorry".

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ Apology accepted.

#### TREXEL

Okay, so we're gonna-- we're gonna have to use heating elements. [__DAVID:__ Right!] We're gonna have to use them. We're gonna have to bury them under the-- I'd have loved to use suns.

#### DAVID

Well...

#### TREXEL

Wouldn't that have been fun.

#### DAVID

Well... IMOGEN said no.

#### TREXEL

Yeah, well you know what? IMOGEN can--

##### [low tone beeping, knives unsheathe]

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Apology nullified.

#### TREXEL 

_(haltingly)_ Can continue to be an integral part of our lives... and a system that I deeply respect... and I would like my chair to remain... not-knives.

##### [beeping stops, knives retract]

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ Watch it, buster!

#### TREXEL

So we're going to-- we're going to have to sort of artificially heat some of the planet, [__DAVID:__ Okay!] to-- to allow for-- for creeks.

#### DAVID

Well, what if we just had a very small heating element--

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

--just under the surface--

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

--turn it on--

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

--and it will melt around, but because it's very small--

#### TREXEL

Sure.

#### DAVID

--it will only melt... that bit? But, you know, it'll have to be a small business zone with small creeks to power stance over, [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] but, you know-- well, we don't know how many friends Lorek Brynison has? Sooo...

#### TREXEL

I'm having-- a little-- a little friend's come into my brain. Knock knock on the door. "Hello, anybody home?" "Yes."

#### DAVID

It's me. Hello!

#### TREXEL

"Trexel's here."

#### DAVID

Oh.

#### TREXEL

Trexel's here-- It's in *my* brain, David.

#### DAVID

Oh, sorry.

#### TREXEL

Trexel's in. What do you want, thought? "Um, hey, you are thinking of putting lots and lots of different heating elements on the planet of a bear that is *incredibly* cross that you've heated all of its other planets to destruction?" We need to conceal these, David.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

If they find heating elements, they're gonna smell a trap. And sure, are we gonna leave loads of capacity unused in these heating elements so at any moment we could just turn up the temperature and melt it right out from under them? Yes! We are going to do that.

#### DAVID

Oh.

#### TREXEL

But they can't *know.*

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

They can't *know,* David.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

So we're gonna have to disguise them-- __[gasps]__ disguise them as seals! Disguise the heating elements as seals. "Oh, look, a lovely seal friend. Ooh, ooh, ooh, all gathering at the coastline. Look, a seal's in the creek, isn't that nice?" And they're just robots, David!

#### DAVID

Wait, no, wait--

#### TREXEL

Robot heating elements swimming around--

#### DAVID

*Trexel*.

#### TREXEL

What? What? What?

#### DAVID

We need to go into roleplay.

#### TREXEL

Sure.

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ Roleplay holovision initiated.

##### [electronic powering on sound]

#### DAVID

Okay, so you are a polar bear.

#### TREXEL

Okay, okay, yes.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

Right. _(imitating bear)_ "Growl, growl. Humans, growl."

#### DAVID

Yes. And-- and, so, you are-- you are in a business meeting.

#### TREXEL

"Oh. Buy low! Sell high. That quarterly report is *not* accurate!"

#### DAVID

Dangling over a creek.

#### TREXEL

"Oh, look at this. Look at my power stance. Guess where my business is! I'll never tell."

#### DAVID

Yes. __[mutters]__ Okay everyone can see. You see a seal!

#### TREXEL

"Look, a lovely seal! Ooh, perhaps it's a mid-business meeting snack. I'm gonna pick up the seal now..."

#### DAVID

Yes, yes.

#### TREXEL

"I'm gonna take a bite..."

#### DAVID

Oh, it's a robot! Oh, it's a heating robot!

#### TREXEL

It's full of heating elements! David, we can't do this!

#### DAVID

No.

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ Roleplay holovision terminated.

##### [electronic powering off sound]

#### TREXEL

There's a-- David-- what-- they-- the-- the-- the seals are there to *eat!*

#### DAVID

So what *don't* polar bears eat?

#### TREXEL

Um. Um. What do--

#### DAVID

What do polar bears find incredibly *boring*? That they will never want to interact with them. But they won't, like, notice them and go, "ooh what's that doing there?" It's just so boring they'll just ignore them.

#### TREXEL

Accountants.

#### DAVID

Okay, so acco-- _(cuts self off)_

#### TREXEL

Yes. Yes! We will have a series of accountants... because obviously, bears love to make deals, but they're big picture people. [__DAVID:__ Riiight...] They don't like-- they don't like the numbers, they just growl and people give them deals! There have to be accountants somewhere, but nobody notices 'em, nobody wants to see them. So we just have loads of accountants swimming around, [__DAVID:__ Just-- Yeah.] but the accountants are heating elements.

#### DAVID

Yes, they're very hot robots.

#### TREXEL

And they've all got little briefcases, and those briefcases? That's the battery.

#### DAVID

Exactly.

#### TREXEL

That's the battery.

#### DAVID

Okay, so they just walk around the *business* zone, [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] because *business* is happening, [__TREXEL:__ Yes, yes.] that's where the *creeks* come from, [__TREXEL:__ Yeah.] and then you've got all of them on beach holidays, which is why they are lining the coastline [__TREXEL:__ Sure!] full of accountants. [__TREXEL:__ Sure!] Right, well we've out of time--

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Would you like to submit?

#### DAVID

--so that's basically that.

#### TREXEL

Wonderful. That seems-- that seems top.

#### DAVID

Goodbye!

#### IMOGEN 

__[chime, pneumatic tube hissing]__ Submitting.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

That seems absolutely top.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

I haven't put accountants on a planet in a long time!

#### DAVID

Robot accountants, as well.

#### TREXEL

Yeah-- exactly! Exactly.

#### DAVID

You know, we seem to have a running theme of robots on the last three planets.

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ We've got-- we've got very robot-y recently.

#### DAVID

Yes. Hmm.

#### TREXEL

I think-- You know why? Do you know why?

#### DAVID

Why?

#### TREXEL

Because as one is forced to, you know, __[chuckles]__ look at the details of things, one just begins to say, "Robots?"

#### DAVID

Robots.

#### TREXEL

"Put a robot on it."

#### DAVID

Okay!

#### TREXEL

Because robots already exist! We actually don't have to describe how robots work, but then you just--

#### DAVID

Because people just know!

#### TREXEL

People just know.

#### DAVID

__[stammers]__ The Build Team's just like, "Oh, a robot! Oh!"

#### TREXEL

"Oh, a robot. We make those."

#### DAVID

One of your common garden-variety robots!

#### TREXEL

Look, that's a common robot! I've got 30 in my garden. And then you just program it to do a certain thing! I'm not a programmer, David. Are you a programmer?

#### DAVID

No.

#### TREXEL

Guess what? Neither are the Build Team! _(whispers)_ There's a separate team that does that.

#### DAVID

Oh!

#### TREXEL

They can pass it down, David!

#### DAVID

Ahh...

#### TREXEL

And Programming will sort that out. So...

#### DAVID

All right! Well... that's, um, actually, maybe good?

#### TREXEL

Yes! Takes a bit of the burden off of them.

#### DAVID

For 20 minutes...

#### TREXEL

Yeah! Not bad.

#### DAVID

So tomorrow is the review...

#### TREXEL

Sure.

#### DAVID

Do you think we went into enough detail?

#### TREXEL

I would say so. And also, quick thought--if I said no, what would you do? If I said, "No, David, I don't think we've had enough detail", what would you actually do?

#### DAVID

Uhhh...

#### TREXEL

What would you-- what-- what would that *give* you, David?

#### DAVID

Uhhh...

#### TREXEL

You've-- you're s-- you gotta open up your mind to the bigger picture. You're such a-- you're such a *small* detail clone, just-- just picking your way through the facts, like a-- [__DAVID:__ Yes.] like the floor's covered in eggs. And you need to pick up those eggs and make an omelette out of life! You understand?

#### DAVID

Right... I think so.

#### TREXEL

Absolutely. Now, I need to find some moisturiser to drink, because I've come to have a taste for it. So, I will see you after the weekend.

#### DAVID 

_(quickly)_ No.

#### TREXEL

Enjoy yourself.

#### DAVID

Friday.

#### TREXEL

Rem-- What?

#### DAVID

Friday is the review, that's tomorrow.

#### DAVID

Oh, is it not-- __[pause]__ Oh, thank you, David! I was just gonna go to sleep for three days. So, okay. Fine! Right. Fine.

#### DAVID 

_(nervously)_ So see-- see you tomorrow?

#### TREXEL

I will see you at some point over the next few days.

#### DAVID 

_(crosstalk)_ Right, no. Bright and early, because Hartro is here andshe is your boss.

#### TREXEL

I will see you at *an* morning.

#### DAVID

Please make it tomorrow.

#### TREXEL

Sure, that's a day.

#### DAVID

*Thank* you.

#### TREXEL

That *is* a day.

#### DAVID

Was it that hard? Good! Good, I'm glad--

#### TREXEL

Is what hard?

#### DAVID

Jus-- no, that's fine. Good--

#### TREXEL

I've left now.

##### [door swooshes closed]

#### DAVID

No--Oh, he did. Okay... Make an omelette. I can't do anything if he... _(realisation)_ I need to learn to program. Hmm. IMOGEN, how do I learn to program?

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ Access granted. Programming tutorial.
