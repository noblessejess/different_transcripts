Hi everyone, Alex here. Just taking a moment to give you an update on our Patreon. We've been reading out patron names at the start of all of our shows for a while now, as a way of saying thanks to our contributors. However, thanks to having such an amazingly generous fan base, our Patreon has actually been growing a lot faster than we had ever hoped, and we've ended up falling a bit behind in our shoutouts. As a result, starting from now, we're going to be increasing the number of names we read at the start of episodes to reduce the waiting time, and reviewing our records to make sure we haven't missed anyone. This does mean that the thanks segment before every episode will run slightly longer than it has previously, but it's the only way we can make sure we give proper credit to the people who make our content possible. So with that, I just personally wanted to say thanks to everyone for your patience and understanding, and we hope you enjoy today's episode. Eric Zagar, El Addams, John C. Worsley, Lauren, Katie Nolan, Jonathan Clark, Danielle Goldstein, Patrick Perry, Hilary Merline, Anton and Ken, Brooklyn Orchard, Benjamin 'Nothing but BS' Sussman, Slugfarm, Lottie Lynn, Valda Kylie, Emily Kellogg, Sarah Vakos, Monika Cieślińska and Bojan Panic. Thank you all. We really appreciate your support. If you'd like to join them, go to www.patreon.com/rustyquill and take a look at our rewards.

#### DAVID 

_(nervous)_ Oh... where's the brief?! Wh-- where's Trexel, but that's kind of normal, but it-- it's Monday and there's no *brief!* __[footsteps approach]__ There's-- the light's not on, the tube isn't full, I-- I don't--

##### [door swooshes open]

#### TREXEL

Hot diggin' hog, it's Trexel time!

#### DAVID 

_(crosstalk)_ Trexel-- Trexel --

#### TREXEL

Hello, David, how are you?

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Access granted.

##### [bwoop of lights turning on]

#### DAVID

Trexel-- Umm,b-bad! There's no brief! It's Monday and there's no brief!

#### TREXEL

But it's Monday!

#### DAVID

There's no brief, and it's Monday!

#### TREXEL

Surely there's a brief!

#### DAVID

No, look, the tube is empty, the light is off!

#### TREXEL

Hang on a minute! Let me take off my glasses.

##### [sets glasses down]

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

And my other pair. [__DAVID:__ Ah!] And also this pair.

#### DAVID

O-- okay, it's--

#### TREXEL

Hang on. I need to put that last pair back on.

#### DAVID

Right. But the tube--

#### TREXEL

There's no brief!

#### DAVID

Exactly! And I don't know what's going on!

#### TREXEL

I'm *furious!*

#### DAVID

Yes! Exactly, there's no brief!

#### TREXEL

No, because I didn't need to turn up! If there's no brief, there's no work; if there's no work, why am I here?!

#### DAVID

Oh-- Well, g-given that I'm not currently in a blender, we could use this time to--

##### [heeled footsteps approach]

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ Line Manager arriving.

#### HARTRO

Oh, hello boys! __[David and Trexel scream in alarm]__ Oh, you look surprised!

#### TREXEL 

_(distraught, screaming)_ *Monday?!*

#### HARTRO

Hi!

#### TREXEL

*It's Monday and you're here!*

#### HARTRO

Yes!

#### TREXEL 

_(frantic, screaming)_ *Why!?*

#### HARTRO

Calm down!

#### TREXEL 

_(quieting down)_ Sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry.

#### HARTRO

That's not the way you welcome your line manager, Trexel!

#### DAVID

No, hello Hartro. Hello.

#### HARTRO

Now let's try that again.

#### TREXEL

Right.

#### HARTRO

Hello, boys.

#### DAVID 

_(simult.)_ Hello Hartro.

#### TREXEL 

_(simult.)_ Good hello.

#### HARTRO

Hmm. Yes, I've had an idea! That's why I'm here! [__TREXEL:__ Please.] Last Friday when I left, I just thought, "Oh, Hartro, they need some team-building exercises!" I don't know why I didn't think of that sooner! [__DAVID:__ Uhh--] And now I'm here, because back in my line manager school... ah, they taught us so many different little devices to teach people that just can't work together, and that's what we're gonna do.

#### TREXEL

Right. Right. It does come to mind, Hartro...

#### DAVID 

_(quietly)_ It's-- it's-- it's Mon-- it's Monday.

#### TREXEL

It's Monday. __[stuttering]__ And-- and we-- we do-- we build a planet on--

#### HARTRO

Are you trying to tell me how to do my job?

#### DAVID and TREXEL

_(frantically)_ No! No no no no no no no!

#### HARTRO

What, I can't come in on a Monday and educate my design team? What-- what, Hartro can't just decide to turn up and fix things that are broken?

#### TREXEL

No, Hartro, you can-- you can obviously do absolutely whatever you want, and you clearly have...

#### HARTRO 

_(crosstalk)_ Thank you. Thank you.

#### TREXEL

But you never have before! We-- we've done this *thousands* of times, Hartro, and you've-- you've never once turned up and tried to "build the team".

#### HARTRO

And that's an *interesting* point, because *I* would say in the past, your planets? Mmm, not so good. Would you agree?

#### TREXEL

Well... "good"-- art is subjective.

#### HARTRO

Yes.Not good, yes. And I-- and I think actually in the past, mmmm... couple weeks, I'd say you've been turning in your designs on time... uh...

#### TREXEL

Yes, I-- I suppose so.

#### HARTRO

Terrible planets, yes... __[David softly begins to object]__ so what I'm going to do is try to *salvage* this destroyed wreck of a ship.

#### TREXEL

Oh, this-- this real dumpster fire of a duo we've got going here.

#### HARTRO

Yeah!

#### TREXEL

Okay, I'm-- I'm game. Because it means I don't have to do actual work. _(aside)_ David, team building isn't actual work. I've heard about it. You just play fun games!

#### HARTRO

No, look serious, 'cause you're going to be graded on this.

#### DAVID

Oh-- oh.

#### TREXEL

Right, and--

#### HARTRO

But put these suits on...

##### [clothes shuffling]

#### DAVID

Um...

#### TREXEL

Oh.

#### HARTO

That's your team building suit.

#### DAVID

Oh.

#### TREXEL

Oh. Well, that's a... that's a very smart onesie you've got there, Hartro. Hang on, let's just pop these on--

##### [latex stretching]

#### DAVID

Oh. Oh, my--

#### HARTRO

They might be slightly uncomfortable, and that's all part of the building of the team.

#### TREXEL

Oh, it hikes, Hartro!

#### HARTRO

You-- The two of you are uncomfortable *together*.

#### TREXEL

It really grabs at the old... comets.

#### DAVID

So rubbery...

#### TREXEL

Oh!

#### DAVID

So squeaky!

#### HARTRO

Look how quickly David got into his. [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] Great, so, I'm going to get you both warmed up, all right? You're in your suits, you got your mind in the room... working together, working together. Right, so. Trexel?

#### TREXEL

Yes?

#### HARTRO

You're going to say a word in a minute.

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### HARTRO

Don't say it now. [__TREXEL:__ No...] and David 7 is going to just say the first word that comes to his mind!

#### DAVID

Uh, okay.

#### HARTRO

And then once you've done that, David 7--

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### HARTRO

--don't start now--then Trexel's going to do another word.

#### TREXEL

Word now? Word now? Sorry.

#### HARTRO

Would you just listen to the instructions? They're very simple.

#### TREXEL

I have so many words!

#### HARTRO

You say a word, David 7 reacts, you listen to the one he react-- just say words. Go.

#### TREXEL

Okay. Uh... Knife.

#### DAVID 

__[eeps]__ Trexel!

#### TREXEL

Er... sweaty.

#### DAVID

Uh, uh, David.

#### TREXEL

Knife.

#### DAVID

Uh... Trexel.

#### TREXEL

Moon.

#### DAVID

Um, trough.

#### TREXEL

Knife.

#### DAVID

Trexel?

#### HARTRO

Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

#### TREXEL

Sw-- What?

#### HARTRO

Trexel, stop saying knife.

#### TREXEL

But I'm just thinking about--

#### HARTRO

No, no, no, 'cause you're working together. Team-building. Words that bring you together. Look, could you just respond in a more 'team' way, please?

#### TREXEL

A-- a more 'team' way, okay.

#### HARTRO

Alright, David 7, you start.

#### DAVID

Um... __[stutters]__ Team.

#### TREXEL

Uh, build.

#### DAVID

Uhh-- Planets.

#### TREXEL

Good!

#### DAVID

Uh... David.

#### TREXEL

Team.

#### DAVID

David.

#### TREXEL

Teamwork.

#### DAVID 

__[stutters]__ Trexel?

#### TREXEL

Working effectively as a team.

#### DAVID

Latex.

#### HARTRO 

_(crosstalk)_ You say 'team' again, I will smack you.

#### TREXEL

I'm-- Okay, um, so...

#### HARTRO

I-imply team without saying team, Trexel.

#### TREXEL

Imply team but not team words. Okay, I can do this! I can do this!

#### HARTRO

Last chance. Go.

#### DAVID

I-IMOGEN.

#### TREXEL

Togetherness.

#### DAVID

Uhh, David.

#### TREXEL

Fortitude.

#### DAVID

Um, uh, planets?

#### TREXEL

Stickin' with it.

#### DAVID

Uhhh--

#### HARTRO

That's more than one word.

#### TREXEL

Sorry. Sticky...

#### HARTRO

Okay, stop it. Just forget it. Stop it. Stop it, you're warm. Okay? Fine. Done.

#### TREXEL

I'm hot.

#### DAVID

This suit is not very breathable...

#### TREXEL

It's-- No, it's not...

#### HARTRO

Stop complaining, this is a-- we're a team.

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ I've got about a half pint in me.

#### HARTRO

Great. Now that we're all warm, uh, I've just got something here...

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ Puppets deployed.

#### HARTRO

Bring this up... Right, so, little puppets. [__TREXEL:__ Ooh!] What-- this one's, uh, Trexel. This is for you, David 7.

#### TREXEL 

_(crosstalk, excited)_ That's a little me!

#### HARTRO

That's for you, David 7.

#### DAVID

Oh, uh, okay.

#### TREXEL

Did you make these?

#### HARTRO

Right-- I did *not*. I had them made.

#### TREXEL

They're very good.

#### HARTRO

And this is for you.

#### TREXEL

Thank you.

#### HARTRO

This is your clone.

#### TREXEL

Ah. It just says "clone" on it. Why doesn't it say "David 7"?

#### HARTRO

'Cause it's a clone.

#### TREXEL

Good point. Okay.

#### DAVID

Mine-- mine says "Trexel".

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### HARTRO

There's only one Trexel.

#### TREXEL

You know what--

#### HARTRO

__[cuts Trexel off]__ Don't read into that, shush.

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### HARTRO

Right. Now, what I'd like you to do, [__DAVID:__ Yes?] is just have a moment and act out a typical planet design session.

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### HARTRO

Right? Okay. So just--

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### HARTRO

Trexel-- Maybe Trexel--

#### TREXEL 

_(crosstalk)_ Well, and I-- and I-- I'm the clone, and-- and-- and David's me?

#### HARTRO

Yes. Yes, so this is you responding how Trexel normally would, David 7.

#### DAVID

Uh, yes.

#### HARTRO

And then Trexel, you're David 7, or "clone", [__TREXEL:__ Mm-hmm.] and you're in the room waiting for Trexel to arrive. [__TREXEL:__ Okay.] Well-- Just a typical day.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ Roleplay holovision initiated.

##### [electronic powering on sound, calm music playing in background]

#### TREXEL 

_(as David)_ "Ahh! I'm David 7, a clone, and I'm waiting for Trexel. I love Trexel --"

#### DAVID 

_(as Trexel)_ "Blerrrgh! I'm so late and drunk! I've been at the Cosmic Lounge, not at work! Hey, David, have we got the brief? What? You haven't done any work, despite not being able to do any work because I control everything in this office? Well, that's *your* fault somehow! I've just rolled out of booze bed, and want you to do your work!"

#### TREXEL 

_(as David)_ ...I see. "Well, ...Trexel, I've been sitting here crying, because I'm a big crybag! Oh, I could do things myself, but I'm--"

#### DAVID 

_(as Trexel)_ "Shut up, David! I don't care about your well-being, because I'm Trexel Geistman. Now, do you have a brief?"

#### TREXEL 

_(as David)_ "Yes, I have a brief for you."

#### DAVID 

_(as Trexel)_ "Then get on with it! Shut up, David!"

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ Roleplay paused.

##### [electronic powering off sound]

#### HARTRO

...I'm just gonna pause you there... Now-- now, boys... this is good! This is good. Now--

#### DAVID 

_(as Trexel)_ "Oh, Hartro, I love you. Please, I'm sad about my parents!"

#### TREXEL

You shut up.

#### DAVID 

_(as Trexel)_ "I think of you as a mother figure and I really want--"

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ You shut your damn puppet mouth! _(shouting)_ Come here, you--!

##### [sounds of Trexel strangling David]

#### HARTRO

Hey! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it right now!

#### TREXEL 

_(screaming)_ Breathe no more, you puppet! Gah!

##### [gurgling sounds from David, followed by winded panting]

#### HARTRO

Trexel, it's just a puppet. You-- you need to calm down.

#### DAVID

That was really my neck...

#### HARTRO

NowI'd like you to go stand in the corner... [__TREXEL:__ Okay.] and breathe and 10 seconds of breathing. If you don't come back here calm, _(gritted teeth)_ *if you don't come back here calm*... I will *make* you calm.

#### TREXEL

Okay, okay. I'm sorry. I just-- puppet-me really got to real-me.

##### [latex-clad footsteps recede]

#### HARTRO

Right, now, David 7... [__DAVID:__ Uhh...] I noticed in that, uh, typical design meeting, there wasn't much *designing* going on.

#### DAVID

No.

#### HARTRO

Hmm.

##### [beat]

##### [latex-clad footsteps returning]

#### TREXEL 

_(quiet)_ I'm back now.

#### HARTRO

Right.You look calm. [__TREXEL:__ Thank you.] But, we can just do it again... Give him back his puppet, Trexel.

#### TREXEL

Okay, I did tear it a little...

#### DAVID

Oh, his-- his nose has come off.

#### HARTRO

Now, you're going to do it again, and this time, you're going to do a design meeting the way that you *wish* that it would go, all right? So, David 7, the way you *wish* Trexel would do a design meeting. And Trexel, the way you *wish* David 7 would behave in a design meeting.

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### DAVID

O-- okay.

##### [Trexel clears throat]

#### HARTRO

Remember, you're being graded.

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ Roleplay initiated.

##### [electronic powering on sound]

#### TREXEL

Ah. _(as David)_ "I'm... David 7 and I have patiently waited for Trexel. I understand he probably has things on."

#### DAVID 

_(as Trexel)_ "Good morning, David 7, I am here and it is nine o'clock in the morning. Have you got the brief yet?"

#### TREXEL 

_(as David)_ "Yes and not only that, I got up even earlier than that and made a start."

#### DAVID 

_(as Trexel)_ "Well that's good, because you live here and can't get out. Now, let's spend eight hours really thinking about how good this planet could be."

#### TREXEL 

_(as David)_ "Well, hey, let's not go overboard. How about we do half an hour, and then stop and finish?"

#### DAVID 

_(as Trexel)_ "No. I think we should work through lunch to make up for lost time."

#### TREXEL 

_(screaming)_ Are you *mad?!* Are you a madman?! Are you gonna kill me with a knife?!

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ Knife detected. Security alerted.

#### DAVID 

_(as Trexel, forcefully)_ "Ok! I think we should work *late* on this one, David!"

#### TREXEL

Hartro, you can't let this stand. It's clearly a delusional fool!

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ Roleplay holovision terminated.

##### [electronic powering off sound]

#### TREXEL

Work through lunch? *Stay late?* This isn't teamwork, this is madness!

#### HARTRO

Don't grab the puppet. Just give me the puppets. [__TREXEL:__ There you go.] Right. Trexel, I think we've all learned something there. I would say, perhaps, putting more time into the actual design might be appropriate! I think David 7 has a very valid point!

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

What many points he's having. Maybe he'll have *more* points soon, I don't know!

#### HARTRO

We're a team! A point that one of us makes is a point that we all make.

#### DAVID and TREXEL

Yes.

#### HARTRO

Isn't that true?

#### DAVID

Yes, we've all made the point. We--

#### TREXEL

We've all made a point. Together!

#### DAVID

--all-- Yes.

#### TREXEL

Not *at* anyone...

#### DAVID

No... we just all definitely made a point.

#### TREXEL

All making... *a* point!

#### HARTRO

And I'm going to give you this puppet, Trexel, and I would like you to return it to me in a better form. And I'd like *you* to do the sewing.

#### TREXEL

Right. Okay, I'll-- I'll sew this right up and get it back to you.

#### HARTRO

So, let's just try something different. I've got these two pieces of A3 paper. These are your islands of safety. Now, stand over there by the door, [__DAVID:__ Okay.] both of you over there. [__DAVID:__ Right, yes.] Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick. [__DAVID:__ Up, up up.] Right. So this is all lava now. __[David whoops in alarm]__ The-- the office is lava. Yes--

#### TREXEL

Calm down,David, it's a metaphor.

#### HARTRO

And you need to get across, both of you, without touching the lava using these two islands.

#### TREXEL

Right.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### HARTRO

Anybody-- If even a-- if even a toe goes in the lava, you both just explode.

#### DAVID

Waah! Aaah! Ah!

#### TREXEL

So everyone that's a person needs to get across, okay, right.

#### DAVID 

_(nervous)_ Okay, right.

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ Roleplay holovision initiated.

##### [electronic powering on sound]

#### DAVID

So, I think what we should do, is--

#### TREXEL

And jump! __[shoves David in]__

#### DAVID 

_(terrified)_ Aah! Ooh! I'm burning!

#### HARTRO

Oh, you just-- you just--

#### TREXEL

What?

#### DAVID 

_(yelling)_ Aaaah! Ooh! Oh, my limbs! __[pained sounds]__

#### HARTRO

Right. Trexel--

#### TREXEL

What?

#### HARTRO

What-- _(to David)_ You're not on-- you're not really burning, David 7. You're not--

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ It's not real lava, David. It's metaphor lava.

#### DAVID 

_(quietly)_ Oh. Oh.

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ Roleplay holovision terminated.

##### [electronic powering off sound]

#### HARTRO

What-- what didn't you understand about that? You've just pushed him into the lava.

#### TREXEL

Yes! Yes! I'm the only person on the team.

#### HARTRO

Okay, this just proved my point. This just completely proves my point!

#### TREXEL

But-- but he's a clone, he doesn't count!

#### HARTRO

You-- You're such an idiotic-- egotistical-- massive-- mattery-- flesh-sweating-- alcohol-- moisturiser. Stop looking at me. __[gagging]__ You make me sick.

#### TREXEL

Hartro, are you okay? You seem-- __[Hartro sighs]__ You're getting red, and-- and--

#### HARTRO

No, no, no, this is just-- just-- just-- just a bit more challenging than I thought it would be. Mm... we're gonna cut to the end! Stand together in the middle of the la-- I mean the floor. Just look at each other.

##### [latex suits noises]

#### TREXEL

Right.

#### DAVID

Oh, okay.

#### HARTRO

Right. Try not to screw this up. [__TREXEL:__ Okay.] __[deep sigh]__ Both of you look at each other. You are going to water each other's flowers.

#### TREXEL

I *beg* your pardon.

#### DAVID

Umm.

#### HARTRO

You are going to look at the other one, and tell them something they do well. Something you appreciate about the other. In a sense, watering their flowers! [__TREXEL:__ Okay.] Why don't you start, David 7, 'cause it's probably going to be easier for you.

#### DAVID

Um...Trexel, I... Umm...

#### TREXEL

Go on, David.

#### DAVID

Like... your... glasses.

#### TREXEL

Thank you. Which pair?

#### DAVID

Oh, um, number two, particularly.

#### TREXEL

Strong pair. Strong pair. M-my turn?

#### HARTRO

Yes.

#### TREXEL

David.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

I like... hm. Uh... um... no no, hang on, I'll get there. Uh... You, uh-- you write-- _(muttered)_ No, that's not really about *you*, is it? Um... __[clears throat]__ Okay, okay, okay. Ah! David... I like... many things. *Some* of them... have a relationship with you. Tangentially. Good? We done? __[long, disapproving pause]__ All right, I'll get more specific! I'll get more specific if you want!

#### HARTRO

Okay. Okay.What does David 7 do for you every time you come in and you design planets? You know, you come in, he's there. Maybe he smiles. Oh, I don't know, maybe he, uh, puts the, uh-- do you put the tube in?

#### DAVID

Oh, yes, yes, yes. I do. I do.

#### HARTRO

David-- He puts the tube in. Just say-- okay, I'll give you this one, I'll give you the first one. "David 7, [__TREXEL:__ Okay. Yes.] I like that you put the tube in at the end of our design sessions."

#### TREXEL

Okay! Okay, I can do this. I can do this. David--

#### HARTRO

Can you look at him when you do it?

#### TREXEL

Oh, sorry, okay. David. Hello. I like... that you do... what you are required to... at the end... _(abruptly)_ Yep.

#### HARTRO

This is-- this is ridiculous.

##### [overlapping argument]

#### TREXEL

It's just-- I just-- I thought I did it!

#### HARTRO

I mean, I have a headache. I have a headache.

#### DAVID 

_(stammering)_ Oh, well, I-I-I-I could-- I could-- I could go again? Oh.

##### [Hartro groans in exasperation]

#### TREXEL

Let David-- let David go again. Let David go again!

#### HARTRO

No, no, no. No, 'cause this isn't-- this isn't the Trexel show! This isn't "Why Is Trexel Good", this is *team building*, Trexel! [__TREXEL:__ One more time, please.] There's no team being built here! Now--

#### TREXEL

Please, give me one more chance.

#### HARTRO

No, I just-- I thought this was going to go better. I hate to say it, Trexel, but we might need to do a team restructure. [__DAVID:__ Uhh...] I mean, you were handing in the designs on time, and I thought, "Wow! There might be something to salvage here! Ooh, maybe I could get these two boys working together, and they might actually design a *good* planet!" And now I come here and I see you cannot even water one little David 7 flower.

#### TREXEL

Hartro, Hartro, please just... just give me one more chance. One more chance just to prove that I-- I *can* work as a team with-- with David.

#### HARTRO

Alright, fine. Fine. You say one nice thing about David 7 right now. Go.

#### TREXEL

Trexel, you've got a great face...Dahh, so close! So close!

#### HARTRO

Right, I will see you at the review, and... we'll see-- we'll see how it goes. [__TREXEL:__ Okay.] But I'm none too happy.

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ Line manager departing.

##### [door swooshes closed]

#### DAVID

Right. Um... "restructuring"?

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

What does-- what does that... mean?

#### TREXEL

Oh, you know, just shuffling things around.

#### DAVID

No, but-- but what does that actually *mean*?

#### TREXEL

You know, just making changes to the team.

#### DAVID

No, but what does that mean to* you?*

#### TREXEL

Oh, to me? Not a huge amount.

#### DAVID

Okay, but what does that mean to me?

#### TREXEL

Well, you'll find out.

#### DAVID

Well, no, but I-- I-I-I think I might know what it is, and-- and would like some information about what exactly a restructure might mean. To *me.*

#### TREXEL 

_(rapidly)_ It just means realignment of the skill resources of a team that contains me and you! And nothing's happening to me.

#### DAVID

Okay, so... *I'm* being realigned?

#### TREXEL

S-sure!

#### DAVID

And that is...

#### TREXEL

A refocusing of the resources that make you* you*.

#### DAVID

Okay, and are we talking about sort of genetic realignment, or-- or just--

#### TREXEL

Everything comes down to genetics in the end, David. [__DAVID:__ Oh, okay.] Don't be a-- don't be a-- don't be a-- a poltroon.

#### DAVID 

_(defeated)_ Okay. Um, could you say one nice thing ab-- Could you water my flowers? I'm having-- I'm-- I'm feeling quite--

#### TREXEL

But Hartro's-- Hartro's *gone.*

#### DAVID

Yeah, but, I'm feeling kind of low. It might be-- so just, you know, Trexel, you could just water-- water my-- my flowers?

#### TREXEL

All right, David! All right, I'll-- I'll try one last time for *you*. Because you're here. David... you make me feel good about myself. [__DAVID:__ Oh.] Because at least I'm not you.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

But hey, you haven't got long to dwell on that! [__DAVID:__ Umm.] Because we've got a review in a few days! [__DAVID:__ Yes.] So we've got three planets. Three planets, David, and then I don't know what will happen. I'm not sure. Let's just make 'em count. I mean obviously it's not gonna work, but let's just-- let's just-- let's just have fun with it, David!

#### DAVID

Um, well no, but-- _(quiet)_ Okay.

#### TREXEL

And then, you know, stuff will happen to both of us. More to you.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Less to me.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

You might die, is what I'm saying.

#### DAVID

Yeah, no, I-- I--

#### TREXEL

Are you understanding this? I mean, [__DAVID:__ Yes.] I'm sort of-- I'm just trying to be sensitive about this, so...

#### DAVID

No, I--

#### TREXEL

They're probably going to recycle you at the end of the next review.

#### DAVID 

_(crosstalk)_ No, I-- Yes, I-- I-I-I did guess what--

#### TREXEL

But we still got to do three more planets.

#### DAVID

Yes, I-- I know but--

#### TREXEL

And we should-- and it probably won't matter.

#### DAVID 

__[sighs]__ Trexel, haven't you got a party to go to?

#### TREXEL

No... no.

#### DAVID

Well, haven't you got a seat to sit alone in at the Cosmic Lounge?

#### TREXEL

I suppose I do! I suppose I do... I don't know why, David, but I feel really down. Maybe I ate a weird olive. Hm. Let's not analyse it too much, we might learn things about ourselves! Bye bye!

##### [door swooshes closed]

#### DAVID 

_(flatly)_ Bye. Right. Time to get serious.
