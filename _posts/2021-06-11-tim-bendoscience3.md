#### BRYN

Hello, and welcome to "Tim and Ben Do Science, part three." I am your host today, the special Stellar Firma guest Bryn Monroe. Those of you who have listened to "Tim and Ben Do Science, part one," and "Tim and Ben Do Science, part two," will know what we're about today, but uh, just to put any doubts to rest in your mind, I am of course joined by...

#### BEN

Tim Meredith.

#### TIM

A-and Ben Meredith. Oooh, we're having fun. Because people can't tell us apart already. Ohh, 'cause we have the same voice.

##### [Bryn begins to laugh]

#### BEN

Yes.

#### TIM

We've got the same Meredith larynx. I'm Tim. Come on. Let's be sensible.

#### BEN

I'm Ben, you silly billies.

#### TIM

You silly goose. And Bryn, if you're the most special host, can I be just, the most specialist boy?

#### BRYN

I mean, I think that's yet to be established. That'll depend on how well you do.

#### TIM

I feel like I'm a special little boy, and Ben's this guy over here. [__BEN:__ Well, we'll see.] Like, and that's how you tell us apart.

#### BEN

We shall see who gets given the certificate.

#### TIM

Okay.

#### BRYN

Yeah, well, this is our third [__TIM:__ And final!] Tim and Ben Do Science. Third and final. [__TIM:__ It's for all the beans.] The series is over. [__TIM:__ Yeah.] I'm very sad.

#### TIM

It's done. If you've heard it now--

#### BRYN

I've not. I'm pretending to be sad because I have yet to hear the final couple of episodes.

#### BEN

I thought it was rubbish.

#### TIM

Yeah, Ben didn't care for it.

#### BEN

I didn't like it at all.

#### TIM

And weirdly, you can tell that in his performance. [__BEN:__ Yeah yeah yeah, real lackluster.] Like, he's delivering his lines like, 'Oh, what a denouement this is.'

##### [Ben makes some buzzy David 7 lip sounds]

#### BRYN

So we are in fact recording this episodes before the final two or three episodes of the series air. So I haven't found them, and that means you are from my interrogation of any science crimes that may occur in those final couple of episodes.

#### TIM

It's just time tables and people being fine in black holes. You'd hate it, Bryn.

#### BEN

I think there were some specific bits of the script that Tim did write thinking, "Bryn's gonna hate this."

#### TIM

Yeah, most of it.

#### BEN

'Cause it's bad, not 'cause it's scientifically inaccurate. It's just rubbish.

#### TIM

No, yeah, it's really scientifically accurate, but it's very bad narrative.

#### BEN

Yeah, it's just terrible.

#### TIM

The character development is awful.

#### BRYN

I mean, as someone who loves high school American TV teen dramas, I can promise you I have no problem with terrible narratives.

#### TIM

That's true.

#### BEN

Alright, there you go, you're our target audience.

#### TIM

Yeaaah. Yeah, 'cause outside of your science, your brain is otherwise comprised entirely of trash.

#### BRYN

_(laughing)_ Pretty much. Pretty much. So, for season one of Stellar Firma, our two wonderful characters Trexel Geistman and David 7 spent the entire season, as I recall, designing planets.

#### BEN

Yeah.

#### TIM

Correct.

#### BRYN

And I was brought in afterwards at the end of the season to talk about science with the two of you. Because there was loads of science'ish stuff discussed in that season. [__BEN:__ Science adjacent.] Frequently.

#### TIM

Science-esque.

#### BRYN

Science-esque. I mean, it is in the very loosest of terms 'science fiction,' [__TIM:__ Yeah!] and uh, so, yeah, it seemed like a great idea at the time.

#### TIM

Can you be a scientisn't? If you can be a scientist? Are we scientisn'ts?

#### BEN

I think we are scientisn'ts.

#### BRYN

That's... Right. Sure.

#### TIM

It's an excellent joke, you have to admit. __[begins to chuckle loudly at his own joke]__

#### BRYN

Okay...

#### TIM

You _have_ to admit.

#### BRYN

Do I have to admit that? Do I, though?

#### TIM

You do, contractually.

#### BRYN

And as I recall, Ben took home a stunning victory from the first Tim and Ben Do Science episode.

#### BEN

Yes, yes. I did, I did.

#### TIM

Yes. It was a rout. It was a rout. I was very embarrassed.

#### BRYN

And then Tim felt awful and did a whole bunch of research and preparation.

#### BEN

He didn't.

#### TIM

Thank you, BBC Bitesize.

#### BEN

Did you act-- Oh! __[begins laughing loudly]__

#### BRYN

In season two, Trexel and David spend uh, most of the season selling planets.

#### TIM

That's my domain.

#### BRYN

Which involved a lot less discussion of the technical details of the planets. [__TIM:__ Yeah.] But there was still enough for me to spin little bits and pieces out there.

#### TIM

Yeah.

#### BRYN

Then you ended at this season in, what was it, the Internal Complaints Department, if I remember correctly?

#### BEN

Expediting, yeah.

#### TIM

Expediting.

#### BRYN

Yeah. And now in season three, in season three, what has our course been? We spent most of the season-- The bulk of the season was in Consultancy.

#### BEN

Yes. Not in a beautiful little café like I wanted.

#### BRYN

And the final chunk in Business Warfare.

#### TIM/BEN

Yes.

#### BRYN

And I have to confess, it's been a lot harder to find in-depth discussions of anything approaching scientific relevance in this wonderful, wonderful season three. I would say the average episode had one, sometimes two, sentences that I could vaguely relate to something scientific and bring up as an excuse to quiz you.

#### BEN

That's great! That's, you know, taking the tour.

#### TIM

And the thing about this is, because I did very poorly in our first episode of this, and there was a lot of science to get through-- I, actually, 'won' is a strong term. But let's say I beat Ben and it was embarrassing for him in the second version of Tim and Ben Do Science. [__BRYN:__ You did indeed.] And that was about a series that had much less science. Now, if we follow the rules, the statistical line--

#### BEN

I might as well leave.

#### TIM

That means this season, which has the least of all science, I should ace.

#### BRYN

It is indeed, the score is one-all, and in this scientifically-- This porosity of scientific information, we'll see just what I can spend out.

#### BEN

I'm also gonna say just quickly to anybody who's thinking like, 'Oh, well, maybe they'll make it a draw, to have like a nice--' Absolutely not.

#### TIM

No, absolutely no. No, that's--

#### BEN

This is gonna be a proper, an intellectual knife fight. [__TIM:__ Yeah.] Street rules.

#### BRYN

I mean I should also should mention, having just talked about how difficult it was to dig up scientific things to discuss in this season... It would be remiss of me not to mention, of course, the glorious, glorious episode 62.

#### TIM

What was that?

#### BRYN

Episode 62 being the one where nearly every reaction I saw was 'I can't wait for Bryn to listen to this one.' And, in fact, [__TIM:__ Which one was this?] I'm pretty sure episode 62 canonized me as a character within the Stellar Firma universe.

#### BEN

Oh, yes! There was an annoying science man.

#### BRYN

David 7 looks something up on IMOGEN and literally says 'there's just a picture of an angry man with glasses shaking his head at us.'

#### BEN

Yes, yep, yep, yep.

#### BRYN

And I don't know about you guys, but I certainly choose to believe that that is me. That I am the angry man with glasses. [__TIM:__ You're in the show.] [__BEN:__ Definitely heavily implied.] And I now exist within the Stellar Firma universe.

#### BEN

Uncredited cameo, let's say.

#### TIM

Yeah.

#### BRYN

I am part of Rusty Quill. I was invited to do the science episodes for Stellar Firma, specifically because I have a scientific background. I have an undergraduate degree in applied mathematics, and a master's degree in theoretical physics -- with a specialty in cosmology, and my master's dissertation was on the topic of black holes. And since episode 62 included some in-depth discussion of black holes, and exactly what they mean, that was indeed playing in my house. And we will come back to episode 62 later. Okay, so, I have to say Tim, you mentioned when we did Tim and Ben Do Science number two that you'd been reading a lot of Bill Bryson as a way to prepare. [__TIM:__ I have, yes.] Have you put in any special background preparation this time?

#### TIM

Well, I have listened to more Bill Bryson, but it has been more sort of travel-based Bill Bryson. Much less science, not as helpful. I've listened to a lot of Cautionary Tales, an excellent podcast which taught me about things like Get-There-Itis, a psychological principle that affects pilots and ships' captains and things like that. [__BEN:__ Yep.] Not a lot of science, though, so, I'm a little worried.

#### BRYN

And Ben... after your distressing, narrow, I will stress narrow defeat, in--

#### BEN

Yeah, yeah. Yeah yeah yeah.

#### TIM

Confirmed, narrow but decisive.

#### BRYN

Tim and Ben Do Science one, it was a crushing victory on your-- And then followed by a narrow, but embarrassing, defeat.

#### BEN

Yeah, no, 'cause if we're considering the whole series as a continuous thing, I'm still ahead. It's just, you know, we decided to sort of, to discretely sever it.

#### TIM

It's not points accumulated.

#### BRYN

I mean, that's one interpretation.

#### BEN

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's my hypothesis, is that I'm winning.

#### TIM

You're scum.

#### BRYN

Have you put in any preparation hours in order to reclaim your crown, or are you coasting on your natural ability?

#### BEN

I've just mainly been listening about the rise of fascism in the early 20th century, which I don't-- It's not like, irrelevant to Stellar Firma? But it's not relevant to this conversation, I think.

#### TIM

Ben, have you been watching the news and therefore the rise of fascism in the early 21st century?

#### BEN

Ooooh, satire.

#### TIM

Oh, it's very depressing!

#### BEN

Christ, yeah. It was by-election day today. Didn't go well.

#### TIM

It's gone poorly.

#### BEN

Yep.

#### TIM

Gone real poorly.

#### BRYN

So, moving swiftly on, I will-- As I explained, as my background being in physics and cosmology, it's not the only branch of science, much to my shock and disappointment.

#### TIM

What?

#### BRYN

And there are definitely bits of zoology and biology that could be discussed in relation to some of the outlandish claims made in Stellar Firma. And I'm just going to accept everything you've ever said about, y'know...

#### BEN

No, I think they're all pretty rigorously accurate.

#### TIM

I was-- I toured my original choice of universities with an idea that I was going to study zoology, at once point I got a 'U' in my biology A.S. level? And that really quickly fell off the map.

#### BEN

I remember us having to have the conversation of, 'Yes, Tim, but you are very bad at this.'

#### TIM

'It's probably not gonna happen.' Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, the thing is, I'm not bad at biology. I'm bad at exams. [__BEN:__ Yeah, no, you were bad at passing exams, which you need to do.] And unfortunately, they're very important for being allowed to study biology.

#### BRYN

Yep, yep, yep.

#### TIM

They don't take it on trust.

#### BEN

No.

#### BRYN

I haven't studied any biology for about twenty years, but I'm just going to assume that at the very least I can say there's a lot more leeway. It's a messier area.

#### TIM

It's a squishier topic.

#### BEN

I will just reassure you, Bryn, that every biological statement we've ever made in Stellar Firma has been peer reviewed by the journal *Nature.*

#### BRYN

Excellent, excellent.

#### TIM

Yes. We had a hotline.

#### BEN

Yeah.

#### BRYN

So, my first question is-- Very, very early on in episode 51, IMOGEN claims a specific value for the density that David 7 has achieved with his epic level workouts. [__TIM:__ Right.] Which of the two of can get closest to the value quoted by IMOGEN for what David's density is?

#### BEN

I don't even know what the unit of density is. Also, Tim wrote that line. So that's unfair.

#### TIM

I wrote that. I wrote that line. I looked it up, but I can't remember. I will have looked that up.

#### BEN

It's pre-researched.

#### TIM

I'll have looked up... a dense material, and used its value, but I couldn't even tell you what-- Could you tell us what unit of measurement density is measured in, as a start?

#### BEN

Yeah, I don't even know what that...

#### BRYN

I'm not gonna tell you. Let's see if we can work it out. So, what is density? How do you calculate density, do you know that?

#### BEN

Mass by volume.

#### BRYN

Yes. Mass divided by volume. Do you know what the standard--

#### BEN

One point to Ben!

#### TIM

No, no, no... no. We didn't-- We specifically said it's not fastest finger first.

#### BEN

I answered a question! I answered it, and it was right.

#### TIM

You were just talking about--

#### BRYN

We're not, we're not awarding points for small, tiny bits like that, Ben. The point goes for the overall answer.

#### BEN

Ah, just the calculation of density! Thanks, Bryn. Apparently that doesn't matter to science. We don't need density, it's just, you know--

#### BRYN

I think you'll find-- Well, you know, the principle in a GCSE level exam, quoting the formula is the first part of the answer.

#### BEN

Everyone's a spherical turkey in a vacuum, are we? Great.

#### BRYN

Absolutely.

#### TIM

Chickens, Ben. They're chickens, come on.

#### BRYN

So, what is the unit of mass?

#### TIM

Unit of mass...

#### BEN

I mean... kilograms.

#### BRYN

It is indeed kilograms. And what do you think is the unit of volume?

#### BEN

Bignesses.

#### TIM

Millilitres squared. Cubed. It's cubic volume, isn't it?

#### BRYN

It's cubic, yeah. Did you say-- What was the--

#### TIM

I think I said 'cubic millilietres.'

#### BRYN

So millilitres is already a measure of volume, so you do not need to cube it.

#### TIM

Oh, I see. Oh, I see!

#### BRYN

You're conflating two things.

#### TIM

It comes pre-cubed!

#### BEN

It does.

#### TIM

Cubic litres.

#### BRYN

Millilitres indeed does come pre-cubed.

#### TIM

Cuuuuubes. Cubes! It's the cubes. Just a plain old cube.

#### BEN

Cubic metres, right?

#### BRYN

It is indeed cubic metres. So--

#### TIM

Can metres not come pre-cubed? Ah, I've got loads of metres I need to cube ahead of a barbecue.

#### BRYN

So, the units of density are in fact kilograms per metre cubed.

#### BEN

Okay.

#### TIM

Okay, okay.

#### BEN

And they come together to become... kilometregrams.

#### TIM

Yes.

#### BEN

And that is the unit of density.

#### TIM

Now okay, so, so, kilograms in--

#### BEN

Wait, is the question now, 'What is the arbitrary number that Tim came up with'?

#### BRYN

Absolutely.

#### TIM

No, it absolutely wasn't an arbitrary number. __[Ben groans]__ I'm certain if you googled it, you would find the substance I was, which was, it'll be like, lead, or gold, or something like that.

#### BRYN

I think it might be very close to gold.

#### TIM

Yeah.

#### BRYN

I'd have to check my list of densities.

#### BEN

Okay.

#### TIM

So the measurement is, 'If you have a cubic metre of gold--'

#### BRYN

Which is quite a big lump of thing.

#### TIM

'It's a big old lump of gold. How many kilograms is it?'

#### BRYN

That would be a good way to guess the answer, yeah.

#### TIM

I'm gonna say five hundred kilograms.

#### BEN

I'm gonna say... a cubic metre of gold. Sixteen hundred.

#### TIM

No, it's gonna be-- Yeah.

#### BEN

You've already answered, mate!

#### TIM

I've already answered. I'm hoping you've overshot, but it's gonna be real heavy.

#### BEN

Yeah, I might have. Yeah, are we playing Price is Right rules?

#### BRYN

I'm afraid-- I am gonna award the point to Ben. Ben remembered the formula, I think Ben got slightly close with the units, and he did technically have the closer of the two answers.

#### TIM

Is it like, ten thousand?

#### BEN

The density quoted for David by IMOGEN in that episode is 21,450 kilograms per cubic metre.

#### BEN

I absolutely nailed it. Just completely. Just right bang on.

#### TIM

Yeah, you really-- Ben, well-deserved point. Well done. I hope you choke on it.

#### BEN

Wasn't that by a factor of... anything? Definitely not ten.

#### BRYN

So, indeed. I believe that is pretty close to gold, which one is one of the more dense metals. Do we have any idea about what the scale-- What do we think-- Do we know what any of the metals at the other end of the scale-- What the least dense metals are, and what sort of value they might have? If we think that gold, and therefore the top of the scale, is about 21,000, twenty one and a half thousand--

#### BEN

Aluminium's quite a light metal, I think. So that's probably on the lower end.

#### BRYN

It is reasonably light, aluminium.

#### TIM

Is tin an alloy? Tin's an alloy, but what's it an alloy of? 'Cause tin's very light.

#### BEN

Yeah. Bronze and... copper?

#### TIM

Copper. Copper's very--

#### BEN

No, no, no! Bronze is an alloy as well. It's copper and... Ah, thinking back to my crafting game-- No, bronze is copper and tin!

#### BRYN

I believe tin is an element.

#### TIM

Is tin an element?

#### BRYN

Yeah.

#### BEN

Yeah, no, sorry, bronze is copper and tin. That's why I got all--

#### TIM

I'm gonna go tin. Tin's gotta be one of the lightest metals.

#### BRYN

I'm afraid neither of those feature in the list of the lightest metals. The lightest metals are actually metals that float in water.

#### BEN

Oh, are they like cobalt? 'Cause cobalt's a metal.

#### TIM

Francium. Caesium. Is it things like that?

#### BRYN

Tim's gotten a lot closer there. Caesium is closer.

#### BEN

Ooh, californium.

#### BRYN

The lightest-- The least dense metal is, uh--

#### BEN

Sodium! Sodium!

#### BRYN

Almost, yeah. Sodium, I think, is second or third? The lightest metal as far as I could tell is lithium. Although it may be radium, but radium's a bit more complicated, so I'm gonna say it's lithium.

#### TIM

But sodium was pretty close. [__BRYN:__ It was very close.] It was closer than the factor that Ben was wrong when he got a point, just putting it out there.

#### BRYN

So if we take lithium as the least dense metal, what do we think the density of lithium might be, roughly?

#### TIM

So if it floats in water...

#### BEN

And we want a cubic metre.

#### BRYN

Effectively, yeah.

#### BEN

I guess if we choose the cubic metre as the thing...

#### BRYN

Now, it floating in water may be a slightly misleading thing. But...

#### TIM

Because... because iron ships float in water, 'cause that's due to displacement.

#### BRYN

Because of displacement-- Absolutely yeah.

#### BEN

So gold was about 20-- 'ish, 21,000, about. So the lightest one--

#### BRYN

And I believe a thousand almost exactly. It's just very conveniently happens to be close to a very round number.

#### BEN

I'm gonna say... eight hundred. For a cubic metre.

#### TIM

I'm gonna go a little under that. I'm gonna go... six hundred. I'm gonna go enough below that I'm not being like--

#### BEN

Yeah, no, no, you didn't say seven hundred and ninety nine, so I'm all good.

#### TIM

I don't wanna be that guy. So six hundred kilograms per cubic metre.

#### BRYN

Pretty good, pretty good. Point to Tim there, because that makes it-- Because the correct answer I believe is 530.

#### TIM

Ooh, pretty close.

#### BEN

I had 500 in my heart but I was like, 'That's ridiculous.'

#### TIM

Ah, you should've gone with your heart and painted with all the colours of the wind, Ben.

#### BRYN

So yeah, so the density of metals ranges from about 530, 500'ish, to about 22 and a half. So yeah, David's density, quite near the top of that range.

#### TIM

Pretty dang dense.

#### BRYN

A much tougher question: do you know what the densest metal is? It's quite an obscure one.

#### BEN

What that says is it's "not lead."

#### TIM

Can I ask a question?

#### BRYN

You can always ask extra questions, yeah, if you think it's gonna help.

#### TIM

So in terms of, uh, the periodic table, 'cause it's ordered by number of, oh gosh, is it protons and neutrons? It's number of protons and neutrons [__BRYN:__ Yes.] 'cause helium has one, hydrogen has two, so on.

#### BRYN

Exactly, yep.

#### TIM

So it's gonna be in the bottom right hand corner. I bet there's a special column for like noble gases and stuff which confuses things. So it's bottom right, excluding like two or three rows.

#### BEN

Oh, you said it was obscure. Oh, no, you said it was obscure.

#### BRYN

It's complicated, because the atomic number which is the key thing of the period table, is not the only thing which affects it. But it obviously a [__TIM:__ A factor.] a key factor.

#### TIM

Now, here's a follow-up. Is it one that exists in nature, or is it on that special bottom one of elements that can only be created in a lab and won't exist?

#### BRYN

I don't know.

#### TIM/BEN

Ohhh!

#### TIM

Do I get a point for stumping teacher?

#### BEN

At this point we're playing 'Guess Who' with the periodic table. I wanna call foul on this question. I don't think we should.

#### TIM

Does it have a mustache? No.

#### BEN

Yeah, exactly. Well, I'm actually gonna answer before this, so I'm gonna take--

#### BRYN

It's not, no no, it's naturally occurring. Okay, I wanted to check, because I wasn't certain, but it is-- I was right. It's naturally occurring, and it's not one of the really weird ones, actually. It's just a slightly obscure one.

#### BEN

I'm gonna say it's uranium. I think-- I'm gonna say uranium because I think nuclear metals, like radioactive metals, are very heavy, and that's kind of the problem with them is that they're too, they're too full of things, and they gotta ahhhh.

#### TIM

I'm gonna think of another radioactive metal. I'm gonna go plutonium.

#### BEN

Which would've been my other answer. I'm gonna be very annoyed if I, uh...

#### TIM

'Cause I think plutonium is more unstable than uranium. I think. But again, I'm gonna shock you here: I'm not a nuclear physicist.

#### BRYN

Plutonium is indeed slightly heavier and slightly more unstable than uranium.

#### TIM

Yess.

#### BRYN

It is, however, not naturally occurring in nature, and in fact the best way to get plutonium is to go through nuclear processes with uranium.

#### BEN

Ahhh.

#### BRYN

The answer to the question is osmium.

#### TIM

Osmium.

#### BRYN

Which is a metal most people haven't even heard of it.

#### TIM

From the land of Oz. Is it from Australia?

#### BRYN

And I'm not sure I had heard of it until I looked up the answer to this question.

#### BEN

I thought osmium was the cousin of Osmosis Jones, but...

#### TIM

Wow, that is a specific reference.

#### BEN

It's a fun-- Hey, Neil Patrick Harris is a pill. All-time great role. Wait, sorry, it's not Neil Patrick Harris, it's another guy with three names. It's David Hyde Pierce. I got bamboozled by his three names!

##### [Tim and Bryn laugh]

#### TIM

All potentially first names.

#### BEN

Hyde?

#### TIM

Well, I was thinking Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and then I saw the flaw in my argument. It's very specifically a surname.

#### BEN

Oh no, his name was Hyde Hyde. And Hyde Jekyll. It was very weird.

#### TIM

Related to Heidi Klum, but not in the way you'd exist.

#### BEN

Bryn, help. Are we having a closeness point, or was it a just an getting the right answer point?

#### BRYN

That was a getting the right answer point, and to be honest, I didn't expect either of you to know it. Because I didn't know it until I looked up the answer earlier, so, yeah. Osmium. [__TIM:__ Osmium.] Just random, hanging out in the periodic table, being super dense.

#### TIM

What's osmium for?

#### BEN

I'm just glad that my methodology wasn't wrong.

#### TIM

No, it was good. It guided me to my answer.

#### BRYN

These were sensible ways to make educated guesses, so well done to both of you there.

#### TIM

Because Bryn, every element has to be for something, because everything's for humans, what's osmium for?

#### BEN

Just vibin', man.

#### TIM

Just vibin'. It's just chilling.

#### BRYN

I think it's just quite a weird, quite an obscure element. I don't think we use it for much. I mean it is-- The denseness does make it pretty hard, and it's probably useful for that reason. But, my follow-up question is going to be: later on in the season, Trexel I believe tries to stab David with a knife.

#### TIM

Mmm.

#### BRYN

And at first he thinks it's a joke knife, 'cause of course it doesn't do any harm to David, and then he stabs himelf and hurts himself.

#### TIM

Yeah, in the leg, yeah.

#### BRYN

Now, is it realistic that if David is that dense, David has the density of a very dense metal, does it necessarily follow that he could not stabbed by a knife?

#### TIM

No.

#### BEN

No.

#### TIM

Because density doesn't mean hardness. Because you can be hard and brittle, you can be dense and soft.

#### BEN

And if the answer for 'what is the name of that scale,' if that is the question, I've been trying to think of that since we started recording, 'cause I had like a feeling that it might come up, and I cannot remember. But I can tell you what's top and bottom on it.

#### TIM

Ooh, go on then. Tops and bottom.

#### BEN

At the bottom is talc, and at the top is diamond.

#### TIM

And bottom talc and top diamonds are both things in their own right.

#### BEN

I'm pretty sure bottom talc and top diamonds are both stans from Jojo's Bizarre Adventure.

#### BRYN

I'm gonna give you both a point there. I'm happy with the information both of you provided.

#### TIM

Which in some ways is the same thing as neither of us getting points. Thanks, Bryn.

#### BRYN

Yes, so. Density and hardness are not necessarily related. They can be, and diamond is pretty dense for a non-metal, and osmium is quite hard, but osmium is both hard and brittle. So, because different forms of stress on material can cause different reactions.

#### TIM

And you can, you can take a-- I know what I'm about to say is not an element, but you can take a substance like steel, and if you quench it after heating it, it's very hard but very brittle. And it's still the same stuff.

#### BRYN

Absolutely. Absolutely.

#### TIM

It's the arrangement of the atoms. Are they lined up? Are they all over the place? Wibbly-wobbling in? I know very basic metallurgy.

#### BEN

He's trying to bamboozle you, Bryn. He's trying to extract another point.

#### TIM

Give me your points.

#### BRYN

Okay, I'm gonna hop on to episode 59. Which, actually, was one of my personal favourites of the series.

#### BEN

What happened? Was it good?

#### BRYN

Episode 59 was the one where Trexel kept giving useless rhyming puzzles.

#### TIM/BEN

Oh! The puzzle master!

#### TIM

Turn it twice, and turn again! Do not go! It is not your friend! Even past the goblins' lair -- oh, look! A fun little fair! The goblins set it up to con you out of your sweet anon.

#### BRYN

Absolutely.

#### BEN

God, they're just under the surface at any moment, like a great white that will burst forth and consume a child.

#### TIM

I'm just bubbling away.

#### BRYN

I enjoyed that episode immensely. It was glorious. Definitely one of my favourites. I think the use of the word 'squawkward' in a rhyming scheme was the thing that actually made me burst into tears with laughter.

#### TIM

If Keats had any bravery, he'd have done it.

#### BEN

Yep.

#### TIM

But he's a coward.

#### BRYN

But there was a single sentence in that episode which I'm going to choose to pick apart because it made me very angry.

#### BEN

Ahhh. The gamut of emotions.

#### BRYN

Which was the discussion of dry ice, and what dry ice might be. What did Trexel claim was dry ice?

#### TIM

Gosh, what did Trexel claim was dry ice? What did I claim was dry ice?

#### BEN

Ice, but you put it under a hair dryer or something. Where you hang it out. It's going to be a very literal interpretation of dry ice.

#### TIM

Yeah. Yeah, it's really cold sand.

#### BRYN

Trexel claimed that if you just take some ice and heat it up, you get dry ice.

#### BEN

Yep.

#### TIM

Correct. Science.

#### BRYN

And you could not be more wrong. I'm going to give a point to Ben there for correctly remembering the show you were both in.

#### TIM

If you heated dry ice, I'm guessing you would just get gas. 'Cause it's sort of trying to become gas really aggressively.

#### BRYN

Well, this is my question. What is dry ice?

#### BEN

Dry ice is... oh, god, what is it? It is-- Isn't it like dehydrated--

#### TIM

Water.

#### BEN

Oh, it's, um. It's dehydrated carbon dioxide. Or it's just carbon dioxide, I think.

#### BRYN

It is indeed carbon dioxide. I don't think dehydrated is the word you mean, because dehydrated means to 'have the water taken out of it.'

#### TIM

Condensed?

#### BEN

Yeah, it's frozen or something. Like it's, um, super-critical? No. That's a different thing. I'm just naming science terms now, Bryn. Help. Help.

#### BRYN

You are getting a bit word soup here.

#### TIM

Is it superliminal? Is it...

#### BRYN

It is solid carbon dioxide.

#### BEN

Ah, right, okay.

#### BRYN

So carbon dioxide in its natural form is a colourless, odourless gas.

#### TIM

Hm.

#### BRYN

But, when you freeze so it becomes solid, it is a kind of white chalky substance, and then because it's natural is a gas, it vaporises very easily, and then you kind of blow it into the air, and while it is transitioning between states, it has the appearance-- the smoky appearance that we associate. So, just a quick safety warning: don't use dry ice in a badly ventilated room. [__TIM:__ No, 'cause it replaces all the oxygen.] You do not want a lot of extra carbon dioxide in your room. Not healthy.

#### BEN

I was gonna say, that's why you can feel a bit lightheaded if there's a bit too much dry ice.

#### BRYN

So this brings me on to my next topic of questioning, which is the states of matter. Do we know our states of matter? And, one thing I'm not sure about, is I feel like I probably have asked this question before in one of the other science specials.

#### BEN

Neither of us will remember.

#### BRYN

There are five, or maybe six, states of matter.

#### BEN

Okay.

#### BRYN

How many of them can we name?

#### BEN

Well, it's solid liquid gas plasma, those are the easy ones.

#### BRYN

Yup.

#### TIM

And the other one.

#### BEN

They start to get names which start to sound--

#### TIM

Keith state.

#### BEN

I think they start to sound like, ridiculous. 'Cause I think one--

#### BRYN

The final two are slightly weird sounding.

#### BEN

Is one of them flux?

#### BRYN

No.

#### BEN

Okay, fine, fine.

#### TIM

Does one of them __[BLEEP]__?

#### BEN

Uhh... Mmm. Interesting.

#### TIM

The podcast won't hear that, 'cause they'll have had to bleep it out.

#### BEN

Yep.

#### TIM

Work it out from the rhyme, people!

#### BEN

I respect your commitment. It doesn't rhyme. It begins with the same letter, it doesn't rhyme.

#### TIM

It's assonance. I've watched *Educating Rita.* It's assonance.

#### BEN

Thanks, Michael Caine.

#### TIM

Or, I'm gonna teach you about knowin' yourself.

#### BEN

And I have bad opinions, because I'm an old man now.

#### TIM

I'm an old man. I don't know. I'm gonna hold up the flag. I don't know. And that's very brave of me to admit.

#### BEN

Piss off.

#### TIM

And deserves a point.

#### BEN

Ugh, there is-- and I think it's like-- Oh, oh, oh! Is one of them a superfluid?

#### BRYN

Yyyy....es. That's not the name of it, that's a description.

#### BEN

Aaah, okay, well. I don't know the name of it.

#### BRYN

Okay, the final two states of matter, the first, the one that we have observed, created in a lab, and can confirm actually exists, is called a Bose-Einstein condensate.

#### BEN

Okay, fair enough.

#### TIM

That was on the tip of my tongue.

#### BEN

Also, is the last one bloomin' dark matter or antimatter or something?

#### BRYN

No, the last one is a fermionic condensate.

#### BEN

Ah, yeah, no.

#### TIM

Aaah. Now. Is that old... En...rico... Fermi? Enrico?

#### BRYN/BEN

Yes.

#### TIM

Yes. Yes?

#### BEN

Yes?

#### BRYN

You're naming a scientist.

#### BEN

You named it.

#### TIM

You know what? Knowing the first name of scientists that have the things named after them is harder than you think. 'Cause it's never like, David Zellerman.

#### BEN

Yeah, and no one sits there and says Alfred Einstein.

#### TIM

No, they just Einstein. Simple. Quick.

#### BEN

Did I get that past Tim without him realising? Okay, okay. There is a point at which like I have to make it clear that I'm not an idiot, but also...

#### TIM

No, but like Heisenberg-- what's Heisenberg's first name? What's Fahrenheit's first name?

#### BEN

Oh, Fahrenheit's first name. Isn't it like...

#### TIM

Little Billy Fahrenheit?

#### BEN

It's like, Anton Fahrenheit or something. Wasn't he French or Italian?

#### TIM

But do I not have a slight point? Will you concede that, Ben?

#### BEN

Look, Tim. I was making a goof about the one scientist that everyone knows the name of. And I got the name on purpose, and then got worried that everyone think on Tumblr would roast me for not knowing Albrecht Einstein's name.

#### BRYN

Well done for knowing his first name, Tim. It's not worth a point, but it does make me happy.

#### TIM

Damn.

#### BRYN

Yes. So the Bose-Einstein condensate, and the fermionic condensate are very weird. 'Cause they are basically subatomic states of matter, produced-- Kind of elevated up into the microscopic level by keeping things very cold. And it's just weird, and it's not relevant to real life.

#### TIM

It's the stuff you're only gonna find it out in space, away from the all the good stuff.

#### BRYN

You can't even find it in space. You can only find it in a lab.

#### TIM

Not even in space!

#### BRYN

You have to make it yourself, basically.

#### BEN

Take that, space.

#### BRYN

Solid, liquid, gas, plasma, are the actual, helpful, useful ones. Very quick descriptions of each one. I imagine at least three of these are kind of a gimme.

#### TIM

Solid is... it doesn't flow. A solid doesn't flow.

#### BRYN

Excellent.

#### TIM

A gas expands to fill the shape of the vessel it's in...

#### BRYN

Very good.

#### TIM

And a liquid... fffff... fff... does... the third one.

#### BEN

I think a liquid can just flow. I think that's acceptable.

#### TIM

Yeah, liquids flow, and gasses also flow, but have other properties.

#### BRYN

Yep.

#### TIM

Such as expanding to fill the vessel they're in. And plasma is only, it's something like it's the transition, like you're never just staying as a plasma, you're transitioning? I can't remember.

#### BEN

I think it's a-- is a plasma a liquid beyond its boiling point. So it's like a [__TIM:__ That hasn't turned to gas.], it should be a gas, but it's kept in a liquid state because of pressure?

#### TIM

Social pressure. Social pressure.

#### BEN

Or it's just-- Either that or what I'm describing is a liquid, because it's under pressure.

#### BRYN

Yeah, that would still be a liquid, I'm afraid. 'Cause if you apply enough pressure, and then heat a liquid, but it's still a liquid, it's still liquid.

#### BEN

Oh, and that's how you make something go supercritical! We're dancing around the thing I think I know.

#### BRYN

Yeah.

#### TIM

Although you can't, you can't-- This is gonna sound thick-- You can't compress a liquid, can you? Liquids can't be compressed.

#### BRYN

Correct.

#### TIM

But compression is not the same-- A liquid is under pressure.

#### BRYN

Yes. Compression and pressure are different.

#### TIM

Yes, okay. I just wanted to make sure that that was the case.

#### BRYN

Obviously closely related, but you can separate them out.

#### BEN

But the big question is will it blend?

#### TIM

Will it blend? Will liquids blend? Almost always yes.

#### BRYN

Alright, so, a plasma is very hot, and very dense, and crucially: charged.

#### BEN

So the himbo of states of matter.

#### TIM

Yeah. Hot, dense, and expensive.

#### BRYN

So, one of the key things about a plasma is essentially, it is under such extreme conditions that the atoms within it have separated, so the nuclei and the electrons are no longer bound together, and they're both flowing.

#### BEN

That really blended.

#### TIM

Much like a pressurised marriage.

#### BRYN

So it is similar to a liquid in some ways, Ben, so you're right to compare as the most closely to a liquid.

#### BEN

I know it was like, yeah, when sci-fi is doing plasma, it's always like wibbly wobbly.

#### BRYN

Yeah, yeah. But it requires very extreme conditions of both heat and pressure to achieve it. And it's most commonly achieved in something like the sun.

#### TIM

So, so, I-- for some reason, I was under the impression that like, at a point inside a flame, you know, in a fire, that was something to do with plasma. Or is that just superheated gas?

#### BRYN

That is just hot gas, yeah. There's no plasma in the fire. You need really special conditions to achieve a plasma.

#### TIM

I mean, I've got a pretty efficient stove, Bryn. I'm pretty sure I could make plasma in it, thank you very much.

#### BRYN

You cannot, I can assure you of that. [__BEN:__ Agree to disagree. Agree to disagree.] I was about to give both of you a point for that little section, and now I'm not giving Tim one. So Ben, congratulations on your point.

#### BEN

Yes. Hubris.

#### TIM

Hubris.

#### BEN

Hubris.

#### TIM

Just because I'm really, really boastful about my range.

#### BEN

He's got an auger.

#### BRYN

My final question on this topic is: Do you know the name for the transitions between each of these states? So, again, we've thrown away the two crazy condensate states. We're gonna throw away plasma as well, 'cause it's complex and it requires such specialised conditions. The remaining three: the common, everyday, solid, liquid, gas.

#### BEN

It's boiling and melting.

#### BRYN

So, that is indeed one of them. So when a liquid turns into a solid, it's called melting. Do we know the names for all the other potential transitions between the three?

#### TIM

Evaporation from a liquid to a gas.

#### BRYN

Yep.

#### TIM

Condensation, gas to liquid.

#### BRYN

Correct.

#### BEN

Oh, he's quick. Okay, mm. At one point 'supercritical' is gonna be the correct answer.

#### TIM

It's gotta be.

#### BEN

I think you're right, in that like when it gets into like supercritical states, it transitions without going through like one of the middle ones. But I can't... I'm just... I'm very confused.

#### BRYN

Each transition is actually quite a slow process. So it takes energy to change the temperature of a substance, and then it takes energy to change a substance from one state into another. So, the supercritical description is essentially... you've already achieved that amount of energy being present, but you haven't yet changed the state, because you're artificially maintaining it.

#### TIM

Like when you super-chill water, and it takes kinetic energy to make it freeze. So you can put a bottle of water in the freeze, and take it out and it's still water, and hit it and it suddenly freezes. 'Cause it's supercritical.

#### BRYN

That is an example of a supercritical state.

#### BEN

Ahhh.

#### BRYN

So I think the one you're thinking of is the artificially maintained liquid that basically as soon you give it a release from the pressure, will instantly vaporise. Well as normally--

#### BEN

Right, so it's about speed.

#### BRYN

Normally, evaporation is slow because it has to draw in energy to achieve the change. [__BEN:__ Okay, so.] So what do we have? We have melting, evaporation, condensation.

#### BEN

So we need the--

#### BRYN

No, 'boiling' not the way to describe it.

#### BEN

Yeah, it's the other way. But a gas to solid, right?

#### BRYN

So, the names for the two that are-- the relationship between gas and solid are the hard ones, because they're much less common. Did we define the-- Well, we have, we've used it in conversation, the change from liquid to solid is known as freezing.

#### TIM

Yes.

#### BEN

Yeah, yeah.

#### BRYN

Tim has given us that one just by discussing the process, right.

#### TIM

I'm just always talking about freezing, you know. It just comes up.

#### BEN

He's a very cool guy.

#### BRYN

So, the two hard ones...

#### TIM

So, I don't think this is one, but I wanna know what it is. When you can like, precipitate something from a metal, or you could-- There's a thing a chemistry where it's like you're taking a precipitation. What is that?

#### BRYN

So, a precipitation is similar, because something is transitioning from a liquid to a solid, so you can also call that freezing. But, crucially, with precipitation, you've got a mix of lots of different chemicals within your liquid, and only one of them is turning into a solid. So you're precipitating out part of your mix.

#### TIM

I see. So when you-- Salt water you'd evaporate sodium out of H₂0.

#### BRYN

Absolutely, yeah. So, you know, there's lot of-- We're getting into chemistry, and there's lots of other words for other ways you can do this when you've got mixes of--

#### TIM

Back to Bunsen burners. It always comes back to Bunsen burners, you know that.

#### BRYN

Absolutely. That is science. A Bunsen burner is science.

#### TIM

That's just science. That's just science flame. I think the short answer is no, Bryn, we don't know. 'Cause Ben's making his Popeye face, but he's getting no facts.

#### BEN

No, I'm racking-- The brain is being racked, there are nothing in these racks, these racks are empty.

#### TIM

Have you put the brain on the wheel? Are you gonna break the brain on the wheel and see if that gets it?

#### BEN

Yep. I 'm gonna draw and quarter my brain.

#### BRYN

So, when a solid turns directly into a gas, it is known as sublimation.

#### BEN

Ahhh.

#### TIM

Oohh. Rings a bell.

#### BRYN

And it's very rare, but there are some that do it. The one that people may have encountered is iodine [i-o-deen] ... or iodine [i-o-dine]. I no longer know how to pronounce that word.

#### BEN

You've consumed too much American media.

#### BRYN

But it is solid in its natural state, and it very easily changes into a gas, and it can undergo sublimation even just generally at room temperature. And the reverse, I believe is called, I'm actually terrified of getting this wrong, 'cause this is the one you encounter least often, and I think it might be called deposition, and it's similar to condensation, except that it depositing a liquid out of a gas, it deposits--

#### BEN

It has to appear in court.

#### BRYN

--a solid out of a gas.

#### TIM

Ben, that was a better joke-- I was trying to think of a way to insert that joke, and I think Bryn moved past it too quickly. Well done.

#### BEN

I saw-- Yeah, I saw your brain going and I was like, we've got the same joke in our head and I'm gonna have to strike.

#### TIM

Whatever it says can be used in evidence!

#### BRYN

Well, I'm too worried about getting this wrong. No, deposition, okay, good. I had to check it again.

#### TIM

So is dry ice going through sublimation because it is solidified C0₂ and it's turning directly to a gas from a solid?

#### BRYN

Exactly, and that's why it was one of the questions in this section, because that was the originally inspiration for discussing the states of matter.

#### TIM

But we talked for so long that I sort of forgot. And thought I was making a clever connection, as opposed to "it was the point."

#### BRYN

Yep.

#### BEN

That makes sense. It's leaving a deposit. I don't get the sublimation. It's becoming sublime? It's some-- bloomin' scientist waxed lyrical.

#### BRYN

Uncommon words because it doesn't occur very often, but interesting that it's, you know, in some ways, potentially part of our everyday experience of science. Solid, liquid, and gases. Um, just gonna draw attention to the fact episode 71, it's claimed that science hides from Trexel, and I just wanna approve that message.

#### TIM

It won't return my calls.

#### BRYN

Okay, okay. So before we go onto the glory of gravity and space/time, of which-- Oh, god, I'm so excited to talk about. Space.

#### BEN

The final frontier.

#### BRYN

Absolutely. What do we know about space? Crucially. There's a lot of discussion in the season of Stellar Firma about potentially ejecting people into space.

#### TIM/BEN

Yes.

#### BRYN

If a human, or human'ish, in the case of Trexel and David 7, human'ish body is ejected into space without external protection, what four different things are likely to kill that person?

#### TIM

Coooold.

#### BRYN

Now obviously, some of them are quicker than others, so in actual fact, one of them will be the first cause of death. But there are four different potentially lethal things.

#### BEN

Tim's gone with cold, yeah.

#### TIM

I was gonna say the cold, the cold.

#### BEN

Suffocation? There's no oxygen, famously. Famously no oxygen.

#### BRYN

Yep, that's two. Yep.

#### TIM

All of your moisture will evaporate off of you because of the low pressure.

#### BEN

And decomp... is that decompression?

#### BRYN

That is indeed decompression. So, the...

#### BEN

Oh, and uh, radiation. You'll be killed by the radiation.

#### BRYN

Brilliant!

#### TIM

Depends where you are in space, surely.

#### BRYN

Interesting point.

#### TIM

If you're in really, really, really deep space--

#### BEN

No, no-- I think--

#### TIM

The background radiation's gonna be enough.

#### BEN

Yeah, because you're not protecting by an atmosphere, just the general background radiation. I mean, it's probably not gonna kill you-- It won't be the first thing that gets ya, but it's not good for you.

#### TIM

You'll suffocate before you get a tumour, certainly.

#### BEN

Yeah,

#### BRYN

Yes. So two of those four things are very much affected by where in space you are.

#### TIM

'Cause if you're near a sun, you're not gonna freeze to death, you're gonna burn to death.

#### BRYN

Well, indeed.

#### TIM

Well, you're not gonna burn to death, 'cause you can't burn without the oxygen-- You're gonna be too hot to live.

#### BRYN

Well, y-y...

#### BEN

Too hot to live.

#### TIM

Which is the name of my new album. Tim Meredith. Too Hot to Live.

#### BRYN

Too hot to live!

#### TIM

Too hot to live!

#### BRYN

Again, I'm--

#### BEN

And too cold to die.

#### BRYN

You-- Between the two of you, you got both of those things there, and you even brought up the caveat. I'm very impressed. I give you both two points for that.

#### TIM

I felt like I had more there. I felt like I had more.

#### BEN

You started-- You said words first, but we had this whole conversation.

#### TIM

Ben, that's how you got all your points last night, and you know.

#### BEN

That is not, that is not! We've had like, the Bryn Monroe holistic science experience.

#### TIM

Which is the name of Bryn's album.

#### BEN

Yeah.

#### BRYN

So, yeah, so. If you're out in very deep space, far away from any stars that a source of radiation and heat, the cold is worse, and the radiation is better.

#### BEN

And Kelvin just comes up and beats you to death a baseball bat.

#### TIM

Yeah. Just yelling the word 'naught.'

#### BRYN

Ah, that pesky Kelvin. He gets everywhere.

#### BEN

Just with a tiny like, 50s sci-fi jetpack and like a fishbowl on his head.

#### TIM

Have you seen that really, really bleak comic, Kelvin and Hobbes? It's about a completely frozen tiger.

#### BRYN

Yes, so. If you are pretty close to a star, the cold is not going to be a problem. You will in fact overheat. And that isn't due to the radiation. The radiation and the cold are sort of inverses of each other, because temperature in space is really a measure how much radiation there is, because temperature doesn't exist when you don't have a substance to measure the temperature of.

#### TIM

It's gotta be vibrating something to be hot.

#### BRYN

It's, there is-- You can measure temperature in other ways, and in fact we do, and therefore we can say that the temperature of space is actually 3 Kelvin, more or less.

#### TIM

'Cause there is some gas in space, it's just very, very, very, very thin. Is that correct?

#### BRYN

Y...yyyes.

#### TIM

I suppose where in space you are. If you're in space on a planet, there's gonna be loads, Tim. I retract my statement.

#### BRYN

No no no no. I wasn't planning to ask this question, but I think this is a good one. In interstellar space, if you take a cubic metre, how many molecules are you likely to find in that cubic metre, and what will they be?

#### BEN

Hydrogen, and...

#### BRYN

Correct.

#### TIM

Is it less than one?

#### BEN

_(crosstalk)_ There can't be less than one, otherwise there wouldn't--

#### TIM

_(crosstalk)_ Is it like statistically less than one? No no, but like, if it's like, over an area per cubic metre--

#### BEN

Oh, it's an average? Ahh, no, but molecules get everywhere, Tim. I don't think-- I mean you can say less than one if you think you're being clever.

#### TIM

Well, I'll say one, and you can guess, Ben, and we'll see who's right.

#### BEN

The thing is, it's a cubic metre, and molecules are very, very small.

#### TIM

Yeah.

#### BRYN

Molecules are very, very small.

#### BEN

Yeah, so I'm gonna say...

#### TIM

I'm just hoping that you overshoot it enough that I'm still correct.

#### BEN

I probably am. I probably am, 'cause I'm gonna say to the power of... So I'm gonna say...

#### TIM

You think loads.

#### BEN

I think-- no, I think very few, but relative to the number of molecules we're used to.

#### TIM

Sure. 'Cause there's absolutely buttloads.

#### BEN

There's just, there's just so many molecules all around us.

#### TIM

Mate, you won't believe how many molecules are around us.

#### BEN

Tim, I hate to inform you: you are made of molecules.

#### TIM

Ah, dang it.

#### BEN

Ten to the power of eight.

#### BRYN

I'm afraid Tim is a lot closer.

#### BEN

Ahh.

#### BRYN

In an average cubic metre of interstellar space, you will find... four molecules.

##### [Tim and Ben make surprised noises]

#### BEN

That's not very many!

#### TIM

I'm pleased with myself.

#### BRYN

That is not very many at all, is it?

#### BEN

No.

#### BRYN

No, I mean, it's pretty close to a true a vacuum.

#### BEN

Yeah.

#### TIM

Yeah.

#### BRYN

A true vacuum being zero. Now, Ben has correctly identified that some of those molecules will be hydrogen.

#### TIM

Some will be helium.

#### BRYN

And helium. So, yes, the four molecules between them will all be hydrogen and helium. What do we think the ratio is? Do we think it's three and one, or two and two? Do you think if it's three and one, which way?

#### BEN

I think it's three to one on hydrogen.

#### TIM

I think it's-- Hang on. 'Cause I think it's three heliums and one hydrogen.

#### BEN

Hydrogen three, helium one. Wolverhampton nil, Hull City two.

#### TIM

South at Cira, moderate to poor. I think it's because hydrogen is so reactive that it will want to become helium, but if there's three helium already, the one the hydrogen hasn't got anything to react with.

#### BEN

It's like nah mate.

#### TIM

That's my reasoning, because it's four, and they can't get out of the cube, so it has to stay at three to one.

#### BEN

Oh that's, yes, no, fair enough.

#### TIM

'Cause this is a cube on its own. We're not talking about space and you've taken a portion. You've got an isolated cube--

#### BEN

Cube of space.

#### TIM

A cube of space, with walls.

#### BEN

You went out with a fish tank and you closed the fish tank and you took it back it to Earth.

#### TIM

Yeah. So that's just maths, mate, and I can't be wrong, 'cause that's maths.

#### BEN

It is maths, he's got me there.

#### BRYN

I'm gonna give a point to Ben.

#### TIM

Dammit! Not maaaths.

#### BEN

Celebratory sip of wine?

#### BRYN

So. You did say one thing that was correct there. Which is hydrogen is very reactive, Tim. However, hydrogen in its natural state is already a molecule. It is H₂.

#### TIM

Ooooh.

#### BRYN

Two hydrogen molecules have reacted with each other.

#### TIM

I can't believe hydrogen did me like that.

#### BRYN

Helium is incredibly unreactive. So helium is just helium, but hydrogen is H₂. Both hydrogen and helium are the only two substances formed initially after the big bang. Everything else in the universe was formed in the core of stars in nuclear reactions. But hydrogen and helium, been there since the beginning, 'cause there the two simplest ones. Now, you correctly said hydrogen is very reaction, but it already has reacted. [__TIM:__ Yeah.] But also, in a meter cubed, you only have four molecules... even if they were four incredibly reactive molecules, the chance of any of them reacting with each other? Essentially zero.

#### BEN

Just zooming about feeling lonely.

#### BRYN

Because they are absolutely tiny, as Ben has correctly stated.

#### BEN

Thank you.

#### BRYN

And even if they're confined into that metre cubed, they could bounce around forever and never hit each other. I believe I would have to do some maths how likely--

#### TIM

They couldn't bounce around forever and hit each other, Bryn, very importantly.

#### BEN

Ooooh.

#### BRYN

Yes. Not in an infinite amount of time, but I believe it would take more than the current lifetime of the universe for them to have a good possibility of hitting each other.

#### TIM

I just like to "well, actually" you about the definition of forever.

#### BRYN

No, that's fair, that's fair.

#### BEN

Yeah, it's like a screensaver. It's like waiting for the little DVD thing to actually hit a corner perfectly. It'll never happen.

#### TIM

It'll never happen. It's not in the programming.

#### BRYN

Ah, that was fun. I'm glad we got there.

#### TIM

I'm glad you finally had fun on one of these episodes, Bryn. That's the first time he's had fun.

#### BRYN

Ah, that's not true. I love them, you know that.

#### BEN

One molecule of fun. Have we got to the fabled episode 62?

#### BRYN

We were still talking about space. We're still talking about the things that kill you in space, weren't we? And that's how we got into what's left there in space. So, yeah. Radiation is gonna kill you very slowly in most parts of space, and the only time it's gonna be anything like the most dangerous of the four things you will encounter is when you're quite close to a sun.

#### BEN

You'll get cooked.

#### BRYN

And essentially-- yes. You are burning to death, but it's radiation burns.

#### BEN

Aw, well, that's nice, that's good to know.

#### TIM

You said that as if it was like, "But don't worry, it's just radiation burns. The happiest burns of all."

#### BEN

Yeah.

#### BRYN

Well, I wanted to, 'cause-- Just now, Tim you said, "Well, you're burning to death, but you're not burning to death because there's no substance to burn you."

#### TIM

Yeah, yeah.

#### BRYN

Well, it, you know-- I wanted to accept that you are essentially correct.

#### TIM

It's closer to being microwaved.

#### BRYN

Essentially, yes. So, of the other three things, given that radiation is the slowest by a long way, which one do we think kills you first?

#### BEN

Decompression.

#### TIM

I'm gonna say no. I think weirdly you can be in a vacuum-- I think being in vacuum and being under no pressure is very unpleasant. It'll blind you because all the moisture will go out of your eyes and things like that, but your skin... is enough... to keep you from depressurising, I believe. I don't think...

#### BEN

I think you get an embolism pretty bloody quickly.

#### TIM

I think you'd suffocate first. I think we are surprisingly robust in some ways to that, because I think I listened to something about them trying to work out what would happen if there was a, you know, decompression or you were outside without a space suit or something.

#### BEN

Alright, well.

#### TIM

Have I remembered that correctly, Bryn?

#### BRYN

Point to Tim.

#### TIM

Yessssssssss.

#### BRYN

Yeah, so, the decompression-- It's slightly a trick question, because actually the thing that kills you is the combination of the pressure and the lack of oxygen.

#### BEN

Yeah, 'cause isn't it a thing of like, is it a thing that um-- If you were hypothetically wanting to survive in space, you'd want to empty your lungs, because if you tried to-- Because you'd pop if you tried to like-- [__TIM:__ Yeah.] So, effectively, if you tried to beat the suffocation, you'd die from the decompression. If you tried to beat the decompression, you'd die from the suffocation first.

#### BRYN

Well... almost. Uh, so, my understanding, and this section is gonna get very gross, we may have to content warn this section.

#### BEN

People dying in... hypothetical ways.

#### BRYN

Yeah, yeah. So, I mean, Tim is right about your eyes suffering terribly from that. But your skin would mostly keep you in tact, even though you'd essentially bruise everything. [__TIM:__ Yeah.] All the way through? Uh, in quite a nasty way. I believe that our current best guess, given that we have never conducted an experiment, and, you know, fingers crossed we never will, is that the vacuum would actually suck all the air out of your lungs very rapidly, and then the transfer of air between your blood and your lungs normally relies on there being air pressure within your lungs. And if you truly emptied your lungs, i.e. a vacuum, your lungs would in fact work the opposite way, and start to suck [__TIM:__ Out of your blood!] the oxygen out of your blood. Which is a sort of unpleasant.

#### BEN

An oxygen hoover.

#### TIM

Bryn. It's not sort of unpleasant. [__BRYN:__ Yes.] I think you're safe in safe in saying it's just straight up and down unpleasant.

#### BRYN

Yeah, sorry. That was classic British understatement.

#### TIM

"It's a little-- It's not great for you. Um, we will say that."

#### BEN

"It's a little bit-- I would describe what happens in your lungs as a bit of a kerfluffle."

#### BRYN

Yes. So, you in fact, you essentially die of lack of oxygen even quicker than you would, say, if you were trying to hold your breath underwater.

#### TIM

'Cause you'd still absorb a little bit of oxygen from the water.

#### BRYN

--because you are actively losing oxygen due to the interaction of the, yeah, due to the vacuum. And yes, our-- We used to think that people would pop, but we now believe, my understanding is that your skin is actually surprisingly good at not doing that in that situation. But as I've said: we've never really tested it.

#### TIM/BEN

No.

#### BRYN

And hopefully we never will.

#### TIM

Until tonight, ladies and gentlemen! Live and in front of you!

#### BEN

The ghost of Yuri Gagarin.

#### BRYN

Ah, ah, before, again: I'm hyping episode 62, 'cause I'm just so excited about it, but, one other question I want to ask: at the beginning of episode 66, we meet David, who is still counting squats.

#### BEN

Yes.

#### BRYN

From the end of the previous episodes.

#### BEN

Yeah.

#### BRYN

The previous episode, episode 65, ends with David counting one, two, three. The beginning of episode 66, David is counting: one million and one, one million and two--

#### BEN

Because I am nothing if not very basic.

#### TIM

That's a lot of squats per second.

#### BRYN

Well, this is my question. Given that David is performing one, _perhaps_ if we're very generous, two squats per second... has he counted accurately? So, firstly, my first question is gonna be--

#### BEN

Well, okay, the answer is no.

#### TIM

No. No.

#### BRYN

Yeah.

#### TIM

We've worked that one out. Because, like, a lifetime is a few million seconds. It's like, three or four-- No. Is it even that?

#### BEN

Or it's like-- that's ridiculous, Tim.

#### TIM

No, how many million second is like, eighty years?

#### BEN

Well, there's sixty seconds in a minute, and there's quite a few minutes in a.. you know.

#### TIM

Is there a lot of them?

#### BEN

Yeah.

#### BRYN

So this my question--

#### BEN

No, you can't, this is cruel. 'Cause you're asking both me and Tim to do mental math on machine which have calculators in them.

#### TIM

But we're not gonna use them.

#### BEN

I know we're not gonna not, but...

#### BRYN

How... How long is a million seconds? And if you want the advanced one: how long is a billion seconds?

#### TIM

A million seconds is...

#### BEN

Tim. Tim. Tim. We're going to have do this unpodcast-friendly silently, because if you describe your working you'll be helping me.

#### TIM

Yeah, okay.

#### BEN

So we should have a think, and get an answer, and then say go.

#### TIM

Right. Sixty. And then... sixty times...

#### BEN

Stop it!

#### TIM

'Cause that's what I'm gonna do, Ben. Because--

#### BEN

So there's... so there's... so how many seconds are there in a minute?

##### [Tim and Ben begin counting from one]

#### TIM

'Cause the thing is: large numbers, for most people, very quickly become meaningless. And for me especially. I've got a medical condition about how little I understand numbers.

#### BEN

Ahhhhh, are you dyscalculic?

#### TIM

It was part of the test.

#### BEN

Ah, son of a gun.

#### TIM

I'm covered.

#### BEN

There you go.

#### TIM

I can't do anything.

#### BEN

Actually, that does mean, that 'cause this is an exam, you do legally have to get extra time.

#### TIM

Yeah. That's true. But the thing is the extra time won't help me.

#### BEN

No.

#### TIM

I won't suddenly be like--

#### BRYN

Is this legally an exam? Am I a publicly accredited examining body?

#### BEN

Hang on a minute.

#### BRYN

Not to my knowledge.

#### BEN

So that means Tim gets to bring a laptop into an exam, which means he can use the calculator app on his computer, which is unfortunately for me.

#### TIM

I mean, I'll google, that'll be the easier thing to do.

#### BRYN

Tim, I think your estimation skills have shown to be pretty good so far this episode.

#### TIM

Oh, don't butter me up, Bryn.

#### BRYN

So I think go with your heart. [__TIM:__ Go with my gut.] Go with your gut, not your calculations.

#### TIM

Uh, a million seconds is... thirty years.

#### BEN

Okay. Uhh. Right. So.

#### TIM

Why the __[bleep]__ not, eh?

#### BEN

Three... hundred... hours. Wait. Yeah. Three hundred hours... is... wait, no, hang on. Hang on. I'm going back in the tank.

#### TIM

He needs this. He's had a really tough couple of weeks, and he needs this.

#### BEN

Oh, no, I'm being an idiot. Wait. No, I'm not being an idiot. Yeah, it's roughly three hundred hours, so... that is... let's say. Okay, I'm gonna say it's a hundred days, which is completely wrong, but I feel like is close enough.

#### BRYN

The correct answer is eleven and a half days.

#### TIM

Wow. So not thirty years then, eh.

#### BRYN

I'm gonna give Ben a point because three hundred hours is pretty good. Three hundred hours, twenty four hours in a day, ten days, 240...

#### BEN

I got that bit wrong. That was the bit I got wrong. Well, 'cause I did it through-- there's three thousand six hundred seconds in an hour, so I just went bomp bomp bomp bomp.

#### TIM

You may as well be making hissing noises as far as I'm concerned.

#### BRYN

So a million seconds is eleven and a half days. So, reversing that calculation, if David 7 was accomplishing about, you know, eleven and a half squats per second--

#### BEN

That's...

#### BRYN

Constantly... four twenty-four hours.

#### BEN

That's a lot.

#### BRYN

Maybe...

#### BEN

Also, was he doing squats, or was he doing, um, pushy-upsy-downsies? [__BRYN:__ That's a good question.] Which I think are press-ups. I think those are press-ups.

#### BRYN

I mean that...

#### TIM

It's difficult... He's got his own vernacular.

#### BRYN

Only you can answer that sort of thing.

#### BEN

I cannot. You know I cannot.

#### TIM

You know what? If I had a better memory, I should have had a better chance at that, because a question on Taskmaster "how old is Frank Skinner in seconds?" And it must have been like, not two million, but two hundred million.

#### BEN

Ahhh.

#### TIM

And I think that's where I got confused.

#### BRYN

Well, Tim. I'm gonna give you a point.

#### BEN

For watching Taskmaster?

#### BRYN

Because I asked two questions. I asked how long is a million seconds. The answer is eleven and a half days, and I'm taking Ben's answer of 300 hours to very close to that. You answered thirty years, which is pretty close to how long a billion seconds is.

#### TIM

Ahhh.

#### BRYN

I think it's something like 32, maybe 33? But if you're rounding, thirty years'ish is about a billion seconds.

#### TIM

In Frank's case, it was nearly two billion years-- No, it was just over two billion years, 'cause he's like sixty..

#### BEN

Do you mean seconds?

#### BRYN

Two billion years...

#### TIM

Sorry, two billion seconds.

#### BEN

Oh, no.

#### TIM

He's two billion years old.

#### BEN

Frank has existed since...

#### TIM

Did you know that Frank Skinner was there at the dawn of time?

#### BRYN

Ah, well, that's controversial. When would you say the dawn of time is, Tim?

#### BEN

See, Tim, you'll have noticed that I started to say something like that. Remember that I don't know--

#### TIM

Yeah, it's not that far back, 'cause it's not gonna be like 1980...

#### BEN

No, 'cause I think-- I can't remember how old the Earth is, but I think the Earth is around-about... the Earth is some billion years. Is it 5.6 billion years old? God, this might be-- Now, the trouble is I've been roped into now making wrong statements that I was specifically trying to avoid because the answer is 'I don't know.'

#### TIM

"Hey, Tim, let's not say things like 'for example'..."

#### BEN

I know! I'm a fool.

#### BRYN

5.6 billion years is our current guess for the age of the sun.

#### BEN

Oh! Oh. Okay. I think, okay! So that number was in there somewhere.

#### TIM

I mean, that is still very wrong if you've, if the question was "how old is the Earth," how old is the sun is a very wrong answer.

#### BEN

No no no no no! But at least that was a number that is relevant on an astronomical scale.

#### TIM

Ehh.

#### BRYN

How old do we think the Earth is, give or take?

#### BEN

Not 5.6 billion years, let me tell you.

#### TIM

Two...

#### BRYN

It's a bit younger than the sun, yes.

#### TIM

Two and a half billion years.

#### BEN

1.2 billion years.

#### BRYN

Four and a half billion years.

#### TIM

Aw, I was close, those, points for Tim.

#### BRYN

It's a lot closer to the Sun. The Earth has also been around for a while. How long has single-celled life been around?

#### BEN

Uh, 600 million years.

#### TIM

I think it's a bit more than that. I'm gonna go 800 million years.

#### BRYN

You are both way off. Single-celled life has been around approximately, to our best guess, four billion years.

#### TIM

Well, there you go!

#### BEN

Oh, not on Earth. Right. Wait. Or on Earth?

#### BRYN

It's not a lot younger than the Earth itself.

#### BEN

Sorry, I just said a sequence of very stupid things.

#### TIM

Well, you know, to be fair, Ben, we have discovered single-celled life on other planets, so if you found-- Have we? Have we done that, or have I imagined that?

#### BEN

I... think so?

#### TIM

I think we've discovered bacteria in some places.

#### BRYN

There is some evidence of it.

#### BEN

Yeah.

#### TIM

So there is a reasonable assumption that somewhere in the universe, that there is much older bacterial life. [__BRYN:__ Yeah.] I mean, there's, there's mathematical evidence that somewhere in the universe there is advanced life, so that's quite a broad statement from Tim.

#### BRYN

Yeah.

#### BEN

Ah, unless you deal with that cheeky Enrico Fermi and his ol' paradox.

#### BRYN

Hehe, yes. How long has multi-cellular life been around, to our best guess?

#### BEN

Oooh, multi-cellular. Um.

#### TIM

Is it similar to the ratio of how long cinemas and how long multi-screen cinemas have existed?

#### BEN

Ahh, yes.

#### TIM

If you take that as a ratio, that... 'cause, okay. I'm gonna say... I think it's gonna be remarkably, it took a remarkably long time for two cells to __[bleep]__. Sorry, I swore again. It's taken a remarkably long time for two cells--

#### BEN

That's, wait, hang on, no, sorry, just hang on a minute, do you--

#### BRYN

I think that's a very good way of putting the transition from single to multi-cellular life.

#### BEN

Yeah, I want you to-- So, just, two single-celled [__TIM:__ 'Well, hang on a minute, you look nice.'] organisms decided to get it down, and were like, mushed themselves into each other so hard.

#### TIM

Well there is, there is evidence that in a cell, things like the ribosome... is... is it the ribosome, or the energy factory is a bacteria, and it got inside something else, and became-- You know, so it's like, it was an individual thing that lived on its own, and then it got inside a cell, and then look, was like, 'It was great here.'

#### BEN

We have established on this podcast biology questions are all true. Whatever you say, it is true.

#### BRYN

That is the principle which we're working at, yes, so well done, Tim.

#### TIM

And I'm pretty sure it's not ribosomes, it's-- What's the thing that makes the power and the energy in a cell?

#### BEN

A nucleus?

#### BRYN

The mitochondria.

#### TIM

The mitochondria, I think. That sounds right. Bryn's smarter than me. I'm gonna trust Bryn. And if you're wrong, email Bryn.

#### BEN

Well, a biology point for Bryn. He's on the board. He's not actually been performing very well-- he's got no points so far, but he's got on so far.

#### TIM

One billion years.

#### BEN

I broadly agree with Tim on the time scaling thing, so I'm gonna say... 1.6 billion years, 'cause again, trying to be close but not [__TIM:__ Be a dick.] pisstakingly close.

#### BRYN

It is, our best guess currently, pretty close to one billion years. [__TIM:__ Yesss!] I am forced somehow to give a point to Tim for that section.

#### TIM

I love rules when they go in my favour.

#### BEN

Yeah. I should have said one point-- naught point nine nine billion years.

#### TIM

Yeah, recurring.

#### BRYN

Yeah.

#### BEN

Yeah.

#### BRYN

So yeah--

#### BEN

An hour off of Tim's answer.

#### BRYN

That's the age of various things. So, Frank Skinner, who is allegedly two billion years old--

#### TIM

Yeah yeah yeah yeah.

#### BRYN

Was or was not there at the dawn of time, depending on what you're calling the dawn of time.

#### TIM

Strangely, he doesn't count as multi-cellular life. That's just one very complex shape.

#### BEN

That they've painted a face on.

#### TIM

Yeah yeah yeah. I mean, after a while it was awkward having him around. [__BRYN:__ Outstanding.] So like, 'Let's make him a comedian, go on, three lines on a shirt.'

#### BRYN

I don't know if I have any questions about this one, but in episode 69--

#### BEN

Nice.

#### BRYN

Nice. David 7 crushes a wastepaper basket into a disc on his face.

#### BEN

Yes.

#### TIM

Yes.

#### BEN

Yes.

#### BRYN

And--

#### TIM

Did you just wanna say this out loud?

#### BEN

And when Trexel correctly points out that the side of his face isn't even flat--

#### TIM/BEN

Yeah.

#### BRYN

So-- Is it-- Someone-- I can't even remember who, says David scared it.

#### TIM

Scared it flat.

#### BRYN

I'm not-- I don't have any follow-up questions. I just feel it's worth bringing up in this Science Special.

#### BEN

Well, I think-- I feel like if David slapped that can hard enough and fast enough, it would turn into a disc, because it would effectively explode from the point on his face. So it's not moulded by the face, it's slapped off a single point, expands, and then if he takes it away--

#### TIM

No--

#### BRYN

But it wouldn't stay in a single piece in that case.

#### TIM

And also, when you say, it its--

#### BEN

Aaaa, no, no, sorry, we didn't say what this can was made of.

#### TIM

And also, Ben, and also Ben, you say it hits a point on his face-- all of the parts of it don't hit that point at the same time. It's a wastepaper basket. Like some bits of it are gonna hit it much sooner--

#### BEN

We didn't say how big it was! No one has ever established a scale for David.

#### TIM

Okay, if... If... Okay, let's say this. If the wastepaper basket [__BEN:__ Yep.] is the size of [__BEN:__ Of a thimble.] of one cell, then yes, because it hits the side of one cell, and flattens.

#### BEN

Have I not mentioned that David 7 is Galactus, the Planet Eater?

#### TIM

I see. I see.

#### BRYN

Never came up.

#### TIM

Never came up. Okay. Well, okay, Bryn, you've correctly pointed that out as a thing we said.

#### BRYN

Also, also, I mean, Jenny's not here, so I can't criticise Jenny for the things she has said.

#### TIM

Oh, you can. We will.

#### BEN

She did establish the foot thing.

#### BRYN

But, episode 60 features a Hartro line that something is a "cornucopia of sound projectile science."

#### BEN

No, that sounds reasonable.

#### TIM

What a phrase!

#### BRYN

That sentence made me sad. My notes literally say next to that quote, "What even are these words?" That was apparently my thought while listening to that bit.

#### TIM

What is this?

#### BRYN

Okay, so, I think we've decided-- I think we've covered enough there, and I've been talking nonstop about the glory of episode 62 that, in fact, we're gonna do a secret special bonus Tim and Ben do Special where the entire--

#### TIM

We're secret and special.

#### BEN

So secret we're putting it on the feed.

#### TIM

Yeah.

#### BRYN

Where the entire, entire episode will be about episode 62, and episode 62 alone. Um, so, I guess this contest to be continued, and we will only find out who wins when you guys step into the Thunderdome of black holes and space-time.

#### BEN

Ah, love it. It's like a rubber sheet, everyone. It's like a rubber sheet.

#### TIM

Like a rubber sheet made entirely of helpful lies.

#### BRYN

So, until then, thank you for joining us, and we hope to see you on the special super-secret bonus Tim and Ben do Science, uh, which will probably be quite soon.

#### EVERYONE

Byyyyeee!
