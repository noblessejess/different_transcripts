#### TIM

Hi there. This is Tim Meredith, co-creator and showrunner of Stellar Firma, and I also play Trexel Geistman on the show. I just wanted to take a moment to thank all of you for listening to the show so far. The response has been overwhelming, and all of us here at Rusty Quill are constantly surprised by the strength and support from the fan community. If you want to help us, you can leave us a written review on iTunes to let other people know how much you've enjoyed the show, and you can also help us by sharing your thoughts about Stellar Firma on Twitter using #StellarFirma or by talking about us on your social media platform of choice. We have very little budget here at Stellar Firma for marketing, so word of mouth from fans is the main way we can increase our audience and ensure that we get to keep making the show, so nothing you can do is too small and anything you can do is massively appreciated. Enjoy the show!

#### DAVID 

_(talking to themself)_ S-screen soup, um... darkness soup, um... David soup? Oh no. Um... uh... ch-chair soup. Quick soup. __[footsteps approach]__ Um-- *soup* soup!

__[door swooshes open]__

#### TREXEL

David! __[David yelps]__ David. David...

#### DAVID

I've been playing the soup game.

#### TREXEL

What's the soup game?

#### DAVID

It's a game you left me with.

#### TREXEL

Don't come to me with games, David! This is serious business!

#### DAVID

We were playing games.

#### TREXEL

No we weren't, David.

#### DAVID

Yesterday!

#### TREXEL

We were being creatives, David! Games aren't creative; games how you get to creativity. You're not a creative game player unless you've played the game creatively. Do you understand?

#### DAVID

The--

#### TREXEL

Exactly. Well, it's an important point, David, because I realised something yesterday.

#### DAVID

What's that, Trexel?

#### TREXEL

I was up all night drinking in the Cosmic Lounge, and you know what I realised?

#### DAVID

What's that, Trexel?

#### TREXEL

Creativity is a lie.

#### DAVID

Oh.

#### TREXEL

Nothing we did was of any worth, David. I was thinking about it. It was nothing! There was nothing there! _(gradually becoming upset)_ Pillows. Mattresses. We didn't even define the size of the planet, David! This is what happens when I have dreams, David. I heard part of one bit of a-- of a show on creativity, and I got-- I got overexcited, and I came here with games, and-- we came up with nothing David, and we have a review!

#### DAVID

Did you listen to the rest of the show?

#### TREXEL

Rest of what show?

#### DAVID

The show you watched. You could have rewatched it and actually taught yourself the lessons that the show impart--

#### TREXEL

I was in the Cosmic Lounge drinking heavily! I didn't have time to watch a show! I had my fists balled, shaking them at the-- at the sky, shouting, "Why?! Why can't I be creative!?"

#### DAVID

It's because you hadn't watched the show.

#### TREXEL

Well, I don't have time to watch the show, because I was upset about not watching the show-- David, are you trying to tie me up in a logical knot? Are you trying to make me into a present and then post me to a friend you don't like?

#### DAVID

No... I'm trying to make sure that we have enough time to build a planet, so that the review goes through and I don't get made into soup.

#### TREXEL

Well, I haven't been keeping track of the time, David. How much time do we have before we need to submit the planet?

#### DAVID

You know what? Roughly 20 minutes.

#### TREXEL

Well, it's always roughly 20 minutes! I don't know what you're worrying about, David! We've knocked it out of the park before, and I'm sure we can do it again. And if we don't, well, then someone's gonna die, there's two of us in the room and it's not gonna be me, so you know. Let's just-- let's just move on--

#### DAVID

I'm gonna press the button now, Trexel.

#### TREXEL

Okay, well, push the button then.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ Initiating.

#### DAVID

So we have this from...

#### TREXEL

Oh, God.

#### DAVID

Berthenoldimothy von Wittlesteinium VII of the--

#### TREXEL

I beg your pardon?

#### DAVID

Berthenoldimothy von Wittlesteinium VII.

#### TREXEL

...Right. Continue.

#### DAVID

--of the intergalactic It's-probably-not-a-good-idea-to-touch-that Club.

#### TREXEL

Oh God.

#### DAVID

They are the official club historian. They have offered us a bit of a prosaic one, um... "so you know whenever you see lava, you just want to touch it? Well, now you can swim in it." Um, the non-negotiable feature is, it must contain a minimum one (1) lava slide that covers the entire planet.

#### TREXEL

Right. So we have the ravings of an idiot--

#### DAVID

Uhhhh...

#### TREXEL

--as a suggestion today.

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ Sass detected. Security alerted.

#### DAVID

Well, they are the official club historian of the It's-probably-not-a-good-idea-to-touch-that Club, and they seem to have ordered a fantasy planet where they can, in fact, touch that.

#### TREXEL

Have you ever encountered--

#### DAVID

Trexel?

#### TREXEL

Yes?

#### DAVID

I have been locked in this room for the past two weeks. No, I have not encountered the It's-probably-not-a-good-idea-to-touch-that Club.

#### TREXEL

Let me finish my question.

#### DAVID

Yes, Trexel.

#### TREXEL

Have you ever encountered someone from the It's-probably-not-a-good-idea-to-touch-that Club?

#### DAVID 

__[long sigh]__ No, Trexel, I haven't encountered anyone from the It's-probably-not-a-good-idea-to-touch-that Club, because I've been stuck in this room for the last two weeks.

#### TREXEL

Okay, I just wanted to check, David. You're-- you're feeling tense. I'm feeling some tension from across there.

#### DAVID

Yes, because I might die tomorrow.

#### TREXEL

Well, we all might die tomorrow, David. Maybe I'll get my shuttle licence back and fly into the sun again.

#### DAVID 

_(high pitched)_ *I* am significantly more--

#### TREXEL

But! You haven't met one.

#### DAVID

No.

#### TREXEL

They are *weirdos*, David. They are danger seekers. They're-- they're-- they're-- threat loons! They just love to get into dangerous situations like being too close to a radioactive particle, or-- or throwing knives in the air and seeing if you can avoid catching them with your face. That's-- that's their thing.

#### DAVID

Okay. Maybe driving something into a sun?

#### TREXEL

Well, exactly! How can we please someone that-- that has such a-- such a confusing compass as the-- Although... Maybe, David, maybe you should *shut up* for a minute 'cause this could actually be fantastic!

#### DAVID

Very shut up.

#### TREXEL

If they want something that's dangerous, really dangerous-- a planet made of lava that they can go on and be dangerous on. Or-- what-- what do we normally struggle with, David? We make planets...

#### DAVID

That are bad.

#### TREXEL

That are bad! And dangerous!

#### DAVID 

_(realising)_ Oh...

#### TREXEL

Animals roaming around that you're killing with a gun and then reviving with another!

#### DAVID

Well, they did say that would work.

#### TREXEL

A planet made entirely of trash--you're gonna get tetanus! All of these things are up-- usually, David, *usually*-- an issue! [__DAVID:__ Okay.] But for these idiots, it's-- it's a-- it's a positive boon, David, a positive boon! This is exactly what we needed, David! A planet where we can't fail! We can't fail, David!

#### DAVID

Oh, good.

#### TREXEL

We can't fail!

#### DAVID

Can't fail.

#### TREXEL

So let's not fail together, David.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

You and I-- look at me. Look into my eye.

#### DAVID

Looking at you.

#### TREXEL

Look at it.

#### DAVID

Yes?

#### TREXEL

Now this is the most important planet you may have ever invented. Do you know why?

#### DAVID

Why?

#### TREXEL

Because, as with all planets, it could mean your death, so admittedly, a later planet? Also could be equally important. But we're here and now. Each--

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ But each successive planet is the most important. Yes, okay, I-- I see what you're saying there, Trexel.

#### TREXEL 

_(crosstalk)_ It's a linear time thing, David. It's a linear time thing. But right now, here and now?

#### DAVID

Yes?

#### TREXEL

You?

#### DAVID

Yes?

#### TREXEL

Me?

#### DAVID

Yes?

#### TREXEL

The chair?

#### DAVID

Yes?

#### TREXEL

The table?

#### DAVID

Yes?

#### TREXEL

The vacuum tube?

#### DAVID

Yes?

#### TREXEL

This clock?

#### DAVID

Yes?

#### TREXEL

It's all come down to this, David.

#### DAVID

Okay. Then let's design a planet.

#### TREXEL

How big should it be?

#### DAVID

Well, they want to have a lava slide that goes around the entire thing, so it can't be *too* big, otherwise that's a bit too ambitious. Also, the entire planet might be made of lava? Let's just double-check the brief. __[pause]__ Um... Oh, no, you just need some lava that you can swim in.

#### TREXEL

Excellent, excellent. Okay. Have you ever been to an intergalactic theme park, David? Have you ever been to an intergalactic theme park?

#### DAVID 

_(agitated)_ *No*, I haven't been to an intergalactic theme park, Trexel. I've been locked in this room for the last two weeks.

#### TREXEL

You're very boring, David! You need to get out more. I know you can't, but you need to. So at those places, it's all about the surface-level details. If you open one of those doors, you'll just see teenagers smoking, or perhaps some poorly maintained equipment. But you don't open the door, David. You just see the-- the wonder on show. And that is how we can make this planet cost-efficient! Dangerous! And looking great! So we just get a-- just get a-- let's get a standard A-1 orb. Just a standard A-1 orb, David!

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

Make it out of granite, I don't care. You know, bit of radon's gonna come out of that-- who-- who knows? I don't! It's dangerous. They won't care, they love danger!

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

So we get your standard granite orb. Maybe we don't even need a core in it, David. Maybe we don't even need a core. We just need one inch of lava across the *whole* thing. Because the thing about lava is, if you put your foot in it, you don't really worry about how deep it is because your foot's melted.

#### DAVID

Well, no, but I think their actual requirement is that you can touch the lava.

#### TREXEL

Oh, you can touch lava at any point, David! No one's stopping you from touching lava!

#### DAVID

I feel---

#### TREXEL

They haven't said what happens *after* you touch that lava.

#### DAVID

I really feel like the implication here is that their foot does not fall off after they step in the lava. There is actually a planet--

#### TREXEL

Oh, I'm-- I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Let me just think back-- let me just think back, David. Let me just-- let me just think back. Did-- did you say you'd met one of the I-don't-think-it's-a-good-idea-to-touch-that Club?

#### DAVID

No.

#### TREXEL

So-- so you haven't met them.

#### DAVID

No.

#### TREXEL

And I have.

#### DAVID

Apparently.

#### TREXEL

And I'm telling you--

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

--they love danger. If one of them falls over into lava and then it turns out it's just hot jam or something, they're gonna-- they're gonna feel cheated! They're gonna feel-- they want the dan-- They want the *edge*, David!

#### DAVID

Well, they've specifically said--

#### TREXEL

Nipple clamps!

#### DAVID

Well-- no, what?

#### TREXEL

They've all got nipple clamps under their clothes 'cause they *love* that edge of danger!

#### DAVID

I do not see how clamped or unclamped their nipples is relevant to this!

#### TREXEL

They put spiders in their shoes, David. Oh, are they poisonous? Who can say? Because they love danger, David.

#### DAVID

Okay but they have ask--

#### TREXEL

They have been taking out risky mortgages.

#### DAVID

No, they--

#### TREXEL

Risky mortgages, David! They haven't got any property to back it, because they love danger!

#### DAVID

Financial decisions aside, they have specifically asked for a planet in which you *can* swim in lava. Now, from that, I can only assume that the objective is for this person to swim in lava, and if they die, then that's only a one-use item.

#### TREXEL

Look, when you assume you make an ass because you're an ass, David, but if you want to be an ass, be an ass! Fine, okay. We're gonna make "safe" lava. How do you propose we make safe--

#### DAVID

Well, no, I wasn't thinking about making--

#### TREXEL

No, no, no, no, David! No, no, no! Don't let-- don't let me *derail* you, Captain Fantastic over there, with your-- with your hat of ideas and-- Or why don't you just toot that little horn of-- Oh, you've got an idea. Oh, you're-- you're smoking a cigar of fun, aren't you, David? Well look at me, and look at you, and just-- go on, fine! Go on! I've-- I've got lost, David. What were we talking about? We're making safe lava!

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

How do we do it?

#### DAVID

Well, you were talking about a theme park.

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

Right?

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

Now, I'm aware that there is a variant of a theme park known as a "water park", where the ride *is* the water.

#### TREXEL

I see you've been looking up things on IMOGEN again.

#### DAVID

Yes. That is the only outlet I have apart from naming soup. So, you have a water park...

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

Right? Well, usually it *is* a good idea to touch that water, and that's not what the client wants. So let's make them a *lava* park.

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### DAVID

At that point, you create a _(punctuated)_ *pleasure* planet which is a global lava park...

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

There is the single big ride, [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] the slide, which goes around the entire planet, as they've asked--

#### TREXEL

The Lavatron.

#### DAVID

The Lavatron. Absolutely. We can call that maybe the Ultra Lavatron.

#### TREXEL

Ooh!

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ Ultra Lavatron trademarked.

#### DAVID

Mm! Don't you want to swim in it?

#### TREXEL

I do! And I know that lava's dang--

#### DAVID 

_(crosstalk)_ You shouldn't, it's made of lava.

#### TREXEL

It's made of lava. I shouldn't do it.

#### DAVID

No, you shouldn't. However! Maybe-- maybe you're right, actually. Maybe-- maybe-- You say you've met these people, so maybe some of them will want to swim in the lava without any protective gear and burn up and die.

#### TREXEL

Okay. Okay.

#### DAVID

That's their choice.

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

So, what we do is we provide, like if you go to an, um... Oh, what was it... Where-- Uh, the-- the ball alley, they give you those special shoes.

#### TREXEL

The bowling alley?

#### DAVID

A bowling alley. Yes, okay. So, well, you know, I've been looking at a lot of things. They give you those special shoes so you don't fall over.

#### TREXEL

Yes!

#### DAVID

Or do fall over? I'm not sure what the point of the shoes is but they--

#### TREXEL 

_(crosstalk)_ I just put them on. I don't ask questions, I just put them on and then worry I don't get a foot infection.

#### DAVID

Exactly. So this is how you don't get a lava infection. We give you fully covering--

#### TREXEL

Yes?

#### DAVID

--thermal suits!

#### TREXEL

Right.

#### DAVID

Up to you if you wear them, or how much of it you wear, so if you want to burn your face off then you--

#### TREXEL

Yeah. Just put the trousers on!

#### DAVID

--just put the trousers on.

#### TREXEL

You want-- you wanna get burnt nethers? Put on the top.

#### DAVID

Exactly. Actually--

#### TREXEL

Crispy bottom, smooth marshmallowy top. You're like a meringue.

#### DAVID

Yes. We could also have maybe some sort of thermal chaps if you want to specifically cook your chaps...

#### TREXEL

Just-- just the butt region.

#### DAVID

Yep.

#### TREXEL

Butt and thigh.

#### DAVID

Exactly.

#### TREXEL

Like a good chicken.

#### DAVID

So maybe you could also market it to other people as an extreme tanning salon.

#### TREXEL

David, you've actually come up with a great idea there. We don't have to worry about making the lava safe, because, _(laughing)_ David, you don't have to have me tell you lava isn't safe.

#### DAVID

I looked it up on IMOGEN. It's not.

#### TREXEL

Yes. Yes, I've been to many a birthday party where that fact has __[chuckles]__ been *very* important. So we just make regular, *regular* old lava-- you know what? In fact, it's often easier to have a planet covered in lava than not because if you don't balance things right, BAM. You turn around, you turn back, lava. Lava everywhere.

#### DAVID

Okay. Well, there we go.

#### TREXEL

All the lovely trees you made are on fire. All the animals are burnt to a crisp. Delicious, yes, but not what you wanted. So we just have regular lava, but we provide protection. If you want the protection, you can have it! If you're a real weirdo and you don't, you don't have to have it! Who can say? You sign a disclaimer, Stellar Firma Ltd. isn't-- is not culpable in any way. It's-- it's perfect, David! It's perfect!

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ Culpability deflected.

#### TREXEL

But! But how are we going to have a-- a-- a park of lava where-- where it doesn't just melt everything? You put-- you put lava in like, a metal slide? That metal slide's gonna get hot and melt!

#### DAVID

Well, you mentioned--

#### TREXEL

You put it on stone, the stone explodes! That's how volcanoes work.

#### DAVID

Okay, but--

#### TREXEL

I don't want to be a Problem Percy, but lava is real difficult to contain, David. Normally, what you have on lava is just more lava and it just keeps going down.

#### DAVID

Okay. Well, Percy, what we're going to have here--

#### TREXEL

You don't *ever* call me Percy. I am Trexel _(shouting)_ *Geistman!*

#### DAVID

Yes, Trexel.

#### TREXEL

I'm a Problem Trexel.

#### DAVID

Okay, Problem Trexel--

#### TREXEL

_(offended)_ *What* did you call me?

#### DAVID

I called you Trexel Geistman.

#### TREXEL

*Thank* you.

#### DAVID

Um... maybe we could contain the lava in some sort of anti-gravity array.

#### TREXEL

Ooh!

#### DAVID

If the lava doesn't actually touch anything, then it can't melt anything.

#### TREXEL

Yes! Yes!

#### DAVID

I mean, the air around it is still gonna be superheated but--

#### TREXEL

Sure!

#### DAVID

--that's the point of the suits.

#### TREXEL

LavLev!

#### DAVID

LavLev?

#### TREXEL

A LavLev system!

#### DAVID

A LavLev system.

#### TREXEL

LavLev!

#### DAVID

Yes, a LavLev slide.

#### TREXEL

Hey, want to keep your lava safe today? LavLev!

#### DAVID

LavLev.

#### TREXEL

LavLev!

#### DAVID

LavLev?

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ LavLev trademarked.

#### TREXEL

Wonderful, yes, okay! Yes, okay. So we'll have-- we'll have our standard A-1 orb, uh, it'll be of a-- of a medium size and we'll install across the service a LavLev system. [__DAVID:__ Mm-hmm.] So it may be a foot, two feet __[stammers]__ of air space, just to keep things just-- just-- just cool enough not to melt everything. On top, another foot and a half of lava, say. And that just means it's nice and cost-effective, and, you know, everything's there. Everything's what you want. It's all really hot, but you are able to get protective gear, and that means you're gonna have a safe, lovely trip! [__DAVID:__ Yeah.] Wonderful, David! This could work. This could work. Okay, anything else in the brief that we haven't considered yet?

#### DAVID

Um-- well, let's have a look. Um, so we've got that minimum one (1) lava slide that covers the entire planet...

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

But that's the Ultra Lavatron.

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

Maybe we could think about that. Other than that, no. Really, they just wanted a planet where you could swim in lava.

#### TREXEL

Okay. One consideration: hot ladders.

#### DAVID

Hot ladders?

#### TREXEL

Hot ladders. If you're on-- you're on the Ultra Lavatron. It's, uh-- what-- what-- what would it be, a tower?

#### DAVID

Mm?

#### TREXEL

You know? Standing 30, 40 feet tall? You know, we have a slide with-- fitted with the LavLev technology...

#### DAVID

Mm-hmm.

#### TREXEL

That ladder getting up there? [__DAVID:__ Mm?] It's going to be pretty hot. Yes, if you're wearing the protective gear, sure, but if you're one of the thrill-seekers, you're gonna lose all your skin on the way up.

#### DAVID

Well... what if you didn't climb up, but you dropped... down?

#### TREXEL

Down?

#### DAVID

You're a thrill seeker.

#### TREXEL

Yes?

#### DAVID

What's better than being dropped from orbit--

#### TREXEL

Ooh...

#### DAVID

--onto a slide full of lava?

#### TREXEL

Ooh, David. *Quelle surprise!* David! I like this! I like this! And this saves a lot of wear and tear on grounds and installations! I was thinking, you know, we'd have to have a, you know, maybe like-- maybe like a park and ride, or-- or a causeway, or restaurant facilities-- You know, they're all gonna have to be LavLev technologies protected, but don't bother with all of that! Don't bother with it all; you just need a shuttle in orbit!

#### DAVID

Mm-hmm.

#### TREXEL

All the facilities are on there! Restaurant, dining area, lido, playpen, ball pit...

#### DAVID

Burns unit.

#### TREXEL

Burns unit. It's all there! Loads of cream! Just, like, loads of cream! As much cream as there is food, really! And then that there, that can be the facility, and then if you want to get on the planet, you-- you get in a-- you get in a pod, shoots you down. If you're in protective gear, you'll come back later. If you didn't, well, that's your choice!

#### DAVID

Exactly. And so-- and depending on which tube you get into, in-- in the shuttle, that fires you at a different ride.

#### TREXEL

Yes!

#### DAVID

We've already got the Ultra Lavatron, um, which is the globally spanning lava slide, but what else do we have in lava parks? What are the other attractions?

#### TREXEL

Hmm. Gift shops.

#### DAVID

So we get--

#### TREXEL

Buy some lava. Take some lava home.

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ Okay, so we fire you into a shop?

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

With buckets of lava?

#### TREXEL

With just buckets of lava.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

Or, give you a bucket, write "gift shop" on the bucket. As you go down, scoop up some lava--

#### DAVID

Ooh!

#### TREXEL

--Bob's your uncle, that's a gift!

#### DAVID

So it just fires you into a big pool of lava, and it's up to you to get the bucket out.

#### TREXEL

Look, that's kind of the theme of the planet, David--

#### DAVID

No, I'm not saying-- I'm not saying that's bad!

#### TREXEL

You get fired in.

#### DAVID

I'm just clarifying!

#### TREXEL

Yeah, we're just gonna get some buckets and write "gift shop" on them. [__DAVID:__ Yeah.] Now, these buckets are gonna have to have LavLev technology in them because, as I say, [__DAVID:__ Yeah.] you get-- you get a standard bucket and scoop up some lava? My friend, you're just holding a hot handle.

#### DAVID

Yes. Well, then we'll get some nice LavLev buckets--

#### TREXEL

Excellent.

#### DAVID

--which will assumedly be invisible?

#### TREXEL

No, no, no, no. No, what I mean is-- you have a-- you have a bucket, and you just coat the *inside* with this LavLev technology.

#### DAVID

Well, what happens when the bucket is immersed in the lava in order to get the lava out?

#### TREXEL

Well, you put it on the outside as well. It's just covered in it.

#### DAVID

So, a fully LavLev'd bucket.

#### TREXEL

Yeah, if you dropped it in there, just like a foot-- well, hang a minute, that means if you dip it in, like, the lava is gonna run away as you go?

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Ahh, this is tricky. This is tricky.

#### DAVID

Unless-- unless you can develop some sort of-- Actually, I feel like this is a problem for the Build Team.

#### TREXEL

You know what? You're right. Build Team, you've got a task. Make a bucket that is a bucket, can contain lava but doesn't melt as you dip it into lava but doesn't propel that lava away such as that you cannot get lava into the bucket.

#### DAVID

Very important that it retains the basic functionality of a bucket.

#### TREXEL

Now, I'm no Build Team, but I-- I think we're gonna come back with some sort of ladle.

#### DAVID

Oooohh... But lava--

#### TREXEL

It could be a ladle. I don't-- I don't want to go-- I don't want to-- I don't want to step on anyone's creative toes...

#### DAVID

But maybe a--

#### TREXEL

Maybe a ladle!

#### DAVID

--LavLev ladle?

#### TREXEL

Because then, you've got that long bit, that long sort of straight bit, [__DAVID:__ Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.] and that can-- but then the scoop underneath, [__DAVID:__ Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.] so you can go down past the foot [__DAVID:__ Oh yeah.] where it falls over into the top. [__DAVID:__ Ahh.] I mean-- there's gonna be a lot of hovering lava in the-- in the shuttle, so we're gonna have to have pretty, pretty good fire safety protocols--

#### DAVID

Well, we've got the burns unit.

#### TREXEL

You've got the burns unit! *So* much cream.

#### DAVID

Actually to be honest--

#### TREXEL

Ohh, so much cream!

#### DAVID

Sounds like-- Build Team? Don't worry about it. Trexel's already designed it.

#### TREXEL

Yeah. It's just a ladle.

#### DAVID and TREXEL

A LavLev Ladle.

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ Roleplay holovision initiated.

##### [electronic powering on sound]

##### [Stellar Firma Ltd. theme playing in background]

#### TREXEL

Yes! Dip it in, scoop it out. You've got some lava, there's no doubt. _(singing)_ ♪ LavLev Ladle for the family... __[David singing LavLev ladle' in the background]__ LavLev Ladle, give one to your mum! 20 million credit units, don't refund me ever. ♫

##### [music ends]

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ Roleplay holovision terminated.

##### [electronic powering off sound]

#### DAVID

There you go!A little bit of a money-making thing on the side!

#### TREXEL

Yes, it's nice. It's nice. Wonderful! Good stuff, David. Good stuff. Okay, um, um--

#### DAVID

Well, so that's two things. We've got the Ultra Lavatron, and the lava gift shop, [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] where you're fired into a puddle of lava.

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

What about-- What else-- what else are in water parks?

#### TREXEL

We need something for the kids!

#### DAVID

Something the kids?

#### TREXEL

Something for the kids!

#### DAVID

Ummmm... a mascot?

#### TREXEL 

_(crosstalk)_ Some of their parents have recently died, so they need-- they need this pep up-- pep up.

#### DAVID

A lava mascot? [__TREXEL:__ Hmm.] Uh... Volcano, the happy volcano!

#### TREXEL

Yes!

#### DAVID

Dance as he squirts hot lava from his head!

#### TREXEL

Ooh. Um... for the kids?

#### DAVID

For the kids!

#### TREXEL

Is this gonna be on the shuttle or on the surface of the planet? [__DAVID:__ Um--] If it's in the shuttle, David, and they're squirting hot lava out of his head--

#### DAVID

Okay, you get fired into the crèche, the lava crèche.

#### TREXEL

Yes! A fenced-off area and we just fill it with hot jam.

#### DAVID

Ohh, there we go!

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ You know, not actually lava, but they're kids, David! They don't know.

#### DAVID

They don't care.

#### TREXEL

It's pretty warm j-- they're not gonna-- they're not gonna need any cream from the burns unit. It's just an area full of pretty warm jam. They're like, "Oh look, the floor's made of lava!" and we're like, "Heh, idiot, the floor's made of jam. The lava's on the *other* side of that fence."

#### DAVID

Well, hmm-- hang on a minute, we say jam.

#### TREXEL

Yes?

#### DAVID

What type of jam are we thinking? Because what colour is lava, usually?

#### TREXEL

It's normally orange!

#### DAVID

Exactly. So what about hot *marmalade*?

#### TREXEL

Yes, yes, yes! Why-- why blow our budget on jam, expensive, pricey jam, when we could just get some cheap marmalade, [__DAVID:__ Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.] and nobody's gonna know the difference? Those are children, David. They're idiots!

#### DAVID

They find-- they find the bits.

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

Just bits of rock.

#### TREXEL

Bits of rock! Bits of tasty, orange peel-looking rock!

#### DAVID

Well, they're gonna get it in their mouths, so jam or marmalade, they're gonna work out it's sugar eventually.

#### TREXEL

Yes, and then-- but then they're gonna go away thinking, "mmm, lava's tasty". But as long as they're off the planet, not our problem!

#### DAVID

And also, if they are the children of members of the It's-probably-not-a-good-idea-to-touch-that Club... fine!

#### TREXEL

Okay, wonderful. One final thing, David, one final thing. I think it's important to think of.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

The customer. You said they were the historian.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

We need some sort of nod or some sort of facility that talks about the history of the club. The history of the society. And I've got just the idea

#### DAVID

Mm?

#### TREXEL

A consistently collapsing barn of memories.

#### DAVID

Oh!

#### TREXEL

Because it's not a good idea to touch anything in a museum *or* in a barn that's on fire.

#### DAVID

Ah!

#### TREXEL

So, we put-- we put a history barn out on the-- out on the lava, we give it enough LavLev production to stop it from immediately disintegrating, but it is consistently catching fire.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

So they go in there and they're like, "Ah, remember that time we-- we swam with all those knives? It wasn't a good idea to touch that. Oh, look over there, a-- a-- a-- a collage depicting that time that we-- we suffocated ourselves in the vacuum of space. It wasn't a good idea to touch that vacuum of space. Oh, also, look, a chair. Oh, it's on fire! [__DAVID:__ Oh!] It wasn't a good idea to sit on that chair!"

#### DAVID

"We're in-- we're in a place where it's not a good idea to touch! How droll."

#### TREXEL

It's-- it's all-- "How droll!" And they'll laugh and laugh and burn and laugh, and then the survivors will tell their friends, and that's just more business for old Trexel Geistman and old David 7.

#### DAVID

I'm quite new.

#### TREXEL

Old David 7. Old two-week-old David 7.

#### DAVID

Well, I guess for a David I'm old.

#### TREXEL

Pretty old! Other Davids? Two, three days? Normally-- normally the first review.

#### DAVID 

_(crosstalk, muttering)_ From what I know about your track record...

#### TREXEL

Look, I am a professional, David. I wouldn't let you down. I've never-- When have I ever let you down, David? Don't answer that question, just look angrily at me, David. That's fine. Because anger is energy, energy is talent, and talent is a horse, and a horse is a dog. And *dogs* are--

#### DAVID

Trexel.

#### TREXEL

Sorry, what?

#### DAVID

Trexel, come back.

#### TREXEL

Sorry.

#### DAVID

Right. Well, I think we're just about out of time, so I'm gonna wrap this up--

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

--pop it in the chute.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Would you like to submit?

#### DAVID

Anything else you want to add?

#### TREXEL

No, too late! Pop it in the chute!

#### DAVID 

_(crosstalk)_ Right, gone!

#### IMOGEN

__[chime, pneumatic tube hissing]__ Submitting.

#### DAVID

Right. So, it's the review tomorrow.

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

Right?

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

And me and... Howl...?

#### TREXEL

Har. Tro.

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ Hartro.

#### TREXEL

Piltz!

#### DAVID

Hartro... are going to be sitting here [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] at the start of the shift.

#### TREXEL

Absolutely!

#### DAVID 

_(tentatively)_ And hopefully you will also be here?

#### TREXEL

100%-- David, I have put an alarm... in my office.

#### DAVID

Yes. This is your office.

#### TREXEL

No, this is the consultation room.

#### DAVID

What?

#### TREXEL

__[soft chuckle]__ You thought *this* was my office?

#### DAVID

Well... yes.

#### TREXEL

I have loads of offices, David. This is just one I keep Davids in.

#### DAVID

Okay. Well, which office is the alarm in?

#### TREXEL

The office I sleep in. The bed office.

#### DAVID

Isn't that just a bed*room*?

#### TREXEL

Does *your* bedroom have an angry picture of your father on the wall?

#### DAVID

Uhhhhhhhhhhhh... I mean, you're in it a lot.

#### TREXEL

Well I'm not your fa-- Oh, maybe I *am* your father.

#### DAVID

Well, I think--

#### TREXEL

I suppose in a very real sense, I am your father.

#### DAVID

No, I think--

#### TREXEL

Do you want to start calling me dad, David?

#### DAVID

No, I do not, Trexel.

#### TREXEL

Come on, son!

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ I think-- I think really, technically, IMOGEN is my father--

#### TREXEL

__[paper crinkling]__ Let's play catch with this balled-up piece of paper. Here you go, catch it! __[smack, paper falls to the floor]__ Ah, it's just bounced off your face, David. You'll catch the hang of it later. Don't worry! __[David gives a long-suffering sigh]__ What were you saying?

#### DAVID

Okay, so you've put an alarm--

#### TREXEL

Yes!

#### DAVID

--in your bed office--

#### TREXEL

Yes!

#### DAVID

--with an angry picture of your father on the wall?

#### TREXEL

Yes!

#### DAVID

Are you *sure* that's going to wake you up in time to get here so we can have a proper review with Hartro so that I don't die, and more importantly to you, your career continues to improve?

#### TREXEL

David, I've turned over... a new leaf.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

I'm getting up straight away in the morning. And then going for a quick round of space croquet.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

Then just one quick drink in the croquet clubhouse. And then obviously I need to say hello at Harry at the Cosmic Lounge.

#### DAVID

Yeah...

#### TREXEL

And you know, me and Harry, we get on! Maybe I can bring him sometime next week and you can meet him! And you know, we're just gonna have one or two drinks, and then yes, we do have a show to go to--

#### DAVID

Wh--

#### TREXEL

But it's the Roneys, and they're doing their new song, so we're going to go see the Roneys.

#### DAVID

*Trexel*.

#### TREXEL

And they're gonna-- and then obviously, after that, we have a dinner booked, and then I'll be straight along! I'll be straight along, David!

#### DAVID

You booked--

#### TREXEL

I'll bring you back some shrimp! Bye, David!

#### DAVID

You b--

##### [door swooshes closed]

#### DAVID 

_(talking to themself)_ He booked a show. That's-- that's not even, "Oops, I'm so silly! I've just lost the time". He *specifically* booked a *show.* Maybe I'm going to have to kill him.
