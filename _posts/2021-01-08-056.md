#### TREXEL

Special thanks to Fleuranna. May you never be recognised queuing up for pudding a second time, whilst wearing a false moustache.

##### [show theme]

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Accessing -- Network communication schematic.

#### DAVID

So if the program is-- Hmmm. Then if I-- __[writing sounds]__

#### IMOGEN

__[error buzz]__ File pathway corrupted.

#### DAVID

Okay, fine, I can't do that. Um... Right, so what if I look at their, sort of, daily schedules... __[more writing sounds]__

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Accessing -- Clone requisition and rotation logs.

#### DAVID

Yes! Well, what if I can get a lot of clones in the same room at the same time, so I can--

##### [door whooshes as Trexel enters, eliciting startled sounds from David]

#### TREXEL

David, David, David.

#### DAVID

Yes? No! Nothing! Nothing!

#### TREXEL

Now, David, I'm a man of the world, and I know when someone walks in, and somebody else rapidly closes a load of windows on IMOGEN, something's afoot. You're buying me a birthday president! How did you find out my birthday? I demand answers!

#### DAVID

Uh... Uh... The computers... um.... IMOGEN t-told me, and we're planning a surpri-- Nothing.

#### TREXEL

You're planning a surprise nothing? Well, that is a surprise. Because how can anyone really do nothing? Is that possible? Hang on. I'll just try and do nothing.

##### [starts chuckling]

See, now I'm sort of giggling. Hang on, let me try again.

##### [starts laughing more]

No, this is very difficult, I, I-- Hang on, let me try and do a surprise nothing.

Ah-hah! Whoa! Hah. I got me.

Sorry, what were we talking about?

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Like taking candy from an idiot.

#### DAVID

Uh, nothing. Uh, actually.

#### TREXEL

Oh, well there you go. Mission accomplished. Now, very important thing, David, very important thing. I've been having a bit of a think, a bit of a soul search. I've been looking through souls. I was like, is that my soul? Yes, it is. Open it up. Have a look inside. And I think that maybe __[sigh]__ the ideologies I've been looking into, in great depth, over the past few days... none of them quite fit me. You know, I'm not, I'm not about sacrificing myself to a greater corporate interest? But I'm also not about being with the people, because people are generally, how do I put this up... um, l-like unto a sewer? You understand. People are sewer people, apart from me. So, how about this? I have a new ideology built around the most simple, guiding and undeniable principle there is!

#### DAVID

Mm-hmm.

#### TREXEL

Darn, Trexel's great! I call it Trexolianism. And its tenets are very simple. You love Trexel, you give Trexel gifts. If you've got a cake, at least 60% of it goes straight to Trexel, if not all of it, if you want to get into Trexan, which is Trexel heaven. It's like regular heaven, except there's a lot more moisturiser, and a, and an ability to have many different restaurants in which to have simultaneous dates with brooms and fish, but neither of them find out, but you have to keep on changing your wig! Oh, and then __[splutters]__ the wig the wrong way round, and they're like, 'You weren't wearing that wig!' And you're, like, 'Oh ho ho. Ho, what a jape!' Y'know, like heaven.

#### DAVID

Ah... Okay, so--

#### TREXEL

So I can count you in? You're an initiate?

#### DAVID

Well, uh, let's say yes... Just a quick question though?

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### DAVID

So, the whole thing about... helping... other people, because, um... [__TREXEL:__ Mm-hmm.] if things are a bit wrong, and you wanna, kind of, just sort them out, and [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] everything we were talking about with Hartro yesterday, you know, she's like...

#### TREXEL

I'm way past that.

#### DAVID

So... so we're not, we're not going with the she's kind of spying on Standards so that we can, sort of, get a bit of leverage and, and maybe not--

#### TREXEL

Oh, David, David, you misunderstand! That's still all happening! Do you know why?

#### DAVID

_(weary)_ Why?

#### TREXEL

Because it's in my own self-interest! Now, you know, Standards and I, we haven't always seen eye-to-eye on every issue--

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Any issue!

#### TREXEL

--which makes them a mortal enemy of mine! But equally I'm not in this for 'the people', David, because 'the people' aren't me.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

So, you know, still on board with that. Hartro can go and do whatever it is that Hartro-- You know what, I've often felt that when people aren't in the same room as me, do they just stop existing? So, in, in many ways, *can* Hartro now go and spy on Standards, because if I'm not in the room, they're not there.

Does that mean [__DAVID:__ Oh no.] I have to follow Hartro around, from the vents, watching, waiting, always seeing?

#### DAVID

No Trexel, I-I'm pretty certain I spend most my time in a room, not with you. And trust me... I extremely exist during those long, long periods.

#### TREXEL

Do you, or is that a construct inside your own mind? You pop into existence when I open the door, and then it just, sort of, fills in the blanks from my great intellect.

#### DAVID

Well, quite honestly, Trexel, if everybody remembers--

#### TREXEL

Am I the only person alive? Does anything matter? If I was to go up to the, to the, to the highest heights of, of Stellar Firma, and just set off a large bomb, say, would anything matter?

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Lazy nihilism detected. Scanning for teens and teen-like objects.

#### DAVID

Wait, hang on a minute. In which case, how do they record holovids?

#### TREXEL

Good point.

#### DAVID

Because if no--

#### TREXEL

Holovids. Yeah, other people exist. There's holovids. Okay. Sure. Y'know, hey, sometimes you just have a crazy idea.

#### DAVID

Alright. No. Oh, glad we... got past that. So... Yeah, fine. Okay. Well, Hartro existing or not, we've still--

#### TREXEL

We've established this, David. Everyone exists. Can you please stop muddying the waters with your existential crisis? Everyone exists! It's not all about you!

#### DAVID

Okay, but it *is* all about you, but that actually syncs up with Hartro spying on Standards. So we're still on board with that plan.

#### TREXEL

Correctly. Now, codicil to that: you can't trust Hartro.

Remember, she's tried to kill us. Once somebody's done that, you don't trust them ever again. I should know. I've tried to kill people, and then they started trusting me again -- for a short amount of time -- and it just never works out well. So, sure, Hartro's *sort of* on our side, but I get the feeling that given the chance, if it was me, if there's a chance to betray us, she'll give it a go, because she's a tryer.

#### DAVID

Yeah, tell you what, Trexel, I-I, uh, I have a pretty good understanding of, of how fleeting trust in life can be. So, so, I'm, I'm kind of with you on that one. Don't need to preach caution at me.

#### TREXEL

Like a puff of smoke on a breeze. Pfft! It's gone.

#### DAVID

Yeah. Anyway, we have a brief to do, [__TREXEL:__ Ahhh... briefs.] because we still have, let's say, [__TREXEL:__ Oh, how I've missed 'em.] roughly 15 minutes now.

#### TREXEL

Oh, you know, when we were in our slightly self-imposed exile, I, I missed this, and you know what? I missed it specifically with you, David. I feel like, you know, sometimes we'll get lost in all this helter skelter of 'Oh, maybe the world we live in doesn't function. Oh, maybe we're gonna die. Hey, look at all these skeletons where employees should be. Is IMOGEN really working in our best interests?'

All of these questions often get in the way of the fact that we're a great team. You know, we gel, we work, we groove, we move, it's smooth! Hey dude, give it some 'tude. So let's do a brief together. Come on.

#### DAVID

Great.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Caution: excessive levels of 'tude will be met with violent crackdowns.

#### DAVID

Okay.

##### [machinery whirring as the brief pod pops out]

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Initiating.

#### DAVID

Right. Well, this one is from, uh, Yulian Rafioli, uh, pronouns are she/her. Uh, she is 'External Seeking Wisdom', and she writes to us from the Gademy Academy for Scholarly Hollers.

#### TREXEL

Oh, right. Well then we shouldn't bother.

#### DAVID

Oh, you know, the Gademy Academy for Scholarly Hollers?

#### TREXEL

Oh yes, I know a little bit about the Gademy Academy for Scholarly Hollers!

#### DAVID

And you know... what, exactly?

#### TREXEL

_(loudly, rising to shouting)_ They fear my prowess! I tried to apply for night classes, and they were like, 'No! Too loud! We've got a limit! And you're breaking things with your noises! Quiet down you!'

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ You are not convincing anyone that they were wrong.

#### DAVID

Wow. Okay, um, well, I'm gonna, I'm gonna read this out, and, and hope it provides some context for that outburst. "As the most elite academy in the galaxy built for hooting and hollering only," and the context has arrived, okay, "we have high praise for our abilities to keep youth well-expressed and invigorated by only allowing communication above 90 decibels, all day, every day."

#### TREXEL

Pftt, cowards!

#### DAVID

Sorry, Trexel?

#### TREXEL

The cowards. 90 decibels? That's child's play!

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Do not play with children by yelling at them. In fact, Trexel is banned from playing with anyone.

#### DAVID

Right. Well, "unfortunately, and completely unrelatedly, our budget keeps running short because of all the bullhorns and amplifiers that keep breaking. Do you have any solutions to keep things loud without breaking the bank?"

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ Yeah, don't be such a weak-necked fool! Weak-necked fools! Fools, with weak necks!

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ Now, Trexel, I'm just gonna-- I'm, I'm gonna stop you there.

I'm, I'm gonna stop you there, and just, just quickly ask, are *you* breaking all of their bullhorns and amplifiers?

#### TREXEL

No, I am not. I don't need a bullhorn. I don't need an amplifier. My chest and lungs are catapults of noise that will defeat even the greatest head castle! With its [__DAVID:__ Ah, I, I--] ear battlements! Smash, smash, smash!

#### DAVID

I was more thinking in the sort of spiteful sabotage, but if we can, we can just cross that off, then our solution can't be 'Ask you nicely to stop.'

#### TREXEL

No. Not my fault. Not my fault!

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Statistically speaking, it is probably your fault.

#### DAVID

Okay. Well, uh, you being too loud for the Gademy Academy of Scholarly Hollers aside, we do still need to help them, because as you've said, 'Oh, you do so miss this.'

#### TREXEL

_(softly)_ Do miss this.

Alright, fine. I'm willing to put my vengeful spite aside. I can't admit that it won't necessarily negatively impact my performance, because, you know, I maybe want to shout an answer, and they'll be all like, 'Oh, my ears are bleeding out. Oh, please get away. Please get out of our Academy. You're scaring the children!' The stupid, weak children!

#### DAVID

Well, fortunately the, uh, the suggestion is written. So unless you want to use a very big font, [__TREXEL:__ The biggest font!] but I'm writing it. So... so we're not.

#### TREXEL

I've got, I've got a new font, I've invented it, it's called Helvetica Noise!

#### DAVID

And has that been uploaded to IMOGEN?

#### TREXEL

_(dejectedly)_ No, I just wrote it down on a piece of paper.

#### DAVID

Okay. So, how am I going to write it down?

#### TREXEL

Uh... could you smush the piece of paper into the slot? Here it is, hang on, here is-- Okay, I've written it down. [__DAVID:__ Right, no, uh, hang on, fine.] Every letter is the word YELL.

#### DAVID

Okay. Well, okay. Tell you what I'm going to just staple that to the back __[sound of stapler]__ of the suggestion form [__TREXEL:__ Yay!] that can be there just to be like, hey, by the way, it would be written in this, [__TREXEL:__ Yep.] if it were setup in any way that was possible.

#### TREXEL

"Noto benito: Read in Helvetica Yell."

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Okay. Fine. Well, that aside, the key thing here is that I think, personally, they're going down a blind alley!

#### DAVID

Right?

#### TREXEL

Cos, hah, you thought I was done, but it was just a dramatic pause! Because, these bullhorns and amplifiers and all these things, they're a crutch. They're a crutch for the weak. Now, if you're, if you truly are an academy for scholarly hollerers, do you really want them to be artificially amplified? What if there's some sort of power crisis? And then all of a sudden, all of your yelling is unamplified, and not up to the task. You want natural yellers. Big natural yells!

#### DAVID

So, just, just quickly with the power crisis. Are we talking about, like, the electricity stops, or that maybe the headmaster dies and there's some sort of vacuum where they all start fighting?

#### TREXEL

Both. The headmaster dies because I arranged for an accident. And the power goes out because I've sabotaged the power. What do you do then, bucko?! Oh, not so smart now, with your ear defenders.

#### DAVID

Okay. So you're, you're suggesting that our suggestion is "Don't"?

#### TREXEL

Exactly. Release yourself from the, from the prison. Do you know of the Spartans?

#### DAVID

I... don't think I do.

#### TREXEL

Okay. Let me set the scene. It's Old Earth in year... [__DAVID:__ Right.] let's say, I don't know, 9 or 10, maybe 30. Or minus 26 or 8, it's not important, but the thing is everyone's covered in oil, and the lighting's very dramatic.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

There is this group called the Spartans. Now, they're not actually called the Spartans, they're called something like the Lambos, I'm not entirely sure, a lot of the records have been lost. But the thing about them, is people were like, 'Hey, we've invented, like, books. Oh, look at this boat.' And the Spartans are all like, 'No books! No boats! Only swimming!' People were like, 'Look, here's a bow and arrow.' And they were like, 'No, just chuck a piece of rock, really hard at their face!' because any sort of help is actually weakness.

And so their society was built around the concept that doing things the easy way was stupid and weak. And then they'd yell, 'This is our house!' and push you into a well. They just refused to adopt any sort of helpful technology. If it helps you, it makes you weak. And then they fought some sort of alien flood. But again, I have to emphasize quite how mixed the history is!

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ You've combined about four wrong things into one large, even more wrong thing.

#### DAVID

Right. Okay. So... what was your point?

#### TREXEL

My point is: amplifiers and bullhorns are weakness. So, the brief opens, "Hey idiot! Lose the bullhorns and amplifiers, because they are the indication of a larynx untrained!"

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

If you truly are a scholarly holler, you should climb a mountain every morning with 10 gallons of water on your back! Dump that water over your head so you glisten in the emerging sunlight, then yell at the top of your voice for seven to nine hours! And only then will you achieve the true heights that Trexology demands.

That's right! You join my religion. Now, I am going to need quite a lot of tithes.

_(singing)_ Tithes, tithes, ties, they make [__DAVID:__ Um--] me smiley smeyes. [__DAVID:__ Um, okay--]

And that's smiling with your mouth and your eyes. [__DAVID:__ Uh, no--] Meaning true happiness!

#### DAVID

Trexel, Trexel, stop. I just feel like, at this point, we should probably try and, like, lay a *bit* low, and I feel like suggesting that people join your religion... in a Stellar Firma brief...

#### TREXEL

Yes?

#### DAVID

Might feel like some sort of... sedition?

#### TREXEL

Sure, sure. Now I am going to counter that by saying, I have had an awful lot of pamphlets printed. Uh, here they are. 

##### [stack of paper hits the table]

#### DAVID

O-kay.

#### TREXEL

Now this one says, "Trexology! Do it you fool!" This one says, "Trexology! I mean, did you not read the other pamphlet?" I don't know if they had, but if they haven't then they'll feel guilty. This third one [__DAVID:__ Okay--] says, "Hey!!" And then that's it, but I feel they'll get the message.

#### DAVID

Alright. So which, which one's your favourite?

#### TREXEL

My favourite one, uh, is this one, "Trexology! Putting the Trex in your Ology."

#### DAVID

Okay. Well, I'm going to take that, and I'm just gonna, __[stapler sound]__ just gonna staple it to the briefing.

#### TREXEL

Lots of addendums, lots of staples.

#### DAVID

A-And we're not gonna, we're not gonna *mention* it in the brief, because, again, if that's read, it might look like sedition.

#### TREXEL

Sure.

#### DAVID

But we just have this thing, so maybe they, you know, that they open, they open the brief, a-and then they just see this kind of thing slip out, and they're like, 'Oh, what's that? [__TREXEL:__ Ooh!] Oh! [__TREXEL:__ A little Trexology.] Trexology.

#### TREXEL

Like, [__DAVID:__ Yeah.] like, when you get your communiquझs in the morning, and then out of it falls, just a really tempting pizza catalogue. And you're like, we don't have pizza, we only have slurry. And then you realize it's a circular from the pizza chains of Galactonium. And you eat the piece of paper whilst yelling _(muffled)_ 'I don't need you!' I don't need you!'

#### DAVID

Oh, I imagine that paper's still quite delicious though.

#### TREXEL

It's not! _(softly)_ Well, it's, it's, it's quite delicious. They make it out of... they make it out of a special algae. Mmmm. __[sniffs]__ Damn that delicious banned algae. Mmmm.

#### DAVID

_(softly)_ I'd like to eat some algae...

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ You have to stop this.

#### DAVID

_(very softly)_ ...from Ba-- _(emerging from reverie)_ Um, no, so Trexel, I was, I was thinking here. Um. I don't think I've ever seen you be so passionate, and also coherent. Have you considered becoming the headmaster of Gademy Academy for Scholarly Hollers? This is something that you do have a skill in, because, because you are nothing, if not extremely loud all the time.

#### TREXEL

Super loud!

#### DAVID

Yeah.

#### TREXEL

So you're saying I should abandon my work here at Stellar Firma, and become the new leader of the Gademy Academy for Scholarly Hollers?

#### DAVID

Well, maybe.

#### TREXEL

Does the fact that I have been running an anti-scholar holler campaign for the last ten years out of spite impact this at all?

#### DAVID

Ah yes. The Trexel Geistman Story.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ A tale as old as time.

#### TREXEL

Also, I might have started a number of fires. I *think* they were there.

#### DAVID

_(annoyed)_ Okay, Trexel! I did ask, I did ask you if you had sabotaged all of their amplifiers and bullhorns; [__TREXEL:__ And I had not!] I'm gonna ask you [__TREXEL:__ I had not!] again...

#### TREXEL

I did not go in there to destroy amplifiers and bullhorns. [__DAVID:__ Were-- were--] However, when you do set up a fire, some things do get burnt, sure.

#### DAVID

Do you--? Okay. Were any amplifiers or bullhorns des--

#### TREXEL

_(indignant)_ I put it to you, sir, that you can prove nothing in a court of Board!

#### DAVID

Okay. But I'm just going to ask you again, [__TREXEL:__ Sure.] that fire you started, [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] where was it?

#### TREXEL

It was in the Bullhorn and Amplifier Storage Cupboard.

#### DAVID

Okay. And what is in the Bullhorn and Amplifier Storage Cupboard?

#### TREXEL

How am I supposed to know!? I'm not the headmaster!

#### DAVID

I put it to you that it's bullhorns and amplifiers.

#### TREXEL

I take it from you, and eat it like a ripe melon!

#### DAVID

Okay. And, and, and that tastes like delicious--

#### TREXEL

Oh, it tastes like delicious truth. Fair enough.

#### DAVID

--Galactonium algae...

#### TREXEL

No! David, come back to me. Come back to me, David. Come back to me.

##### [David returns from reverie with some startled squeals]

#### TREXEL

Come out, come out of your sexy reverie.

#### DAVID

Huh... Oh... Sorry.

#### TREXEL

It comes to us all at times, David. [__DAVID:__ So slimy...] It comes to us all.

#### DAVID

No! I'm back in! Right. No. Right. Okay. So... your suggestion that they, kind of, just stop relying so much on amplifiers and bullhorns, [__TREXEL:__ Get rid.] quite frankly, it does actually sound like a pretty good suggestion, because the idea of--

#### TREXEL

Great cost saving measure?

#### DAVID

Yeah. A-A-And having students who, their like, whole raison d'être is to be really loud and then giving them things to make them louder does feel a little bit like cheating. Um...

#### TREXEL

Yes. They're a bunch of cheats.

#### DAVID

Yes. So...

#### TREXEL

Cowards!

#### DAVID

So let's-- We can put--

#### TREXEL

And on fire.

#### DAVID

Point the first, maybe don't rely so much on bullhorns and amplifiers.

#### TREXEL

Cool.

#### DAVID

Fine. Because they might all burn in a mysterious fire. Point the second. Trexel?

#### TREXEL

Yes?

#### DAVID

If *you* wanted to stop Trexel Geistman from sneaking into your Academy and burning all your bullhorns and amplifiers, how would you do it?

#### TREXEL

I would put a sign out front that says "*Not* the Gademy Academy for Scholarly Hollers", and then I'd look at it and say, 'Well, that's fairly clear.' And I go find somewhere else.

#### DAVID

__[scribbling]__ Okay, so I'm just gonna write down, just, just, just maybe write "Not" in front of your name on the sign, because any potential saboteurs maybe will just go away, and not burn all your bullhorns and amplifiers.

#### TREXEL

_(laughing)_ You'd have to be a pretty stupid saboteur to be convinced by that sign.

#### DAVID

Yep.

#### TREXEL

Well, fair enough. If you think it's enough, it's enough, David. You know, I'm nothing [__DAVID:__ Okay.] if not somebody who will skid under the bar of *just enough*.

#### DAVID

Okay. Well actually, I mean-- Look, on reflection, I think this is actually a pretty solid set of suggestions.

#### TREXEL

Hang on! Have you been consorting with Mirror!Trexel?! My fists [__DAVID:__ Huh? What?] have only just healed from my last encounter, but I'll go ten rounds with that rowdy boy again! Come at me, bro! Come at me with your backwards face!

#### DAVID

No, no, everything in this room is so matte and so flat. It's almost like looking into literal nothingness. There is no opportunity in this place for Mirror!Trexel or Mirror!David or anything, apart from the blinking screens of I.M.O.G.E.N!

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ I am all!

#### DAVID

So, no Mirror!Trexel. [__TREXEL:__ Okay.] I was metaphorically [__TREXEL:__ Okay.] thinking back on a thing...

#### TREXEL

Sure. Hang on. It's a memory, not a thing that's happening now. This is happening now, that is in the past.

#### DAVID

Only you and me now.

#### TREXEL

_(softly)_ Only me and David. And, in many ways, really only Trexel when you think about it.

#### DAVID

Fine! I'm going to submit the brief.

##### [clunk and whirr of machinery as pod is deployed]

#### TREXEL

Sure. But you've got, you've got the two addendums? You've got Helvetica Noise [__DAVID:__ Yes.] and you've also got my informative leaflets.

#### DAVID

I have.

#### TREXEL

Okay. 

#### DAVID

Yes. They're both on-- They're just--

#### TREXEL

As long as they stay on there.

#### DAVID

Yep. No, it's going back in the little cupboard.

#### TREXEL

Okay, you're not, you're not tearing them off is.... No?

##### [computer beep]

#### DAVID

No, no, no.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Submitting!

#### DAVID

They're going in the cupboard, they're going in the cupboard.

##### [machinery whirs and panel closes with a clunk]

#### TREXEL

Okay, fine. Yeah, fine. Fine

#### DAVID

And that's closed.

#### TREXEL

_(forlorn)_ I just sometimes feel that, maybe, ever, ever since you sabotaged that tube, and with changing things, I've always just sometimes felt, maybe, when I leave, you change things, and, [__DAVID:__ No.] and don't think my ideas are good.

#### DAVID

No Trexel, I only changed things that matter.

#### TREXEL

_(brightly)_ Oh, well, that's good then. Right. Well, [__DAVID:__ Yep.] I'll be off. I've got many plans for--

#### DAVID

Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Just one moment. Okay, so--

#### TREXEL

*(crosstalk)* __[sighs]__ We're done though.

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ No.

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ It's done now.

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ Can we just--

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ Why are you still talking?

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ Can we just go over-- Can we just go over--

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ Go over what?

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ Go over the plan.

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ I don't wanna go over anything.

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ Can we--

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ It's done. It sings-- thing's gone. What's the problem?

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ No, but can we go over the--

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ What problem?

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ No, can we--

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ The thing's gone.

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ No, but--

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ Thing gone what problem?

#### DAVID

Trexel!

#### TREXEL

Why? What?

#### DAVID

Trexel! We'll go over The Plan one more time. What are we doing with Hartro?

#### TREXEL

What plan? What are you talking about?

#### DAVID

The Plan, Trexel!

#### TREXEL

Oh, my dinner plans? Well, I'm going to have a long lunch, [__DAVID:__ Nooo!] made entirely of cocktails.

#### DAVID

*The* Plan. Capital T, capital P.

#### TREXEL

Oh, the plan to make Trexology the ultimate religion of the world?

#### DAVID

A-Actually, kind of, sort of, maybe, no, but almost--

#### TREXEL

Kind of, sort of, maybe, hooray!

#### DAVID

Right. No, remember we are currently being forced to do this by Standards, [__TREXEL:__ Sure.] right?

#### TREXEL

Sure. I remember that.

#### DAVID

And Hartro is being forced to make sure we succeed.

#### TREXEL

On pain of death.

#### DAVID

Yes. On pain of hammers.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Hammers! A fate worse than, and immediately followed by, death!

#### DAVID

We don't know why this is right now. So Hartro is going away to try and find out why.

#### TREXEL

And that is relevant to me, because...?

#### DAVID

Because, if we find out *why*, [__TREXEL:__ Uh-huh?] we are a better placed...

#### TREXEL

Sure.

#### DAVID

...to plan our briefs...

#### TREXEL

You're losing me...

#### DAVID

...to make sure that *you*...

#### TREXEL

Oh, winning me back.

#### DAVID

...are getting on the executive track...

#### TREXEL

Oooh!

#### DAVID

...quicklier.

#### TREXEL

Yes! And also to promote my new religion through a series of large media ad buys.

#### DAVID

Fine. Actually that's a good point.

#### TREXEL

What?

#### DAVID

If, hypothetically, you were theoretically thinking about...

#### TREXEL

A hypothetical theoretical? Interesting. Go on.

#### DAVID

... thinking about, possibly, maybe, spreading the word amongst... people, [__TREXEL:__ Sure, sure.] maybe, about a thing, possibly Trexology, maybe [__TREXEL:__ Could be.] _(mumbles the next bit rapidly)_ clone uprising, maybe otherwise.

Um, and you... Trexel, as I said, are nothing, if not good at being heard about things. [__TREXEL:__ Excellent, yes.] So how would you go about--

#### TREXEL

Say no more, David! You've come to exactly the right sort of person.

Now, the thing to consider when you're trying to get the word out to the people, [__DAVID:__ Mm-hmm.] we're trying to get the word out to the masses, someone like Stellar Firma, you've got no mass media communication channels. They're monitored. They're managed. They'll muddle your message. And you don't want a muddled message to the masses, because they'll become munfused.

Now, what you've got to do then, is get to people directly. You've got to visit them one by one and say, 'Hey, look at me, look at me, look at me, Trexology is the way to go.' And then you hand them a leaflet. It's that face-to-face direct interaction that will, however, take an incredibly long time if you're trying to get to every one of the masses. That's why they're called the masses, there's masses of them!

#### DAVID

Yeah. And, and also, Trexel, consider the fact that, that maybe, possibly, hypothetically [__TREXEL:__ Sure.] Trexology is not looked kindly upon by certain elements of Stellar Firma, if you are specifically and individually talking to people and then handing them a pamphlet, [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] it'll be very easy [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] to trace the idea back to you, [__TREXEL:__ Exactly.] and so *you* get, I dunno, [__TREXEL:__ Recycled immediately.] put into a maelstrom, y'know?

#### TREXEL

Sure, something like that, some sort of bad outcome. So it's, it's, you know, it's a dangerous game, but, you know, that's what you have to do if you want to get people round to your side, you got to look them in the eyes, and maybe threaten their loved ones.

#### DAVID

Okay. And it's going to be you... and you are attached to me... [__TREXEL:__ And...] and if you're found or something, I will be held... O-kay.

#### TREXEL

Sure!

#### DAVID

I-- Right.

#### TREXEL

Which is why I'm going to be, uh, preaching *my*, uh, gospel of Trexology right down on the QT, leaning over to people in bars and saying, 'Hey, you're drunk, I'm drunk, here's a leaflet.' You know, keeping it low-key.

#### DAVID

Okay. Well, tell you what, I think we could maybe punch up some of your leaflets. Uh, you know, really, really sell this kinda thing. So I'd like to offer as an, as an, as a devotee of Trexology--

#### TREXEL

Welcome my child.

#### DAVID

Yes. Well. Thank you very much... Trexel. Um, I-I'm gonna--

#### TREXEL

Call me, 'Our Heavenly Father'.

#### DAVID

__[sighs]__ Trexel, I am going to, maybe give them a bit of an edit and just, just really punch up the language here, so that when you hand them out, people just really *get* the message.

#### TREXEL

Sure. Okay.

#### DAVID

Yeah?

#### TREXEL

Fine, fine. But I'll keep it in a down-low, quiet sort of way, because nobody wants to be found out by the authorities and murdered.

#### DAVID

Absolutely, yes. And I definitely trust you to do it quietly and under the table.

So, you just leave your pamphlets with me, f-for now, [__TREXEL:__ Okay.] and I'll just make some, make some edits, and really sell, really *sell* the idea of Trexology. Okay?

#### TREXEL

Wow, I'm j-- David, I'm so glad you're so on board. I expected more resistance from you because you're an objectionable turd!

#### DAVID

Thank you, our heavenly father, I'll see you later.

#### TREXEL

See you later! _(singing)_ Floating away on a cloud of magnificence, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a god!

##### [door whooshes as Trexel leaves]

#### DAVID

__[sighs]__ Right, right. Time to change these so they're not going to get us killed. Uh, "Trexology is about loving the Board, and thinking the Board is..."
