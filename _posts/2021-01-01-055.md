##### [show theme]

#### IMOGEN

Rusty Quill presents: Stellar Firma.

##### [theme continues]

#### DAVID

Ah, a-and yes. So here's, here's your change, um, Angry Jim. And, uh, what was that? Was that... three furious muffins for you? Oh yes, no, I-I... To go? To go, you say? Okay, well, I'll, I'll just, I'll just get that for you. Oh. Oh, look out Sleepy Jim! Out the way. Gohhh, always on the floor with your sleepy ways.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ This is both difficult to watch and impossible to look away from.

#### DAVID

It's very nice at David's place. But, but look, it's almost the end of the day. Well, Angry Jim, I'll just get your-- Sorry about the wait on the order. Yep, here you are. Here are your three... delicious... muffins, _(voice rises in distress)_ which are definitely here... in David's Place, which is where I want to be....

##### [door whooshes open, surprising David, as Trexel enters singing]

#### TREXEL

_(singing)_ Oh, the peoples' voices [__DAVID:__ Oh, Trexel!] rise, [__DAVID:__ Wait!]

Rise in a crescendo [__DAVID:__ Trexel!] of noise. [__DAVID:__ Yeah.]

For the people will not be [__DAVID:__ Trexel, noi--] downtrodden anymore! [__DAVID:__ Trexel!]

They will have to be heard [__DAVID:__ Trexel!] with their needs or something and stuff

For the people [__DAVID:__ Tr-Trexel!] will rise!

Brother David, welcome! Welcome to the glorious future!

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ No, to whatever this is.

#### DAVID

Why have you painted a red star on your face?

#### TREXEL

I've been reading, David, which is unusual for me because [__DAVID:__ Yes.] books and words are for losers! But I have been reading about this thing called 'communism'. _(mispronounced as 'commune-ism')_

#### DAVID

Right...

#### TREXEL

And I like it!

#### DAVID

O-O-Okay. What is this--?

#### TREXEL

You, you, you, you put me on it, didn't you, David! You put me on it! [__DAVID:__ What?!] Thank you, Brother David! [__DAVID:__ Wh--?] With your talk of unions and collectivisation and all that stuff. I went back and, and went and had a... big drink, and then I had another big drink, and then I snorted something. I don't know what it was, could have been from a battery.

And then I started looking on I.M.O.G.E.N. about, about unions. And then it said, 'Are you looking at unions? Do you want to talk about communism?' And then it said, 'Do Not Enter: Restricted Knowledge.' And I sort of mashed my face and hands into the keyboard until it said, 'Oh, welcome, welcome. Look at the forbidden information', I think it did again... there was a lot of blood, and so much of that stuff that came out of a battery. And it was all talking about these people who wanted betterment for all mankind-- I'm part of mankind and I want stuff!

There was Max Crab. There was, uh, uh, the Lion Vladimir, and there was also Trotsky, the Horse!

#### DAVID

Uh...

#### TREXEL

And I am an acolyte now!

#### DAVID

Right. And that's why you--

#### TREXEL

Collectivise the farm!

#### DAVID

Uh, we don't have any--

#### TREXEL

Wheat! Wheat, for some reason!

#### DAVID

Um, could you have maybe turned up on time? Maybe?

#### TREXEL

Ahhh, in the glorious future, no-one shall turn up on time. Or leave on time. Time will be abolished as a tool of the borge-was-way!

[Editor: Mispronunciation of 'bourgeoisie']

#### DAVID

But, but I've been, I've been, I've been mashing my hand into the panel for, for, for, for hours at the start of the day, and the brief wasn't turning up. And the only time the brief doesn't turn up are, are the days when Hartro appears. But Hartro isn't here and... __[is interrupted and surprised by the door whooshing open]__ Argh!

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Sorry, I couldn't get a word in with Trexel shouting.

Line manager is approaching, and also has arrived.

#### HARTRO

_(dourly)_ Dun... dun duh dun, dun duh dun duh review, review, review.

#### DAVID

Uh...

#### TREXEL

Hartro! That was more... more dramatic than I'm used to. Is that a top hat?

#### HARTRO

Am I dramatic? Do I look as though something has died, and I am dressed for it?

#### DAVID

You're wearing a cape!

#### TREXEL

And, uh, and, and, sort of, shiny black shoes, and, uh... quite the black cravat.

#### HARTRO

Well, I think it is fitting--

#### DAVID

Have you been scattering roses?

#### HARTRO

Yes, I have! Something has died.

#### TREXEL

Is it my enemies?

#### HARTRO

Something has died deep inside of me.

#### TREXEL

Oh... Oh, okay. That's something I don't care about.

#### HARTRO

But anyway, you know, the show, the show goes on, doesn't it? Doesn't it? That's what they say.

#### TREXEL

They do.

#### DAVID

So, so we're still doing reviews?

#### HARTRO

Yeah, yes we are.

#### TREXEL

And also, I'd like to welcome you, Sister Piltz. Welcome to the glorious revolution that I am organising! I'm in charge! And also, at the end of it, everything, sort of, belongs to everyone. As long as secretly, it all kind of belongs to me for some reason.

#### HARTRO

David, what, what is he talking about? What 'sister', what?

#### DAVID

Well, I mean the, the last, the last, um, the last brief we had talked about unions. [__HARTRO:__ Oh, I--] He, he, he, he did some research.

#### TREXEL

I've done research.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Information was put in his proximity. I wouldn't call what he did with it, research.

#### TREXEL

I've done illicit research.

#### HARTRO

You've, you've been researching? You've been, you've been going beyond the call of duty? You've been, you've been... *thinking*?! Have you been *thinking*, Trexel?!

#### TREXEL

Well, yes, it doesn't sound like me, but yes, I suppose I, I have been learning, and becoming educated, and for some reason everybody wants to ban the cigars I make! That doesn't seem to make sense, but it's the case!

#### HARTRO

Right. Just shut it, Trexel. I'm-- We need to do a review, and I need to disrobe. Funeral's over, uh, where's your disrober? Oh, here it is.

##### [there's a click, and a variety of machine whirring & clanking is heard, as Trexel and David both make gentle exclamations of surprise]

#### HARTRO

And... and I assume you have a hat receptacle in here somewhere? Oh yeah, there we go.

##### [more whirring noises, more exclamations of surprise]

#### TREXEL

I didn't know we even had a disrobing machine. This-- There's a lot more hidden in these walls than I thought!

David, what have you been hiding in the walls? [__DAVID:__ I--] Is it the wealth of the people?! [__DAVID:__ I--] Redistribute the wealth of the people, David!

#### DAVID

I-I would redistribute everything if I could do it! I've been slapping things all day.

#### HARTRO

Er, David is a clone. I doubt he has access. Anyway--

#### TREXEL

How-- *I* have access as a consultant?

#### HARTRO

No. Just sit there, please.

#### TREXEL

Sitting down.

#### HARTRO

Sit on that square.

#### TREXEL

This, this square here?

#### HARTRO

Yeah.

#### TREXEL

There's no, there's no chair in this square.

#### HARTRO

Yeah. Sit in the square! I would like you in a square. I would like-- if you leave that square, [__TREXEL:__ Yes?] we will have words.

#### TREXEL

Ooh, what kind of words? Kind words like 'hug'?

#### HARTRO

You are trying to distract me. And I-- This is what you do every time, Trexel. I come in. [__TREXEL:__ I-I haven't tried to do anything!] I was in a bad mood. You could tell, you saw what I was wearing. [__TREXEL:__ Dressed like a funeral person.] Alright. [__TREXEL:__ Okay.] Now I'm just trying to get on with the review. And if I could do that, [__TREXEL:__ I'm sitting in the square.] then maybe we could make some progress.

#### TREXEL

Sitting in the square. You seem very up-at-arms, Hartro. I'm sitting in the quiet, Trexel square.

#### DAVID

Well, last time we did see her, she did have a paper gun.

#### TREXEL

That's true. [__HARTRO:__ Uh--] Was that a real gun? I-- We're pretty--

#### HARTRO

Do you want me to bring my real gun here?

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Potentially real, potentially paper gun detected, Security sort of alerted.

##### [Trexel mutters something incoherently]

#### DAVID

Is that, is that the real gun or the paper gun?

#### TREXEL

David, don't push it. There's murder in those eyes.

#### HARTRO

Alright, David, you can sit right here next to him. You can sit in this little triangle here.

#### TREXEL

Yes! David's in trouble!

#### HARTRO

There.

#### DAVID

No.

#### TREXEL

Get in the naughty triangle, David, next to the bad square.

#### DAVID

No!

#### HARTRO

Like little children, sitting in shapes.

#### DAVID

No!

#### HARTRO

What do you mean, 'No'?

#### DAVID

No!

#### TREXEL

Hones--

#### HARTRO

What do you-- What do you mean 'No'?!

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Warning -- clone defiance detected!

#### DAVID

I mean, no! No, you, [__HARTRO:__ Fine!] you took me out of my place. Y-You took away my muffins, my Angry Jim... No more! I am sitting in a chair!

#### HARTRO

David, you don't have a place.

#### DAVID

Or? Or, what?

#### TREXEL

Ooh.

#### HARTRO

_(angry)_ Or I will get my real gun, and I will stick it... somewhere you don't want.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Let's imagine she means in your face.

#### HARTRO

And I'll... make you wear socks. __[David shudders]__ I know there's a clone receptacle around here somewhere. I'll just put you in there, David, and then we'll g-get on with something.

#### TREXEL

Ooh, David's gonna go to clone prison.

##### [panels slide aside]

#### HARTRO

Oh, not that one.

##### [more panels sliding, whirring, machinery snaps into place]

#### HARTRO

Ah, what do we need a disco ball in here for?

#### TREXEL

It's shiny though.

##### [drawer slides open, bottles clink]

#### HARTRO

_(frustrated)_ Nope. Nope. That's the, that's the sparkling slurry. This is for successes. This is what you drink when you do a good job.

#### TREXEL

Ooh, a delicious bottle of sparkling slurry, how expensive and lovely.

##### [Hartro drops the bottle, it smashes; Trexel makes disappointed sounds]

#### HARTRO

Not for you. Not for losers.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### HARTRO

Oh we-- I can't, I can't find it, but just... sit on the triangle.

#### DAVID

No. I'm going to sit in my chair, and then we're going to do the review. Because you need us!

#### TREXEL

I don't like it when mum and dad fight.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Do not try and establish that dynamic.

#### HARTRO

I'm going to sit in my... bed! Right here. Ooh.

#### DAVID

That's my bed.

#### HARTRO

No, that's my bed, [__DAVID:__ There's a bed in here!] David. That's my bed.

#### TREXEL

Sitting in your bed, how d'ya like that, David?

#### HARTRO

I outrank you, David. I'm laying in this bed, and it's comfortable. Ooh.

#### DAVID

Fine. Fine. I'm happy with my chair. I'll be sleeping in this chair. This chair is fine. This is David's chair. This is David's place now.

#### HARTRO

Ahh, this is a comfortable bed.

#### DAVID

Stop doing that on my bed!

#### TREXEL

Okay. Um, could I just, sorry, could I just, uh, get everyone's attention please? Just for a moment.

#### DAVID

What?

#### HARTRO

I don't know, I'm very sleepy all of a sudden.

#### TREXEL

No. Okay. Okay. Um, this is, I'm not, I'm not used to you both being this weird at each other. Normally it's all about me. And it seems to be about one of you two, for some reason, and I'm uncomfortable.

#### HARTRO

I'm not weird.

#### DAVID

Shut up, Trexel!

#### TREXEL

You're grinding your bottom into his bed while making eye contact in an aggressive fashion, Hartro! If that's not weird, then I'm not Trexel Geistman, fellow traveller!

Now, David, Hartro. How about we all just sit in regular chairs, not in squares on the floor, on beds with eye contact... David, you can stay in that chair, that's a regular chair. How about we all just sit in the chairs and try and work this out as a weird family.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ As utterly wrong as it sounds, Trexel might be making sense.

#### DAVID

Okay. Um. Hartro, I don't know about you, but I feel strange now. Uh, Trexel's being reasonable. I think we should--

#### TREXEL

That's right!

#### HARTRO

I never feel strange. I always feel completely comfortable in every situation I'm ever in. I feel completely comfortable right now.

#### TREXEL

Yes, hence you're, you're sweating and the darting eyes, and the, the sort of the, the panicky look--

#### DAVID

Ooh.

#### HARTRO

You know what, I'm not, I'm not tired anymore. I want to get out of this bed.

#### DAVID

O-Okay.

#### TREXEL

Yes. Yes.

#### DAVID

Would you like this... chair here? __[chair scrapes on floor]__

#### TREXEL

This chair.

#### HARTRO

What are you offering?

#### DAVID

That we're not telling you to get in... No, no, no. It's just, it's just a chair that's there. And we-- It's just a completely incidental chair.

#### TREXEL

Optional chair.

#### HARTRO

I notice that David 7 is, is offering me a chair. That he's generously offering me a chair. Thank you, David 7, for pulling out a chair for your line manager.

#### DAVID

Right.

##### [further chair scraping]

#### HARTRO

Now, I... I hear that Paradrak-- I heard they got you settled in here nicely.

#### TREXEL

Oh yes! A very impressive individual is Paradrak. [__DAVID:__ Ahh... ] We're friends, you know. We haven't spent any time together, and they didn't indicate that they liked me, but, uh, we're bosom buddies!

#### HARTRO

I agree with you there, Trexxel. Paradrak is... gets results, you know, and that's what it's about, isn't it? At the end of the day, you can drink, you can... moisturise, [__TREXEL:__ Sure.] you can... have a bad father relationship, [__TREXEL:__ Who doesn't!] but at the end of the day you get results.

Unlike you. This is the difference between the two. Do you see what I'm pointing out now, between you and Paradrak?

#### TREXEL

Yeah, no, I-I-I understand. I-- We both, we both do those things, except I, at the end of the day, have never really delivered on... any single thing... in my career... __[trails off]__

#### HARTRO

Well, I'm putting a tick on that box... __[marker pen sounds]__

#### TREXEL

_(softly)_ That leaves room for improvement, I suppose. And also in the glorious revolution to come, I suppose, all of this will be... meaningless. If only I knew what the revolution was about, or what we wanted, or what a revolution is?

Anyway! I'm sure it's not important. So, we're reviewing! Now we haven't, we haven't done much, but we, we did do a good, a good job yesterday, I think we can all agree. Wouldn't you agree, David? [__DAVID:__ Uh...] I think we did an excellent job.

#### DAVID

_(unconvinced)_ We... did a job. Um...

#### TREXEL

Yes!

#### DAVID

Yeah, we--

#### TREXEL

Let-- Why don't we, why don't we, why don't we take you through it Hartro? Why don't we take you through it? Let's take you through it. So, so, so, I'll take the lead here--

#### HARTRO

You know what? I'm, I'm gonna go back into bed. I'm going back in the bed. You take me through it. __[blanket noise, as Hartro slips back into bed]__

#### TREXEL

Okay. We-- Whatever. Okay. Okay.

#### DAVID

Okay, just...

##### [Hartro sighs comfortably]

#### DAVID

That's... still... still my...

#### HARTRO

I'm listening. I'm putting the pillow over my head, but I'm listening.

#### TREXEL

Right, well, we were helping the New O'Neal Commercial and Industrial Hyperdynamics and Lotion Innovations, ah, because they had some sort of, you know, union problem, unfair wages, yada, yada, yada, and the, and they wanted us to help, you know, stop all of that business.

And so what we did is, is, um, well, your remember David, we, we, we, uh, we talked about, what, what a union could be, could be, and how it could be remarketed. Uh, a-and we decided, 'Well, hey, unions, oh, it's quite, it's quite scary. Ooh, ooh, oh, negotiations. [__DAVID:__ Yeah, well...] Oh, that's quite intimidating. What about a fun chat?'

#### DAVID

Yes, we, we, we rebranded unions to, to fun chats, and, [__TREXEL:__ Yes!] and then we asked, um, New O'Neal to, sort of, get them around the table, and just actually talk to them.

#### TREXEL

Yes. Just engage with your workforce. And then if they, at any point look like they're gonna threaten the longevity of your company, you blow them out an airlock! Because they've got to learn, the stupid proles!

#### DAVID

Which is a real communal--

#### TREXEL

Yeah. You know, like, you know, like proper unions? [__HARTRO:__ No.] See!

##### [Hartro makes some distressing noises]

#### TREXEL

Ah, you seem to be chewing on the pillow there, Hartro. Is that, is that... __[more distressed Hartro noise]__ Thought that was... Uh...

#### DAVID

That's my pillow.

#### TREXEL

_(quiet)_ Sort of wet, now...

#### HARTRO

Alright, is it over? Is it over?

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ In the short term, yes. In the long term, never.

#### TREXEL

Yeah!

#### DAVID

Yeah. That was pretty much it

#### TREXEL

That's pretty good, I thought. High fives all around.

#### HARTRO

It's, it's not, it's not high five. It's not this. This is do, do you know what's happening? Do you know, do you know [__TREXEL:__ Low five?] what you're doing? [__TREXEL:__ No five.] Do you, you don't get it! _(getting increasingly annoyed)_ You just need to get the brief, and do something that's not going to cause a lot of attention! You just need to, to tick a few things, come up with an idea that isn't crazy! Don't try to do something so ridiculous!

You're not, you're not starting a revolution, Trexel! You're filing a brief. But could you do that? Can you, can you just do that, and remain undetected? Can you just shuffle along?

#### TREXEL

Okay. Okay. Okay, Okay. __[Hatro trails off into sputtering]__ Hartro, Hartro, Hartro... Look at me. Is what you're asking me: Trexel, can you do the very basics of your job, ideally within a reasonable timeframe?

#### HARTRO

_(exasperated)_ Yes! Yes!

#### TREXEL

I'm gonna level with you, Hartro, the answer to that question is: No. And it will always be 'No'. And as long as you're fine with that, we can be friends!

_(singing)_ Oh, hear the people sing,

Flags are waving in the air!

See the red star that represents something -- I didn't read that far.

#### HARTRO

_(resigned)_ Yeah. That's, that's it, isn't it? That's it.

What do y-- Do you agree with him, David 7? Do you agree with what he just said? Do you think he'll ever be able to just... simply do the brief without causing a lot of attention, within the timeframe that's required?

#### DAVID

Hartro...

#### HARTRO

Yeah?

#### DAVID

You *know* the answer to that question.

#### HARTRO

_(hopeful)_ May-- maybe. M-Maybe?

#### DAVID

N-No! No, it's a 'No', it's always 'No'.

#### TREXEL

Firm 'No'!

#### HARTRO

Okay, well then we have a problem!

#### DAVID

Well, yeah, of course we do! You came at us with a gun! A-And put us here!

#### HARTRO

_(quavering)_ A real gun!

We have got a problem, boys, because--

#### TREXEL

Hartro, are you, are you in some sort of trouble?

#### HARTRO

No, of course not. _(quietly)_ Of course not. Of course not.

Everything is, everything is under control. And you can't do what I need you to do. Okay. So I've been, I've been working for Standards. Alright? We know this, right?

#### TREXEL

Yes. Yeah, we know that, [__DAVID:__ Yes.] you're a traitor. You traited us. You did, you did a traitor on us.

#### HARTRO

I didn't have a choice, okay.

#### DAVID

And now you need us, which is why you found us.

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### HARTRO

There was a bit of a confusion when my training gauntlet had a... interesting outcome, and it was misunderstood by everyo--

#### TREXEL

The, the, the attempted murder! The time you tried to kill us. Yeah.

#### HARTRO

I was doing something that is very edge, edge of its seat, and people just ready for it.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ It was cutting edge, bleeding edge, also burning edge, and sort of dissolving edge.

#### HARTRO

Anyway, I've been forcibly working--

#### TREXEL

A cutting edge solution like being stabbed!

#### HARTRO

--and, and I had been working for Standards and, and then, then, then basically... __[sighs]__ I can't do what they need me to do.

#### TREXEL

Well, what do they need you to do, Hartro?

#### DAVID

They need you to be competent, Trexel.

#### TREXEL

Oh, well that's going to go badly for you. You're doomed, Hartro! You're doomed to die.

#### HARTRO

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You see, that's-- that's where you're wrong. Hartro, Hartro doesn't die! Hartro doesn't die!

#### DAVID

Why don't you fight Standards? __[sound of disbelief from Hartro]__

#### TREXEL

Ooh, interesting. David, expand on that point.

#### DAVID

Well, I... could have been killed *every day*, for literally *no* reason. At all!

#### TREXEL

Mmm. Often it was preventable, and I just didn't try.

#### DAVID

And, and I haven't yet. Right? So I'm living proof, that if everything wants to kill you, if you don't want it to it, it can't! So... stop it!

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ I think your conclusion is flawed, but it sounded pretty good! So let's not worry.

#### HARTRO

It does feel like everything wants to kill me.

#### DAVID

Well, what's Standards gonna do?

#### HARTRO

_(sadly)_ That is the-- That was the get up, and the dun dun duh dun... I can't really hide it anymore. I mean...

#### TREXEL

It was very dramatic. I don't, I don't think you hid it at all, Hartro! __[Hartro sniffs]__ You turned up literally in funeral clothes.

#### HARTRO

Well, I'm, I'm not going to die.

#### DAVID

Well, so-- Yeah. So why don't we work together? Like, Trexel *cannot* be good at his job.

#### TREXEL

Hello!

#### HARTRO

No, impossible. Impossible! And I've tried. Do you know how I have tried?

#### DAVID

_(grimly)_ Yes, I was there!

#### TREXEL

You ma-- And I wanted to-- I don't think we should let this go.

You built quite an elaborate diorama with that whole Chicken/Fox/Seed thing.

#### HARTRO

I know!

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ That, that, that took a lot of work--

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ You ran us some sort of--

#### HARTRO

_(crosstalk)_ I thought that would work!

#### DAVID

You ran us a weird game for nerds.

#### HARTRO

_(crosstalk)_ Yeah, I did, I did!

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ Yeah, that was, that was stupid! But you know, it killed a couple of hours.

#### DAVID

Y-Y-You built a whole murder trial for us. I mean, that was trying to murder us, but you know, it was impressive!

#### TREXEL

Where did you get all the acid from? That's a question. And how do you store acid? Because if acid, like, melts the tables, what do you keep it--? It's unimportant! But it's impressive is what we're saying. You've got skills. [__HARTRO:__ I've got skills!] You just keep trying to apply them to the wrong thing, which is me!

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ The solution to Trexel, is to not Trexel in the first place.

#### HARTRO

That's it! I don't know [__TREXEL:__ I j--] why I didn't see it sooner! You're impossible to fix!

#### DAVID

Tell you what? __[Hartro breathes a sigh of relief]__ Why don't... you just *lie* about how we're doing?

#### HARTRO

Oh yeah? I could-- I have lied before. I mean, in, in, in, in the, you know, [__DAVID:__ Yeah.] for the greater good, f-for the--

#### DAVID

Right? And the greater good is you not being...

#### HARTRO

Killed.

#### DAVID

Killed, I guess.

#### HARTRO

Ah, yeah... I wouldn't be hurting the Board. I mean... __[trails off]__

#### TREXEL

No! We all love the Board here!

#### HARTRO

_(crosstalk)_ No, of course!

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ Yeah!

#### IMOGEN

_(crosstalk)_ __[beep]__ Hail the Board!

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ We all love the Board!

#### HARTRO

It's just... It's just that Number 1 and that Number 48.

#### TREXEL

Yeah, Hammer Time.

#### HARTRO

If I could just get rid of them!

#### TREXEL

Well, now, we have entered Trexel's sphere of expertise: planning a murder! We've never done this before as a group! I'm so excited! I've got crepe paper. Hang on, I'll just get it.

##### [sound of searching for craft stuff]

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ No good has ever come of the combination of Trexel Geistman and craft!

#### HARTRO

_(softly)_ This is a bad idea.

#### TREXEL

Okay. Okay. Okay. Right, right. Okay. So, so, I've made a little map of all of the bits of the vents that I know. [__HARTRO:__ I'm not going in a vent.] And this, I think, is where Standards are... You, ah, oh come on Hartro, get into the spirit of it! This is a vent-based murder plan!

##### [Hartro sighs heavily]

#### TREXEL

Okay. Okay. Okay. So, so we're here. I think. I'm not sure where things are. And Standards is here. I think. I'm not sure where things are. And all we need to do is find where they are, and then paper up all the cracks, and watch them suffocate to death. Or, or if you don't like that, we need to steal a bulldozer. I think they've got some on, on the lower construction deck. [__HARTRO:__ Okay] And then we just need to drive it through room after room until we hit them! Sure, there'll be collateral damage, but what's collateral damage except something that I don't really mind!

#### HARTRO

Okay, okay... You know--

#### TREXEL

_(increasingly frantic)_ Or, or, if you don't like that, if you don't like that, I've got this big knife! Now you say, 'A knife, Trexel? Well, you, you, unless you're standing in front of them, you can't use it.' But guess what? The knife is two miles long. You just jab it in all directions!

#### HARTRO

_(crosstalk)_ Oh look--

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ Where'd you get a two mile knife?

#### TREXEL

_(frantic)_ Okay. Sure. That doesn't work for you. Two mile knife, it'll bend! I hear you. I hear you. But I've been working on something else. Paper cuts. Everyone hates them. But, what if you paper cut somebody with a rock? You beat them in the face with a rock causing many paper cuts until they die! You seem unconvinced!

Okay. Electrical shocks. No one likes them. Everybody has them. So we need to rig up a chair with some sort of electrical charge, and then you just place it, maybe putting a pillow on it that says 'Sit on me, I'm not going to murder you!'

_(shouting)_ You don't seem convinced, but one of these has to work! This is my only area of expertise!

#### DAVID

Trexel, we don't--

##### [Trexel is panting heavily from his vocal exertion, then collapses heavily]

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Whoops! There he goes!

#### HARTRO

He's passed out. Oh David, have we made a terrible mistake?

#### DAVID

Always.

I don't-- We don't know where Number-- Look, now that he's--

##### [Trexel awakes, gasping like a fish out of water]

#### DAVID

Oh, he's back. Look--

#### TREXEL

I had a beautiful dream in which I was some sort of king.

Uh, I'm just gonna lie down on, on the bed here. Hah. You keep going. I got a little... overexcited there.

#### HARTRO

Yeah. The-The-There, you just take my pillow. There you go. You sh-shh-should just stay there. [__TREXEL:__ Thank you.] And then just-- I'm just gonna go over here with David for a second.

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ That's mine... mine... and my bed...

#### TREXEL

_(sings softly as lullaby)_ My Geistman in the corner...

#### DAVID

So-- No. Look. He doesn't know where Number 1 and Number 48 are. And he--

#### HARTRO

Obviously, look at his map!

#### DAVID

Well, yeah, it's, it's, it is drawn in crayon, and it's just a smiley face. But do *you* know where Number 1 and Number 48 are?

#### HARTRO

_(softly, realising)_ I do.

Or I can, I can track-- I, I have communication lines open.

#### DAVID

Right? So, we, we can't just storm out of here, and, uh, hit them in the face with a rock, thus giving them... paper... cuts.

#### HARTRO

No. No, no, no.

#### TREXEL

_(to self, sleepily)_ Perfect plan.

#### DAVID

But... you, you have access to them, right? [__HARTRO:__ Yes, yes.] You're working with them. So... see if you can find out any of their weaknesses. [__HARTRO:__ Yeah...] Like, how can, how, how can we get leverage on them? How could we get them to, how could we get them to just leave us alone? And let us have--

#### HARTRO

Yeah! A reconnaissance mission! Yeah...

#### DAVID

--some sort of nice cafÃ©.

#### HARTRO

That--

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Let it go, David, the cafÃ© is gone.

#### HARTRO

Uh...

#### DAVID

Or not kill you with a hammer. I don't know! Just, just either way--

#### HARTRO

Yeah, just not kill me with a hammer. We'll see. Well, you know, people have things that they need, and you have things that you need, and I don't think that they, maybe, might come true. We'll see! But this is a good idea, David 7. And I like the way you're thinking.

#### TREXEL

__[yawns]__ Right. Can I chip in just for a moment?

##### [Hartro gives a dismissive sigh]

#### TREXEL

Also, can you tell them that not only are we doing a good job, but that Trexel is doing an amazing job, and should be promoted with some sort of medal.

#### DAVID

Uh--

#### TREXEL

You know, just to keep things under the radar, as they'd expect. [__TREXEL:__ W-We need to keep things believable, Trexel.] Maybe, Employee of the Millennium. Sorry? What was that David?

#### DAVID

We need to keep things believable.

#### TREXEL

I'm sorry, I-- what's, what's not believable at me being the best person alive? I don't, I don't--

#### DAVID

Well, we're already really kind of stretching it by saying you're doing a... good... job, so we don't really wanna...

#### HARTRO

Yeah. Yeah. The, the key here--

#### TREXEL

Did you not hear my thing about the rock?! That's gold! Tell them that. No, don't tell them that, that's a murder plan. I can't believe you nearly did that, Hartro!

#### HARTRO

The key is... to remain undetected, to, to be like a, a clear glass--

#### TREXEL

Duck! A clear, glass duck sliding over the water. Who would suspect a glass duck?

#### HARTRO

That's right, okay, alright. Well, I, I need to grab my things in the...

##### [panels open, machinery whirs]

...hat... my cape... You know what? I-I don't even feel like I need these anymore. I'm, I'm leaving these here--

##### [fabric is dumped]

#### TREXEL

Ooh! Can I have them?

#### Hartro

--because all of a sudden, I feel slightly lifted.

##### [rustling fabric]

#### TREXEL

Yes, sir. A cape and a hat.

#### Hartro

We've got a plan guys.

#### TREXEL

Jaunty hat.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### HARTRO

We've got a plan.

#### DAVID

Alright. Well, if you find anything, come back to us. I mean-- I'm assuming we have the next review, so you can, you can kind of report back then, a-and we can, we can see what we're, see what we're up against.

#### TREXEL

Hang on a minute. I've got a term for this. Hey guys, why don't we circle back to this later? That's a business phrase!

#### HARTRO

Yeah. And in the meantime, keep your lips sealed.

#### DAVID

Yep.

#### TREXEL

Mmm, with glue. I'm going to seal David's lips with glue. Will do. Right, thanks Hartro!

#### HARTRO

Bye.

#### TREXEL

See you later!

#### DAVID

Bye.

##### [doors whoosh as Hartro leaves]

#### DAVID

Alright.

#### TREXEL

That seemed to go. We pulled the wool over her eyes.

#### DAVID

_(warily)_ Yes...

#### TREXEL

Now, David, you're gonna have to explain something to me.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

What are we doing? I've become a bit lost. Am I a revolutionary? Am I some sort of Vladimir Lion?

#### DAVID

I have no idea. This is why you shouldn't go down I.M.O.G.E.N. holes.

#### TREXEL

No, I get confused. I get confused. You know, I once found there was documentary evidence of this really old cereal called 'Goodbye Ohs'. And it was these, sort of, little hoops. And when you ate them, you died. And that's why they were 'Goodbye Ohs', because you'd say 'Goodbye!', take a bite, you die. And then people are like, __[gasp]__ 'Oh, they've died.'

#### DAVID

Oh...

#### TREXEL

They've died.

#### DAVID

That sounds horrible. Okay, well maybe we could feed Number 1 and Number 48 some of these--

#### TREXEL

Oh, they, they, they went out of production thousands and thousands of years ago. But you see, there's just a load of concerning stuff in this-- So, you know what I think? I think I've gone through my... revolutionary union phase. It didn't suit me. You know, all that thing about people power. People shouldn't have power. Unless that people person with power is me, Pexel, [__DAVID:__ Right.] sorry, Trexel.

#### DAVID

Okay, Hartro's gone away...

#### TREXEL

Good. That's a good thing.

#### DAVID

Yes! Actually let's leave it there. Hartro has gone away, and that is what happened.

#### TREXEL

Ah, well, well, thank goodness for that!

And if you need anyone else murdering, let me know. I've got an endless supply of crepe paper, and also a bottomless well of murderous malice!

#### DAVID

Oh good. Um, well, yeah, if you, if you go away and maybe work on that, um... Tell you what? Why don't you try and come up with a plan to murder... um...

#### TREXEL

Bathin.

#### DAVID

...all the Megatrons.

#### TREXEL

_(disappointed)_ Oh, all the Megatrons. __[grumbles]__ I'd prefer Bathin.

Alright, fine, I'll work on the Megatron murder plan. I'm not quite sure how it fits in, __[chuckles]__ but I also don't like follow up questions. So, I'll see you later. Me, this cape and this jaunty top hat are going to go try and find where the Astral Bar is again, and have a couple of drinks.

#### DAVID

Okay, Trexel.

#### TREXEL

Murderer, away!

#### DAVID

Bye!

##### [doors whoosh as Trexel leaves]

#### DAVID

Now... there was that order for muffins!

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Board preserve me!
