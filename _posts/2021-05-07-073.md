summary: "Episode 73 - Moths and Miraculous Empathy <br/><br/>Penelope Dorp has informed us that The Weavers of the Grand Mum Guild, purveyors of the finest of mass produced Knitware have started making hostile plans against Stellar Firma for refusing lucrative Knitware tie-in deals and encouraging people towards warmer, sunnier, non-sweater-based holidays. <br/><br/>Strategic War Plan: discover selfish empathy; totally donâ€™t side with the enemy; welcome a woollen god; candy handbag diplomacy; judgmental moth snobs; faux carboard moth rocket; creative encyclopaedia editing."

#### TREXEL

Special thanks to Lillian Bokun. Remember to wrap up warm before you go outside. Oh, also remember to take oxygen-- Ah, they've gone. They've gone.

##### [show theme]

#### IMOGEN

Rusty Quill presents: Stellar Firma.

##### [theme continues]

##### [door whooshes and Trexel enters to the sounds of distant thudding]

#### TREXEL

Oh, D-- __[sighs]__ David, Da-- __[sighs]__ David. David, I can hear you through the door. David, is that pinball? David, I want to have a go at pinball. David, come out here. Come out and play with me, David! And bring the pinball machine! And then you go away. D-- Hang on, there's got to be a button here. Ooh, a, a b-- a button for the clone door. Let's just see-- __[clicks a button and the door whirrs open]__ Aha!

#### DAVID

__[stammering and playing pinball noisily]__ Ah-- Ooh-- What-- Uh, uh-- [__TREXEL:__ David. David.] Don't-- Trexel, I'm gonna get a high score. Trexel--

#### TREXEL

*(overlapping)* Okay, I, I, I want you to get a [__PINBALL MACHINE:__ Tilt!] high "Get Out Here Now."

#### DAVID

*(overlapping)* Oh, no! It's-- Oh. __[sighs]__ Tilted it.

##### [soft music from the clone lounge is audible now that the loud game of pinball has ceased]

#### TREXEL

__[stammering]__ You're a cheat, David. You're a tilty cheat. And what you need to do--

#### DAVID

*(overlapping)* I was just getting a-- N-no, I was just getting excited.

#### TREXEL

We're all excited. But what it-- If you wanna-- If you wanna tilt the machine like that and not get in trouble, what you do, is you get a small gravity well, put it right underneath it on a plate, then tilt the whole plate. The sensor still thinks it's down, but you get that sweet tilt action that you're looking for.

#### DAVID

Wouldn't that also pull the ball down?

#### TREXEL

Yes. All of the enjoyment of cheating without any of the risks, or reward, of cheating. [__DAVID:__ Right.] It's the perfect system, David. I can't believe you're even questioning it.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ It's true. Questioning Trexel only leads to more irritating questions.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

Anyway. Get out. Get out here. Come on.

#### DAVID

*(overlapping)* Yeah, okay. No, fine, fine, fine. I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming. __[exits the clone lounge and the door whirrs shut behind them, ending the music]__ So you found your way back, did you?

#### TREXEL

Oh, David, I have to thank you.

#### DAVID

What?

#### TREXEL

Thank you, David, from the-- From the bottom of my-- I didn't know you cared. David, I always thought, you know, we've got a, got a certain relationship. But it's always been a little, shall I say, rambunctious? A little bit odd, a little bit to and fro, a little bit antagonistic, but I didn't know you cared so much.

#### DAVID

Uhhh... where did you end up?

#### TREXEL

*(overlapping)* You're a real friend, David.

#### DAVID

Where did you end up?

#### TREXEL

I ended up at the best place, David. The single most pure and beautiful place in, in... I believe the whole universe.

#### DAVID

The, the Cosmic Lounge VIP room?

#### TREXEL

Think bigger, David. Think bigger, you small-brained fool. No! I ended up at the central distillery.

_(singing slowly)_ Oh, the glistening bottles gleam/

In the darkness as I creep

Along the rows of ichor goodness

Flowing into me

I'm so drunk

I'm so drunk

I've never been so drunk before

And I will drink until I'm discovered by a sensor and escorted out by a gunwall but that's... for tomorrow!

For today, we sup

Thank you, Treeeexel, and by extension, David

I suppose

_(normally)_ I composed that song while hammered. [__DAVID:__ Yes, I'm--] But you can't tell.

#### DAVID

No, and I'm assuming that the-- That was composed yesterday, so, yesterday's today was yesterday, and yesterday's tomorrow is today, meaning that you're here today, not tomorrow.

#### TREXEL

You've unpacked my plan.

#### DAVID

Are you still drunk?

#### TREXEL

You what now?

#### DAVID

Are you still drunk?

#### TREXEL

Who'd say? Who could-- Who would-- Who would, could, couldn't have a say?

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Me, and yes!

#### TREXEL

__[burbling]__ Who c-c-- who could have a say?

#### DAVID

Let me rephrase the question: will this make any difference?

#### TREXEL

Bubbles.

#### DAVID

It might make a-- Oh, oh, it might make a difference. Hmm. How do I...

#### TREXEL

Hoops. Hoops are the thing, David. Hoops. [__DAVID:__ Wait, hang on--] Hoops are the thing, David.

#### DAVID

*(overlapping)* Hang on. I'm seeing a thing. Uh. [__TREXEL:__ Hoops.] Trexel?

#### TREXEL

Mmm?

#### DAVID

I saw a bottle of whisky over there in that corner.

#### TREXEL

Oh, okay. __[chuckling to himself as he approaches the corner]__

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ Okay. And here-- Where was it? It was... a hyper-shower, there we go!

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ Where's the bottle of whisky?

##### [David turns the shower on and Trexel makes startled sounds of surprise]

#### TREXEL

Whoa, that was like being punched in the face by a waterfall that you cheated upon multiple times.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ We normally use that to blast rust off of components. But this works just as well.

#### DAVID

So how are you feeling, Trexel?

#### TREXEL

Fresh. Fresh and alert, David. [__DAVID:__ Okay.] The stupor of drink has left me, which brings me to my next point: could you press the button again? I'd love to go back down and get rid of this awful stinky awareness. Oh, everything's so clean and bright and I can see it! Put me back in the hole. Put me back in the hole [__DAVID:__ Wh--] with my lovely bottles. [__DAVID:__ Uh, now, hang on--] Please, David, please. Be a friend, be a buddy, be a pal. Put me in the hole.

#### DAVID

N-- Well-- We've still got a brief to do, so maybe we--

#### TREXEL

*(overlapping)* Oh, it doesn't matter, David! Put me in the hole. Leave the brief be. War, not war. It's all the same when you're so drunk you can't feel your own hands even though you're throttling yourself at a sort of impudent rage.

#### DAVID

Wait, you've changed your tune since yesterday. When was that? Wh-- wh-- where's Trexel's warsong today?

#### TREXEL

Oooh, now it's Trexel's Peace Anthem. _(singing)_ War war war, no no no, peace peace peace, yes. _(normal)_ Now can you press the button.

#### DAVID

No, I'm not going to press the button.

#### TREXEL

Please press the button, [__DAVID:__ We've gotta do the--] David. I'll do anything. I'll do anything.

#### DAVID

The brief.

#### TREXEL

Okay, kill them. Press the button.

#### DAVID

We can't do tha-- Look. We need to put on a good show. We are now executives. We're not even on the executive track anymore: we've reached the executive station. __[Trexel makes a sulky noise]__ And the executive conductor is looking at us, asking 'Have you got your executive ticket? Are you in executive class for a reason? Well, are you really an executive? Oh, or, or are you not? Are you some sort of imposter?' [__TREXEL:__ Hmm.] Right? So we need to just make sure we keep delivering briefs which look like real briefs.

#### TREXEL

David.

#### DAVID

Yes?

#### TREXEL

Since, since we've become executives-- You know, I'm an executive now, you're an executive clone, have you ever just, you know, and j-- I'm just saying this, I'm just thinking out loud. Have you ever thought, and I-- this is for a friend, obviously-- Have you ever just like __[burbles]__ in your dark moments at night, just thought, 'Nothing's changed, what was I striving for all this time? Oh no, oh no I've wasted my life.'

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Well, you have definitely wasted your life, if that helps.

#### DAVID

Um...

#### TREXEL

Ever though, ever thought that?

#### DAVID

Personally?

#### TREXEL

Mmm, personally.

#### DAVID

No.

#### TREXEL

Okay, well me-- well, me neither. Me neither. So, __[stammers]__ I was just checking 'cause I was just, you know. Just, just, just check-- Just a little check.

#### DAVID

Check-- Just for a f-- What was the name of your friend?

#### TREXEL

Ahhh, the friend. They are a good friend, and their name is... Hopwell.... Heistham.

#### DAVID

Right. Well, okay. Well, that sucks for Hopwell Heistham, I suppose.

#### TREXEL

Yes, that'd be awful. Imagine if you were Hopwell Heistman, and, and you spent years and years lusting after power, [__DAVID:__ Wait, i-is--] and then you got power, and then you think, 'Ah, it's kinda the same--'

#### DAVID

Sorry, I think Hopwell's name just changed from 'Heistham' to 'Heistman.'

#### TREXEL

No, no, no. Trexel Hopgeist is not changing, David. Trexel Hopgeist is a good friend of mine, and you'll leave Trexel Geistman alone if you know what's good for you.

#### DAVID

Right. Um.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Take the advice. Don't dig anymore. You are on top of a sewer.

#### DAVID

Yeah, I am actually going to leave that alone. There's a brief to do. We should do the brief.

#### TREXEL

Okay. [__DAVID:__ Fine.] Fine.

#### DAVID

Okay, so. This one is from Penelope Dorp, and she is snitching, uh, to us, about the Weavers of the Grand Mum Guild.

#### TREXEL

Oh, not the Weavers of the Grand Mum Guild.

#### DAVID

Uh, y--

#### TREXEL

No, no. This is awful, David.

#### DAVID

The Weaves of the Grand Mum Guild. What's so terrible about the Weavers of the Grand Mum Guild?

#### TREXEL

Oh, they make such luxurious sheets, David. Oh, the tog on them. You won't believe the tog! Ah, tog for days. The thread count, David. Eyes cannot count the number of threads on these duvets, these comforters, these blankets, these jumpers. _(singing)_ Oh, wonderous, wonderous time for me!/Hog in a cloth/The Weavers of Grand Mum Guild/Yeeeees!

#### DAVID

Okay, so, are you, are you worried about this because they are a formidable opponent, or just because you don't want to remove their sweaters from the world?

#### TREXEL

I wanna keep the sweaters, David. [__DAVID:__ Okay.] I wanna keep the sweaters. [__DAVID:__ Well--] Y'know, you-- When, when you're trying to give a gift to a relation that you don't know and they might be dead but you've not checked and it would it easier just to send a gift than check whether or not they're dead-- You just go straight to the Weavers of Grand Mum Guild. A scarf, David, a scarf that-- You know what? You'll want it to wrap around your face so you can't see. Because what's seeing worth when you can be so comfortable in the facial region?

#### DAVID

Okay, well--

#### TREXEL

The *tog*, David.

#### DAVID

Okay, I'm thinking, [__TREXEL:__ The tog.] I'm thinking about the tog, alright? But, look--

#### TREXEL

Imagine, imagine the tights, the denier on these tights. It, it's, it's undenierable.

#### DAVID

Right, okay, umm. Look. I just-- Given your... thoughts on the Weavers of the Grand Mum Guild--

#### TREXEL

I prefer them to my own parents.

#### DAVID

Okay. Well. Fine. Um, but the Weavers of the Grand Mum Guild-- Think about the conversation--

#### TREXEL

*(overlapping)* I prefer them to you.

#### DAVID

F-fi-- Expected. Umm, even though-- I mean, they've never sent you down a tunnel to the, y'know, central distillery, so.

#### TREXEL

Ooh. That has put you up in the ranks, David. That is true. Okay, to me, you're like a pretty good scarf.

#### DAVID

F-fine... I'll take it. [__TREXEL:__ You're welcome.] But think about what I was saying yesterday when considering your feelings about destroying the Weavers [__TREXEL:__ Hmm...] of the Grand Mum Guild.

#### TREXEL

Mmm. So, what you're saying the way I feel about something or someone who I--

#### DAVID

*(overlapping)* No. No, no, no, I see what you're trying to do here. No, I'm just saying that because of your personal experience, you might recognize that the Weavers of the Grand Mum Guild potentially do not deserve complete destruction.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ There is no chance you're going to teach him empathy at this stage. He's emotionally nonpermeable to other peoples' suffering.

#### TREXEL

No no no no no, l-let me finish my point, David. So what you're saying is because I have a personal reason not to want to kill somebody, is how you feel about lots of people for some reason because, I dunno, you're some sort of idiot? __[David sighs]__ You start from a point of 'maybe we shouldn't kill them,' whereas I'm starting at a point of, 'okay, fine, they die, unless, of course, they have something I want.' And that's called 'empathy,' is that what you're saying, David?

#### DAVID

Nnnnnooo.

#### TREXEL

Have I discovered empathy? [__DAVID:__ Nn...] Am I a good person now? [__DAVID:__ No... No...] I think I am. I don't wanna kill one specific person because I want their stuff. What a great guy I am!

#### DAVID

No, no we're really-- We're not at a ten, Trexel, [__TREXEL:__ Faaaaall at my feet!] we're at like a-- We're like a three, Trexel.

#### TREXEL

*(overlapping)* Fall at my feet. I am a guru. I am a moral guru. Do you have a quandary, David? Moral quandary? I'll help you with my moral gurosity.

##### [David sighs]

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ I did warn you, he's the man with the non-stick soul.

#### DAVID

So the problem that we have with them. [__TREXEL:__ Yes?] "They make the most comfortable sweaters and socks, mass-produced--"

#### TREXEL

Ohhh, don't they just.

#### DAVID

We've, yes, we've already gone the-- Yeah--

#### TREXEL

*(overlapping)* Oooooh, the tog, David!

#### DAVID

Yes, we've already gone over the tog. "Mass-produced but still able to give y--"

#### TREXEL

*(overlapping)* You know, if they made a woollen pig, it'd be called a toglet.

#### DAVID

Ri... Right. Um.

#### TREXEL

You know what? If there was an on/off switch for how much tog they had--

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ It would be a tog... toggle, yeah, okay.

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ It'd be called a toggle.

#### DAVID

You got-- Have you got another one?

#### TREXEL

No, just two.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

The rule of two, that's what they say!

#### DAVID

Yeaaah. Well, um. __[sighs]__ Look. "So they mass-produced them, but they're still to give you that home-made with love feeling," as we've covered with your toglets and your toggles.

#### TREXEL

'Haven't got your own home? Have a home with the Weavers of Grand Mum Guild. Locked in a house with just a pile of spoiling meat and a note that say "earn it"? Just huggle down in one of their soft, soft comforters. __[David makes an uncertain sound]__ Maybe your parent's don't love you, but we do. We do. Don't kill me, Trexel, I'm your mom. I'm your only good mom. Don't kill me in later life, Trexel. I'm a good woollen mom."

##### [David and Trexel both sigh, one in discomfort and the other contentment]

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ I would encourage you not to read into this.

#### DAVID

Uhh, so, "Stellar Firma rebuffed their offer to make the company-issued onesies, [__TREXEL:__ No!] despite the reasonable selling price, [__TREXEL:__ Exactly.] and with more and more sentient beings buying warm, sunny vacation planets from Stellar Firma, their consumer base is shrinking. __[Trexel gasps]__ This greatly displeased the Weavers in the Guild, and they have started making plans."

#### TREXEL

I don't blame them. If I were them, I'd be making plans. You know what? I'm on-- I'm on their side. [__DAVID:__ Okay.] Sod Stellar Firma. I prefer war.

##### [deep alarm tone begins to sound]

#### TREXEL

Okay, okay, that noise? That noise is making me reconsider things slightly, so what I'm gonna say is, "Stellar Firma's great, and I'm with them." Lovely. Now David, come over here.

#### DAVID

Yes?

#### TREXEL

_(quietly)_ I think we should be on their side. Shhhhh.

#### DAVID

Okay...

#### TREXEL

What's Stellar Firma ever done for me? Kept me down, ignored me, mocked me, banned me from certain bars because I did nothing wrong. And then finally I become a senior executive, and it's just the same, David. It's just the same in a fancier suit.

#### DAVID

Y-yeah. Okay, well. I mean, look--

#### TREXEL

So how do we kill everyone in Stellar Firma and install the wonderous reign of the Weavers of the Grand Mum Guild? [__DAVID:__ O-okay, no, just--] 'Cause that's what we're going for. I want a woollen garb, David, what about you?

#### DAVID

Well, uh, you could just-- You could just escape. You don't have to destroy all of Stellar Firma. You could just get out.

#### TREXEL

Ahh, so much admin, David. I'd have to move. No one wants to do that. So I'm gonna kill everyone, and install the Weavers of the Grand Mum Guild as my new rulers. [__DAVID:__ Okay, well--] Maybe I will become the leader of the Grand Mum Guild. I shall be the Grand Mum. My power will stretch across the woollen universe, 'Go here, go there! Farm those toglets, flip that toggle switch! Don't do a third one, two is fine!'

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Just thought I would remind you that you are not talking all that quietly, that I can hear you, and that I'm having to divert power from some very important systems to not recycle you for treason. Anyway! As you were.

#### DAVID

Look, Trexel, I-- __[stammers]__

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

Just cool your-- Cool your jets. Cool your jets.

#### TREXEL

*(overlapping)* I don't wanna cool my jets. I want hot jets. [__DAVID:__ No, no--] I'm on your side, David. [__DAVID:__ No, freeze your boots.] You wanted a revolution, I want a revolution!

#### DAVID

No, but-- You've just gone immediately to 'kill everyone at Stellar Firma.'

#### TREXEL

_(exasperated)_ Well, what's a revolution if it isn't an opportunity to kill everyone, David? I'm actually, genuinely asking. I don't understand the difference.

#### DAVID

Okay-- I-- We want to change things because they're wrong. Right?

#### TREXEL

Kill... everyone...

#### DAVID

No.

#### TREXEL

Okay. Carry on, carry on. Keep going, keep going.

#### DAVID

Change things... change things because they're wrong.

#### TREXEL

Change people from being alive to dead.

#### DAVID

No.

#### TREXEL

Nope, nope, no, okay, no no. I'm getting it, I'm getting-- You keep going, keep going.

#### DAVID

Okay. Restructure...

#### TREXEL

Mm-hmm.

#### DAVID

The society.

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

In order to be more egalitarian...

#### TREXEL

Because everyone's dead now.

#### DAVID

No... still... still not. That's--

#### TREXEL

It's tough, it's tough, it's a tough old concept to crack. It's a tough old, nutty concept to crack with my teeth. Num num num.

#### DAVID

Yeah, I suppose it is easier just to assume that everybody else being dead would make things simpler. That's--

#### TREXEL

*(overlapping)* It's a new movement I've called-- It's called 'the dead levelers,' because I've levelled everyone because they're dead.

#### DAVID

Right. Well.

#### TREXEL

*(overlapping)* Cromwell be damned! I've levelled your ass.

#### DAVID

Who is that?

#### TREXEL

Hmm?

#### DAVID

Cromwell.

#### TREXEL

Cromwell, yes. He works in accounts. Don't like him. [__DAVID:__ Right.] He hates Christmas.

#### DAVID

What is Christmas? There's so many things coming at me--

#### TREXEL

*(overlapping)* I don't know! He-- I think he just-- He just yells 'I hate Christmas!' He walks around the hallways saying 'I hate Christmas! Is this water purified?' I don't understand, David. I'd love it if he was dead.

#### DAVID

Fair enough. I mean, he's... sounds like a bit of an ass.

#### TREXEL

Yeah.

#### DAVID

Just.... Just consider the problems that you might have with, with Stellar Firma's approach to the Grand Mum Guild. Right? While we do this brief, just keep it [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] in the back of your mind. [__TREXEL:__ Okay!] Try and keep processing that--

##### [David agrees with a half dozen 'yeahs' as Trexel speaks]

#### TREXEL

Just keep it percolating there, like a delicious coffee. [__DAVID:__ Exactly. So, so, so--] Okay. Fine. Fine! Fine.

#### DAVID

So the problem _right_ now is we need to find a way to convince Akteraks that this will destroy the Weavers of the Grand Mum Guild, but it won't actually.

#### TREXEL

*(overlapping)* Without actually ki-- Yes. Okay, I understand, I understand the subterfuge, the sedition. It's what we're doing. Okay. I'm set.

#### DAVID

_(overlapping)_ Well, we're still going through the brief. "So their greatest strength is handbags with the right candies for any occasion."

#### TREXEL

Their sales reps have them. Oh, they're so good, because we don't-- __[stammers]__ I don't know if this has ever come up before, even once, David, but we only eat slurry here and it's awful. And they come up, and they say, 'Hey, would you like a jumper?' And I'm like, 'Yeah, I'd love a jumper.' And they're like, 'Also, can I interest you in a,' click-clack, open the handbag, 'a little candied trip?' __[gasps]__ 'A candied yum for me?' Yes, I will steal the handbag, push them over, run away. It's excellent.

#### DAVID

And that's how you treat people that you really, really love and respect. And...

#### TREXEL

Yes. How do _you_ treat people that you love and respect? By stealing from them. [__DAVID:__ Umm.] Because I love you so much because of the things you have. 'Thank you, push.'

#### DAVID

*(overlapping)* Mainly looking at videos and photos of him, and wishing I was there.

#### TREXEL

Is that why one of those screens has burned out? Have you played that over and over again so much that the screen has literally burned out [__DAVID:__ I just--] because of the power of __[David burbles]__ Bathin's chesty nipples?

#### DAVID

Couldn't keep up. Just couldn't keep up.

#### TREXEL

The pixels just can't keep up with the hunkiness of this duke.

#### DAVID

It cannot. And it did not. _And_ the Grand Mum's Guild greatest weakness is moths.

#### TREXEL

Why moths? Why do you think moths? [__DAVID:__ Well--] Moths aren't big. You could punch a moth. Bam. Moth gone.

#### DAVID

I think potentially they might eat--

#### TREXEL

Bees on the other hand! Now that's a formidable opponent. [__DAVID:__ I--] Get a bee in!

#### DAVID

We've already dealt with bees!

#### TREXEL

Oh, the bee's gone now.

#### DAVID

Well I don't know-- N-No, I mean, hopefully not. Hopefully not. Hopefully the... sad songs just made them feel a bit vulnerable and they got the therapy they needed.

#### TREXEL

Well, they've, they've socked off to their room at the least, so they're gonna be helpful to us. So, okay-- So, so why would moths be so dangerous to a Weaver's Guild?

#### DAVID

'Cause they eat... the cloth.

#### TREXEL

What, are you saying that moths sit down at a long table with a knife and fork and just a piece of cloth on the plate going, 'Mmm, yum yum yum, cloth for me, cloth for me, yum yum yum.'

#### DAVID

Well I suppose if they're particular elegant moths, then yes.

#### TREXEL

__[gasps]__ A race of hyper-elegant moths. And they look down upon you. You, you pick up a fork, and the moth is like, 'Is that the fork you're _sure_ you want to use?' You're like, 'No no no, no no, of course not. I'll use the one from the other side,' 'cause I-- It's probably either inside to out or outside to in. And you pick it up and they're like, __[laughs derisively]__ 'Wow, I, n-- I-- You know what, it's fine?' And then you realise _it's the soup course._ The soup spoon's at the top, you fool! And you feel really bad, so you stamp on 'em.

##### [David stammers]

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Don't shame Trexel at a dinner party. It always ends in stamping.

#### TREXEL

Is the threat __[burbles]__ we're facing? [__DAVID:__ Ye--] Poncy, poncy moths. [__DAVID:__ S....ure.] With their, with their, with their invented etiquette in order to distinguish new moth money from old moth money because they're losing their grip on the state.

#### DAVID

Ahhh... __[stammers]__ Yes. Yes. That'--

#### TREXEL

These moths! These moth rulers, you know, these moth bloodlines have been up there for too long with their old money and their old crumbling ho-- They have to let moths in just to tour around the gardens because the economic model has changed and they won't accept it.

#### DAVID

I just, I just really wanna just, just get into your brain. [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] And take the word 'moths' and pick it out, right? [__TREXEL:__ Okay?] Everything else you said, just pick out 'moths.' [__TREXEL:__ Yep.] And just pop 'The Board' in there.

#### TREXEL

The Board... is great. I don't know how-- Sorry, no, I tried, the, the Board, hey. The Board's entrenched power is... [__DAVID:__ Yes?] Fine, because that's the point. No, hang on. The Board, as an institution, runs our lives with no oversight and that is... like... a moth? No, I've got lost again, David. I've got lost. I've got lost.

##### [the room begins to rumble]

#### DAVID

It was a g-- It was a good try. Anyway, um, there is this kind of ominous rumbling starting, and we really haven't even written anything down yet, so I'm starting to get actually, genuinely, a little worried, that we're not gonna deliver the brief. [__TREXEL:__ Okay, okay.] And I don't know what's gonna happen if we go overdue. I think the table might eat us!

#### TREXEL

Speed round, speed round. We've got about one minute before we all die. [__DAVID:__ Okay.] So what we're going to do, is we're going to-- We're going to-- We're going to create a, a swarm of cardboard moths. [__DAVID:__ Okay!] So, what we do is we create this swarm of cardboard moths, and we, and we put it in a rocket and pack it in, and we fire it at the Weaver's Guild of the Grand Mum. [__DAVID:__ Yeah.] It explodes open, millions upon millions of moths all fly at them. Stellar Firma watching from over here is like, 'Yeah, I know the moths are the problem. We are just going to assume that the moths have taken care of business. We got other things to be going onto. We turn around and we continue our deep observation of Galactonium.' Meanwhile, the Weavers of the Grand Mum Guild are like, 'Oh no, moths! Wait a minute, it's cardboard. Maybe we should make a new cardboard line of woollen jumpers!' Everybody's happy.

#### DAVID

Okay. And how are we gonna convince Stellar Firma that cardboard moths are the right way to go?

#### TREXEL

I'm just gonna quickly go into IMOGEN, __[IMOGEN whirrs]__ uh, go to the page for 'Weavers of the Grand Mum Guild,' say, "Hey, do you know that cardboard moths are even more effective? Yep, they are." Enter, edited. __[IMOGEN screen powers down]__ Who's gonna check?

#### DAVID

I guess you're an executive, so you can do that.

##### [the rumbling persists, then gets louder]

#### TREXEL

I have got the privilege. I've got the power. And now I'm thinking that maybe that power and the lack over oversight is something that is great for me. Nearly, nearly that time, but not quite.

#### DAVID

__[sighs]__ Ahh, yeah, fine. But-- Okay-- Right-- It-- On the table. Okay. Grab onto something.

##### [the table opens and suctions up the brief while Trexel and David yell in frustration]

#### DAVID

This doesn't get better. It doesn-- [__TREXEL:__ No!] It gets worse, I think. It gets more scary every time.

#### TREXEL

You know what? I once, I once watched, uh, a holovid. It was an archive footage of the kinds of toilets you'd get on aeroplanes and trains back on old Earth. It's very similar to that. You press a button, it sort of goes 'gurgle gurgle gurgle,' and then it goes KER-CHUNK, as if you've really angered the toilet. Like that.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Given what you all do to toilets, it's hard not to see the anger is justified.

#### DAVID

Right. So this is just sort of a train toilet for information.

#### TREXEL

Yes. Or, plane toilet for information, either is fine.

#### DAVID

Okay, fine, a plane toilet for-- __[stammers]__ Okay, a transportation toilet for information.

#### TREXEL

Well, not on buses, David! Come on.

#### DAVID

Well, I don't know! Maybe there was toilets on buses. A-and also--

#### TREXEL

You could go to the toilet on a bus.

#### DAVID

Just to cover this-- What are "trains, [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] planes, [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] and buses?"

#### TREXEL

Okay. Trains are like planes, except they're on the ground, and [__DAVID:__ Okay.] planes are like trains, except they've got wings, [__DAVID:__ Sure.] and buses are like all of those things, except somebody's vomited on the floor.

#### DAVID

Okay, no, I think I've got it.

#### TREXEL

That's, that's about it. At least that's what we've been able to glean.

#### DAVID

Fair enough. Right. Um. Well, I mean-- We got the brief done, so, well done, and I guess it's, um, button time for Trexel?

#### TREXEL

__[burbles]__ Well, yes, David, but uh. I think we left a little bit, a little bit of something on the table. What's your plan?

#### DAVID

What?

#### TREXEL

Well, we're gonna have a revolution. What's the plan? How are we gonna get these guys? How are we gonna defeat them?

#### DAVID

Wh-- I, uh. Um. I just, I suppose I-- Well, I've not really been... worrying too much about that recently.

#### TREXEL

But, but you've always been worrying about it, David. Every, every day I've known you, you've been bleating on about the injustices because, you know, the, the unchecked power the Board has over you is in the same vein as the unchecked power the Board has over everyone, and I'm one of those people, so maybe I should... care about it. David, I think-- oh! David, I think it happened.

#### DAVID

Really?

#### TREXEL

David, I think I-- I think I've got _(like he's gagging on the word)_ perspec-- David, I think I've got __[honking like an unwell goose]__ perspeeeec-- __[clears throat]__ Now hang on a minute. David, I think I've got some _perspeeective_ on the situation which has allowed me to garner some... _(sounding out this very foreign word)_ sym...pa...thyyy.

#### DAVID

Um.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ I refuse to accept that you have gotten through to him. It simply cannot be the case.

#### TREXEL

I feel sick.

#### DAVID

I don't know what to do. [__TREXEL:__ I feel sick.] I d-- I don't know what to do.

#### TREXEL

I feel sick. I don't know what to do either. Just push the button. Just push the button and get rid of me! Okay, right right right!

##### [David and Trexel both burble in panic, before David hits the button]

#### TREXEL

Goodbye! __[yells as he drops through the tube]__

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Oh, David, what hath thou wrought.

#### DAVID

__[sighs]__ Um. Right. Okay. Uh, it happened, __[stammers]__ it finally happened, and... I need a plan. I need a plan. Or I could play some pinball. Ooh. I could play some pinball, and I *was* very close to my-- Okay, I'm gonna go and play some pi-- I'm, I'm just gonna play like, one to twenty games of pinball, a-and then I'll come up with a-- Yeah. F-f-fine. Okay. Okay. I'll do that.

##### [door whooshes open and the music of the lounge and pinball machine begin again]

#### PINBALL MACHINE

Tilt!
