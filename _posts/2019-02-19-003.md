##### [theme continues]

#### DAVID 

__[worried noises]__ There's only 21 minutes left. That blinking light is... blinking away and... that's the blink... of my demise...

##### [door swooshes open]

##### [Trexel enters the room groaning]

#### DAVID

Oh! Trexel! You're here! Right! We need to get to work! We've only got 20 minutes left!

#### TREXEL 

__[still groaning]__ Oh, David, you're so shrill...

#### DAVID

Yes!

#### TREXEL

Oh, you're so shrill, you're like a bell that's also an idiot.

#### DAVID

Oh, ding-ding-ding, it's time for work!

#### TREXEL

Please, please, David. I've-- [__DAVID:__ Wh--] I've got a very tender head right now.

#### DAVID

Actually, ding-ding-ding, seven and a half hours ago was time for work, but you're here now! So, we're gonna have to get on with it. Could you turn the lights on please?

#### TREXEL

David, the light is too bright. Can we not work in the dark?

#### DAVID

No, we can't work in the dark!

#### TREXEL 

__[sad groaning and sighing]__ Okay, okay.

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ Access granted.

#### TREXEL

There it is.

##### [bwoop of lights turning on]

#### DAVID

Right, okay, press the button!

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ Agh, my eyes!

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ Initiating.

#### TREXEL

Ohh, my ears!

#### DAVID

Right! Okay! So, our next client request is, __[Trexel groans]__ ummm, ah. So this is from Mitsy Van Schuten, the 4th wife to the President of the Mars Concordant. __[Trexel still groaning]__ Um, it's a planet dedicated to every adorable animal in existence-- you know, tigers, sharks, barracudas. Oh look at those adorable little fishy faces!

#### TREXEL

Who wrote this?

#### DAVID

S-somebody who, um, likes stream of consciousness. __[Trexel makes a disapproving noise]__ Yes, so it says they *must* have an interactive ride through each animal enclosure where you can get out and play with them!

#### TREXEL

Oh, Board dammit, must we? Must we continuously design these inane orbs for these fatuous fools?!

#### DAVID

Um, you *are* a planet designer, so, yes?

#### TREXEL

This isn't what I wanted, David. Turning up when it's already too late in the day after one too many drinks at the Cosmic Lounge to see *you,* sitting there bright eyed and bushy tailed, shrieking away that we need to make a... new planet for these... vapid fools!

#### DAVID

But we do! We've only got *about* 18 minutes left!

#### TREXEL 

_(contemptuously)_ I had dreams, David. I come from an incredibly prestigious line of planet builders. My ancestors were on the first ship off Earth. So I have *high* status here. And here I am, in this basement room. With *you*.

#### DAVID

Yes. And so that I don't *die*, we're going to have to build some planets because you are, as you've said, a professional planet builder!

#### TREXEL

Oh, woe is David. Oh, "I'm going to die unless you do the bare minimum of your job. Wah, wah, wah." *Fine*. Go on, what do you think we should do for-- who-- who was it?

#### DAVID

Uh, it was Mitsy Van Schuten, 4th wife to the President of the Mars Concordant.

#### TREXEL 

_(crosstalk)_ Mitsy Van-- something? Mitsy Van Schuten.

#### DAVID

I don't really know what the Mars Concordant is, but--

#### TREXEL

It's a large conglomeration of planets that agreed that they'll all meet on Mars once in a while so they don't have a war or something.

#### DAVID 

_(carefully)_ Right, so quite important then.

#### TREXEL

Well, relatively, I suppose. I'm not really a history buff.

#### DAVID

Influential, some might say.

#### TREXEL

Sure, sure. It's one of the most powerful trading blocs in the galaxy, yes.

#### DAVID

So, maybe if the wife of the president had a planet from us and she liked it, you might be--

#### TREXEL

David, shut up. David shut up, I've had an incredibly important idea.

#### DAVID

Yes?

#### TREXEL

The Mars Concordant is incredibly important. [__DAVID:__ Oh.] And I would like to be in their favor. [__DAVID:__ Right.] So maybe if I, *I*, Trexel Geistman, was to make an excellent planet for Mitsy, they'd like me, they'd back me and I'd get better deals.

#### DAVID

What a good idea, you, Trexel Geistman.

#### TREXEL

*God,* I am good. Okay come on, David. Davi-- __[faster]__ David! Come on, wake up. Wake up, David. Wake up. __[Trexel snaps his fingers]__

#### DAVID 

_(sarcastically)_ Yes. Yes, Trexel. Oh, I am now awake. You have encouraged me to become... more awake.

#### TREXEL

Good. Why are you stating obvious things? Come on, come on, move on. What do we want? What do we want to do?

#### DAVID

Not a clue. Um, right, so they want a planet dedicated to... every adorable animal in existence. [__TREXEL:__ Mm. Mm.] So, tigers, sharks, barracudas, things with adorable little fishy faces.

#### TREXEL

Got some-- got a lot of old Earth stuff on there. I think-- hang on, I've-- I-- I've got some files. Let's look at these.

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ Old Earth Geological Fact File.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

Sharks... Okay... and barracudas... Okay. What was the other one?

#### DAVID

A tiger?

#### TREXEL

A tiger. Ooh, that's different. That's on the land. Okay, well we can't do any of those. [__DAVID:__ Right.] They're *very* extinct, David. But we can make things that look pretty much like it. We can-- we can take animals, paint them... dress them up. Do that sort of thing.

#### DAVID

Okay. Right. And it says that the planet is... dedicated? To every adorable animal in existence? So not that... not-- not that they're there. It's just dedicated to them.

#### TREXEL

It's like a festival of hugs. [__DAVID:__ Yes.] A cavalcade of adorable eyes and wet noses and fluffy tails. Is that what they want?

#### DAVID

A sort of... theme park?

#### TREXEL

Look at it this picture of the shark. [__DAVID:__ Oh.] Yes, that's a *shark,* David. [__DAVID:__ Okay.] It's not got nice eyes, it's not got a nice tail, and it has got a lot of teeth.

#### DAVID

Well, they say here that apparently it has "an adorable little fishy face".

#### TREXEL

I suppose adorable little fishy face is in the eye of the beholder. Fine, okay. So, __[stutters]__ we're going to be making some sort of, like... shrine? To-- to the-- to animals? __[stutters]__ And something that celebrates them whilst also being a-- a park in which they dwell. Is-- is that what this idiot wants?

#### DAVID

Yes, they want a-- So, a planet that's dedicated to them, but *also* it *must* have an interactive ride through each animal enclosure where you can get out and play with them.

#### TREXEL

Right. So it's a theme park. [__DAVID:__ Yes.] I'm making a theme park planet.

#### DAVID

A theme planet.

#### TREXEL

A theme... planet.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL 

_(sarcastically)_ Right. Good.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Stellar Firma Ltd is pleased to remind you that employee enthusiasm is mandatory.

#### TREXEL

Okay. Fine, fine, fine! Okay, well, what size is this gonna be? Let's look at the chart. __[sighs]__

#### DAVID

How many-- how many cute animals are there?

#### TREXEL

There's gonna be lots. If it's going to be dedicated to every cute animal, all-- in existence, living or dead apparently, then it's gonna be a pretty big planet.

#### DAVID

Ooh, ooh, no! It didn't say "living or dead"!

#### TREXEL

No?

#### DAVID

Oh, but it did say "tigers and sharks and barracudas" and they're all dead.

#### TREXEL

Which are pretty dead.

#### DAVID

So is it only dead animals?

#### TREXEL

If it's gonna be an entire park full of dead animals, that's *not* gonna be cute, David. That's gonna be a charnel house.

#### DAVID

Oh. Maybe some alive ones then.

#### TREXEL

You know what? Let's make this for two purposes. It's one for us, and it's one for them. So we're gonna give them *exactly* what they want. To the letter. No complaints. This is what you wanted!

#### DAVID 

_(fearfully)_ Okay?

#### TREXEL

So, there are going to be *lots of* *dead* animals on this planet, David. [__DAVID:__ *(softly)* Right.] There are going to be piles and piles of them. Cute, lovely, *dead* animals. [__DAVID:__ Eugh...] As well as l-- cute, lovely, alive animals as well [__DAVID:__ Oh! Oh.] that you can play with and stroke. Because that's life, David. That's life. You can't have darkness without light, you can't have hugs without sorrow, you can't have whispering without _(yelling)_ *lots of shouting!*

#### DAVID

Right. So we could have a planet sort of in a-- sort of static orbit, maybe where the *light* side of the planet has all the *alive* animals, [__TREXEL:__ Hmm.] and then the *dark* side of the planet has all the *dead* animals. So it's some sort of, like, happy adorable theme park, and then also...

#### TREXEL

The dark, [__DAVID:__ The dark...] unlit, charnel house of death.

#### DAVID

Yes. You know, for all people!

#### TREXEL

I like it, David. You know what? And there-- there is something to be said for the macabre. People like scary holo-- holoshows. People like to be, like, scared when people jump out of things and go "boo!"

#### DAVID

Right!

#### TREXEL

So maybe they'll like half a dark planet full of corpses!

#### DAVID

Do we need them to jump out and go "boo"?

#### TREXEL

No. No, they're dead, David. They can't do that anymore. That's sort of the point.

#### DAVID

But-- but what if we s-- stapled them to *actors* who jumped out and went "boo"?

#### TREXEL

Oh my god, you're a genius, David! You're an absolute genius! Not only are they gonna be walking around mounds of mangled and decaying cute animal corpses, every now and again, one's going to stand up and say "How d'you do!" [__DAVID:__ Yes!] That's going to be really frightening!

#### DAVID

Like some sort of haunted... zoo.

#### TREXEL

Planet. Haunted zoo... haunted zoo...

#### DAVID 

_(crosstalk)_ Haunted zoo planet.

#### TREXEL

David, do you feel an advert coming on?

#### DAVID

Haunted zoo planet!

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ Roleplay holovision initiated.

##### [electronic powering on sound]

##### [Stellar Firma Ltd. theme playing in background]

#### TREXEL 

_(crosstalk)_ Welcome to the haunted zoo planet.

#### DAVID

Ooh!

#### TREXEL

Gasp as you see adorable animals in piles and piles of death.

#### DAVID

Ahh!

#### TREXEL

Gasp as one stands up and says, "Hello!"

#### DAVID

_(startled)_ Ahhh!

#### TREXEL

Calm down on the nice side of the planet where you hug a stoat or something.

#### DAVID

_(relaxed)_ Ahhh...

#### TREXEL

It's perfect, David! [__DAVID:__ Ah!] People will flock! People will flock!

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Roleplay holovision terminated.

##### [music ends, electronic powering off sound]

#### DAVID 

_(crosstalk)_ Great! Right! Lots of people! So... how are we going to get hold of all of these corpses?

#### TREXEL

Hmm. It's a good question, David. And also, it does bring up the good question of where do we get all of these *live* animals as well.

#### DAVID

Yes. Also you'd mentioned "land" and "not land".

#### TREXEL

Traditionally known as sea, David, or sometimes lake. [__DAVID:__ Ooo!] Could be a river! Let's have all of them.

#### DAVID

There's lots of not land. This is very confusing.

#### TREXEL

It's-- it's very complicated, David! Ge-- geoforming is one of the most important parts of our job. What. Are. You. Standing on. Is it wet? Is it dry? Is it dry but also moves? Is it wet but it's hard, like ice.

#### DAVID

Some sort of metallic foam right now.

#### TREXEL

Some sort of metallic foam right now. It's very absorbent on the foot. [__DAVID:__ Hmm.] So it's going to be incredibly important that we have a diverse range of biomes on this planet.

#### DAVID

Right, so we currently have The Four Biomes [__TREXEL:__ Mm-hmm], which is land--

#### TREXEL

Yup.

#### DAVID

--lakes--

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

--rivers--

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

--and sea. Those are the four biomes--

#### TREXEL 

_(crosstalk)_ Okay, I think-- I think there are more biomes than that, David.

#### DAVID

Are there?

#### TREXEL

Yes, because you've got hot land--

#### DAVID

Ooo!

#### TREXEL

--cold land--

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

--temperate land--

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

--land that's not that hot but there's no rain--

#### DAVID

Okay!

#### TREXEL

--land that there's *loads* of rain and it's really cold.

#### DAVID

Ooh.

#### TREXEL

Lakes: cold lakes, hot lakes--

#### DAVID

Huh?

#### TREXEL

--lakes that are really high-- Well, __[stutters]__ you see, the list goes *on*, David.

#### DAVID

Yes, but I'm pretty sure we need to get *all* of the things in that list, otherwise we're gonna miss some.

#### TREXEL

Okay, then you've got rivers. Slow ones.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Fast ones.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Ones that aren't that fast--

#### DAVID

'Kay.

#### TREXEL

--but they're quite, like, deep, and so if you get under them, then you get sucked away.

#### DAVID

Ooh!

#### TREXEL

Pebbly ones.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

Sandy ones. Ones where it's-- it looks nice, but actually has lots of sharp rocks just underneath. I think that's all the rivers. [__DAVID:__ Okay. Right.] Now, seas. *Really* salty. Oh, there's so much salt in the sea! Put your-- put your hand in? Oh, now you-- you've-- you've preserved your hand [__DAVID:__ Ooo!] and it just falls off. Then, another sea. No salt at all. Full of bacteria. Just out the-- out the wazoo. Just-- and nothing can live! Nothing can live in *either* of these seas. Too salty! I can't live in this! I not-- I'm not a fish that can-- that can live in this much salt. Oh! There's not enough salt. I'm not a lake fish, I'm a sea fish!

#### DAVID

Did a fish hurt you, Trexel?

#### TREXEL

I don't like fish. They're really *weird*. [__DAVID:__ Right.] You ever looked at a fish real close?

#### DAVID

No. I've not been out of this room.

#### TREXEL 

_(crosstalk)_ Don't-- H-hang on, I-- hang on, I've got one in my satchel. Hang on.

##### [unzipping sound]

#### DAVID

What? Why?

#### TREXEL

Here. Here, look. Look at this fish.

#### DAVID

Eugh!!

##### [wet flopping noises, David making sounds of disgust]

#### TREXEL

Yeah! Look at this!

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Fish detected. Security alerted.

#### TREXEL 

_(crosstalk)_ Go on, kiss it!

#### DAVID

*No!*

#### TREXEL

Exactly. __[kiss sound]__ You complete me.

##### [awkward silence]

#### DAVID 

_(unnerved)_ Okay...?

#### TREXEL

*Don't* look too heavily into my relationship with that fish.

##### [squeaking noise, zipping sound]

#### DAVID

I. Will. Not. So! It sounds like, in fact, there are just four biomes, but there are lots of different types of land [__TREXEL:__ Yes.], river, lake, and sea.

#### TREXEL

Yes. And it's gonna take absolutely *loads* of time to work them all out, David. So I-- You can't let anyone know about this. I've got a little bit of a work-around. We do have... some stock planets. _(conspiratorially)_ Sh-sh-sh-sh! Don't let anyone hear you say that. If it ever got out that we used and reused stock planets we would be in... absolute trouble. [__DAVID:__ Oh.] S-stop looking around David, it's-- it's more of an expression. Like, this room, it's-- it's-- it's a consultancy room, it's-- it's fine, if we-- if we're overheard. Obviously--

#### DAVID

Oh right. And-- and-- and the microphones?

#### TREXEL

Oh, well obviously that's for the Build Team. [__DAVID:__ Right.] And the Board, who will obviously be overseeing this-- but they don't mind. They don't mind. It's just that-- it's just that the clients can't know.

#### DAVID

Oh! The clients.

#### TREXEL

The clients can't know.

#### DAVID

Right. Okay.

#### TREXEL

So we can just use one of these, you know, pretty varied planets, and just pop some stuff on it. You know, planets all look the same, and, you know, maybe you-- you're looking at a planet, and you look at another planet and you think "Is that the same planet? I'm not entirely sure." Because they're all *orbs*, David. [__DAVID:__ Yes.] They're orbs with the furniture moved around.

#### DAVID

Right. Okay. Um, I mean, uh, and-- and *effectively* they just want a planet for every adorable animal in existence. [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] Which sounds, broadly, quite simple?

#### TREXEL

Broadly quite simple. Just get a really varied planet. [__DAVID:__ Sure.] The tricky bit-- the really *tricky* bit, David, is-- is-- is sourcing these animals. [__DAVID:__ Right.] I don't know if the people down in biology are gonna be able to-- to generate... facsimiles of pretty much every animal in existence, living or dead.

#### DAVID

Barracudas, tigers, [__TREXEL:__ Exactly] sharks, all of the other ones.

#### TREXEL

All of the other ones. Those three specifically don't live anymore. We have to make them from scratch. [__DAVID:__ Right.] And that seems like a *real hassle*, David.

#### DAVID

Okay. Do you think that these people *know* what tigers and sharks and barracudas look like?

#### TREXEL

Hmm. That's a g-- that's a *good* question David. They're not from Earth. They have no access to our history and our-- an-and our old animals. They just-- they just *heard* about these animals, you know, around and about, at parties or something, and they're just saying, "Ooh, I'd like one of them. I'd like one." It's like when people really think they know, like, a type of alcohol, and they're like, "Ooh, no, you have to have that one", and then you do a blind taste test and they're all like "Mmh, all of these are good!" and then everyone jumps out and says "Ha *ha*! You *idiot*, Trexel! You don't know anything about this type of alcohol! It's *all* the same alcohol, Trexel! Get out of the club! Get out and never come back!" ...You know when that happens to you?

#### DAVID 

_(sarcastically)_ I can imagine.

#### TREXEL

Hmm.

#### DAVID

*Right*. ...so, they don't know what the animals look like, which means you can get any kind of animal!

#### TREXEL

We can just get a large selection of animals, who's gonna check?

#### DAVID

Als-- also, is there some kind of-- *is* there, actually, some kind of centralised database in which every single animal in existence, adorable or not, has been catalogued?

#### TREXEL

Oh yes, it's all in IMOGEN. [__DAVID:__ Oh.] It's all in IMOGEN! Do you want to log in to IMOGEN? We'll log in to IMOGEN right now.

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ IMOGEN online.

#### DAVID 

_(crosstalk)_ Well, I mean, that is a problem then, because they can look at IMOGEN and know exactly how many of those animals we've covered, so we're going to have to cover... a lot of them.

#### TREXEL

IMOGEN is an internal system, David. [__DAVID:__ Oh...!] IMOGEN's for us. IMOGEN is *ours*.

#### DAVID

Is there an external one?

#### TREXEL

*No!* [__DAVID:__ Oh!] No! No, no, no, that would be like having an external trouser. It's just for you.

#### DAVID

...*Right.* __[pause]__ Do we *have* external trousers?

#### TREXEL

No, David, don't--

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ Legwear fact file.

#### TREXEL

You're getting really into this external thing. Do not have external trousers, David. You start having external trousers, you're gonna get external trouble.

#### DAVID

So I want some *internal* trousers.

#### TREXEL

You just want regular trousers, David. I don't know what's wrong with--

#### DAVID

Just trousers.

#### TREXEL

I don't know what's wrong with you, David. You're getting really, really focused on trousers.

#### DAVID

*I'm*-- I've-- I'm in just--

#### TREXEL

Take off your trousers, David. [__DAVID:__ No!] They're too distracting. Take them off! Take them off!

#### DAVID 

_(crosstalk)_ No! I-- I'm in a onesie! I'm in a onesie!

#### TREXEL

Oh, okay. Well, you know--

#### DAVID

It's kind of the thing that I was grown in. I'm not sure-- you come in in different onesies, but I have the same one!

#### TREXEL

Hmm. It's not very fashionable, is it, David?

#### DAVID

I don't think they made it to be fashionable...

#### TREXEL

Kind of just like-- kind of just like a, just like a grey.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Get a-- get a pinstripe. Ooh! Get *swirls*.

#### DAVID 

_(wistfully)_ You could bring me one of those onesies. I could wear your onesies.

#### TREXEL 

_(angrily)_ Don't *touch* my onesies. They're *mine*!

#### DAVID 

_(mournfully)_ Okay...

#### TREXEL

They make me look fashionable. They make me look *good* down at the Cosmic Lounge. So, next time you look at one of my onesies avariciously, think again! They're not for you!

#### DAVID 

_(meekly)_ Yes, Trexel.

#### TREXEL

They're for *me*!

#### DAVID 

_(meekly)_ Yes, Trexel.

#### TREXEL

Have we established that?

#### DAVID 

_(meekly)_ Yes, Trexel.

#### TREXEL

*My* onesies.

#### DAVID 

_(meekly)_ Yes.

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### DAVID 

_(meekly)_ Yes, Trexel. Sorry Trexel.

#### TREXEL

Right, so we'll just get a-- just a-- you know, a pretty *wide* selection of animals, you know, a-- a couple of the standards, maybe a couple of exotics, then we just *kill* half of them, pile them in big mounds, get a few actors __[stammers]__ to shuffle around [__DAVID:__ Yes.] and move them about a bit and-- and-- and bingo boingo, there's your planet!

#### DAVID

Right, yes, uh... I mean, th-- th-- they also, they want an "interactive ride" through--

#### TREXEL

Oh, I forgot about the *ride*, David!

#### DAVID

Through each animal enclosure.

#### TREXEL

Each-- Oh, they want them to be in enclo-- they don't just want them all sort of milling around?

#### DAVID

Or we could just put lots of fences up!

#### TREXEL

You know what? Just put up a-- This is a wonderful thing. It's called "painting a target around where you happen to hit". So you just *release* the animals. Give it a week. Let 'em *really mix*. Some will eat each other, some will get away. It'll be fine.

#### DAVID

Well, that'll make some of the dead animals!

#### TREXEL

Exactly! Then just start building fences. They'll-- they'll just naturally just shuffle themselves into roughly the right order, and then if anyone questions, you just say, "It's diversity. You're looking for a diverse biome here. That's why we've mixed them." Put up the fence, claim that's what you always meant to do.

#### DAVID

Right. And then we can *draw* some sort of... *line* [__TREXEL:__ Mm-hmm.] that people can... travel on. A travel line... [__TREXEL:__ Mm-hmm.] that they *get* on, in some capacity... and go around...

#### TREXEL

David, do you want a monorail? We can *make* a monorail, David.

#### DAVID

Monorail?

#### TREXEL

A monorail.

#### DAVID

Monorail!

#### TREXEL

Exactly! I've told you, it's a monorail!

#### DAVID

What is a monorail?

#### TREXEL

It's a singular rail with a carriage upon it that travels, and it always seems to go... *wooooshhhh*... [__DAVID:__ Ooo...] It never goes clunk or clank like a-- like a regular track or-- or rail line, it's always a... *wooooshhhh.*

#### DAVID

Right. That sounds *very* exciting.

#### TREXEL

They're *very* exciting, David. Every time you get on a monorail, even though it's basically like any other kind of train, it's *really* exciting.

#### DAVID

Ooh. So, we have a... monorail [__TREXEL:__ Mm-hmm.] that goes through each enclosure [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] and every so often we just stop it, let people out, [__TREXEL:__ Yeah.] and then they can get back in--

#### TREXEL

You can just stop it randomly as well. Again, paint the target around where you've hit. Just open the door and claim, "This is a stop."

#### DAVID

A Diverse Environmental Experience!

#### TREXEL

Ex-actly. Anyone questions it, it's because they don't like diverse environmental experiences and they're a monster.

#### DAVID

Right! Okay! Well, that sounds good! [__TREXEL:__ Wonderful.] So, we have: One of our stock planets that we found [__TREXEL:__ Mm-hmm.] that's kind of got a lot of stuff in it, and we just find a bunch of animals, dump them on, draw some fences, put in the monorail, bingo bango bongo, there is your planet!

#### TREXEL

Well, when you put it like that, David, it sounds like we've really half-assed this planet.

#### DAVID

Have we?

#### TREXEL

Yes, we absolutely have!

#### DAVID

Oh, no!

#### TREXEL

Well done! That's *exactly* what we want to do! Really *half* an a-- if you can give a *quarter* of an ass, that's even better! Just *really skim* it through the line.

#### DAVID

What-- d-- does that mean they're gonna like it?

#### TREXEL

Who knows, David? Who knows and who *cares*!

#### DAVID

*We* care!

#### TREXEL

Oh god, we care, David! Oh god, I forgot the fact that we *really care!* Okay, okay, okay, okay. We've got a couple of minutes left. We re-- we need to really put a, put a cherry on this weird rubbish cake.

#### DAVID

Okay! What do-- what do presidential wives like?

#### TREXEL

Um, um, um, um, um, p-power!

#### DAVID

Power?

#### TREXEL

Why would you marry a president if you didn't want some power?

#### DAVID

Okay, um... guns! Guns in the monorail so you can *shoot* the animals!

#### TREXEL

Yes! Yes! The power of life and death over everything that you see. It's not so much a monorail as a death-o-rail. [__DAVID:__ Yes.] You open the window, you *shoot* indiscriminately into a herd of wilde-things, and then you just *laugh.* You just *laugh* as the blood flows around you.

#### DAVID

Yes! And then on the other side of the planet, you have a *life* gun! [__TREXEL:__ Yes!] And you find a bunch of tiger corpses, and you just *shoot* them, and they come back to life, and you laugh because they have to exist [__TREXEL:__ Exactly!] as this terrible thing, and they'll just die eventually!

#### TREXEL

They don't want to be alive! Their souls have gone [__DAVID:__ Exactly!] and yet here they are!

#### DAVID 

_(frantically)_ Trapped! In an enclosure! On their own! In the dark!

#### TREXEL

Excellent, David. You know what? You know what powerful people want? To be *God.* And that's what we've made them. Now, it's really not important that we have to make some sort of life gun. The people down in Biotech can really just sort that out for us.

#### DAVID

Right. Okay.

#### TREXEL

Good save, David. Good save. _(chuckling)_ I was really worried there for a moment but you've really pulled that back with the whole "let's make them a god" thing. Ooh, oh, David, David, we're running out of time.

#### DAVID

Okay, right, yup, run run run run run run run.

#### IMOGEN 

*(crosstalk)* __[beep]__ Would you like to submit? __[chime, pneumatic tube hissing]__ Submitting.

##### [Trexel and David sigh in relief]

#### TREXEL

There it goes. There it goes.

#### DAVID

Do you think that was a good one?

#### TREXEL

David, I have absolutely no idea if that was a good one. [__DAVID:__ Oh.] It-- it felt good, it felt good coming out, but uh... once I've sat with it for a while, who could say? But hey, what are the stakes, other than my future career and your continued life. __[laughs contentedly]__

#### DAVID 

_(skeptically)_ Yes...

#### TREXEL

Ahhh, dear. You know I-- I've enjoyed today, David. I really have. I haven't enjoyed my job in quite a long time, and it's-- it's nice to, you know, come into the office, twenty minutes before we need to shut and, you know, really just-- really just *jam* out a planet with someone.

#### DAVID

Could you-- if you enjoyed it so much maybe come in a little...earlier tomorrow?

#### TREXEL

David, I have a lot to do. You know? This isn't all I have. Yes, this is my job, *yes* it's what I'm supposed to do, *yes* it's incredibly important for my future life that I do well, but I *really* have a lot of sitting.

#### DAVID

You also mentioned a lot about your... legacy and, and history of your family, it's very important to them, [__TREXEL:__ Sure] so maybe you should spend some time...? On it...? __[voice pitching up and cracking]__ And also? I'd like to live...?

#### TREXEL

I'll have a think about it, David. I'll have a think. But I've got an appointment with Jonny down at the Cosmic Lounge. [__DAVID:__ Right...] So uh, I'll see you later. [__DAVID:__ Um...] Bye now!

##### [door swooshes closed]

#### DAVID 

_(sadly)_ Bye... Ohhh. Right. _(more cheerfully)_ Well maybe he'll be in earlier tomorrow. I hope...

##### [door swooshes open]

#### TREXEL

David, just wanted to pop back to say [__DAVID:__ Ah! Uh...] I'm absolutely not going to be early tomorrow. [__DAVID:__ Ah! Ohh.] Bye bye!

##### [door swooshes closed]

#### DAVID

Oh. Okay. Uh. Oh! Oh, he's left the IMOGEN terminal on.
