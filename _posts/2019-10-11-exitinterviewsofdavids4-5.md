#### MALE ROBOT VOICE

David 4.

__[electronic activation sound]__

#### TREXEL

Okay, I've-- I've got it this time, I've got it. Okay. David 4, we are at... a little exit interview, just to really establish why it is that you're being recycled quite so quickly.

#### DAVID 4

Um, sorry, who are you?

#### TREXEL

Ah. This is part of my point. My name is Trexel Geistman, and--

#### DAVID 4

Ooh! Trexel Geistman. I'm supposed to be working for you. Very good to meet you, Trexel Geistman, I'm David 4.

#### TREXEL [crosstalk]

I'm gonna stop you there. No, gonna stop you there, David. Gonna stop you there, David.

#### DAVID 4

Uhh... Okay.

#### TREXEL

I'm aware of all this, unfortunately, __[stutters]__ you're really scheduled to be recycled. It seems a bit soon, you haven't had a chance to get going, but it will make sense in the grand arc of history. You see, I've been having a bit of a problem, with my... consultant... and clone relationships being quite, how do you put it, *short*. Um, and I thought this time, just take myself *completely* out of the equation. So, I just didn't turn up for work at all. Therefore there could not possibly be any influence on me as to why the work wasn't done! So, we have to conclude from that that you, David 4, are completely in the wrong and at fault for your own recycling! There!

#### DAVID 4

...So you're saying that you solved the problem of work not being done by... not appearing for work?

#### TREXEL

In its simplicity... there is its elegance!

#### DAVID 4

I'm... I'm sorry, Trexel, I'm not... sure I understand.

#### TREXEL

Look, it's very simple. It can't be my fault if I wasn't there!

#### DAVID 4

But you need to do the work.

#### TREXEL

No, *we* need to do the work-- I-- hang on, no, you see, because you're h-- and I-- __[pause]__ You can't actually get access to the briefs when I'm not there, can you?

#### DAVID 4

No. And also, I'm programmed just to do exactly what you say and write down your notes. That is my function as a clone. If you would like to get on with work, then I would be happy to... get to designing planets! __[pause]__ Would you like to design a planet?

#### TREXEL

...Interview terminated.

__[electronic powering-down sound]__

__[activation beep]__

#### MALE ROBOT VOICE

David 5.

__[electronic activation sound]__

#### TREXEL

I just... I just don't know what to do, David. __[sniffles]__ I just-- it's happening again! I-- I don't know what to do.

#### DAVID 5

Oh, um, you just need to press that button there, and that will--

#### TREXEL

__[snapping]__ No, no, I *know* how to recycle someone, David! That's not the point. I just... you don't understand how hard this is for me. I-I sit here... and a new clone like yourself--

#### DAVID 5

Hello!

#### TREXEL

--rocks up. Sits down in the chair. Just starts getting to know them, and... ignoring their needs and all of a sudden! __[laughing mirthlessly]__ Performance isn't good enough, and it's time to pop them in the ol' Slurrinator.

#### DAVID 5

Oh... don't worry, Trexel! David 6 will arrive. Un-- unless the series is discontinued for repeated failure to deliver. Uh, but then somebody else will arrive. Maybe a... Kenneth. Or, um... an Amrish, or a-- or an Eileen, or... well, anyone else! It's fine. Somebody else will arrive.

#### TREXEL

But it'll happen again, David.

#### DAVID 5

And again and again and again, but it doesn't matter. Stellar Firma always has a clone.

#### TREXEL

Stellar Firma always has a clone.

#### DAVID 5

And indeed, you've gotten through upwards of 762 clones over the past year.

#### TREXEL

That's more than one a week, David! That's more than one a week in the Stellar Firma annual branded cycle.

#### DAVID 5 [quietly]

Yes. Well, they always have more, so don't worry. What you need to do to remember is you tried. When you did turn up, those... three and a half hours we spent together, you really tried. So, don't worry about old David 5. I'm going off to the giant blender in the sky.

#### TREXEL

Oh, well, no, it's actually under your chair-- look, I'll show you.

__[static buzz]__

#### IMOGEN

Recycling process: commencing!

__[alarm begins buzzing, David 5 hums quizzically] [mechanical whirrs and hums commence]__

#### DAVID 5

Ah! O-okay, then.

__[a high-pitched whirring sound then a pause, muffled blending sounds followed by something liquid and heavy being dispensed and a distant thud.]__

#### TREXEL

__[shakily]__ Well... there goes another one. Well done, Geistman. There goes another clone, right into the blender! So, let's just... __[sighs]__ This can't go on. I can't keep... building myself up like this. Falling, failing, and... *feeling*. No, there'll be more Davids. There'll be a David 6, and then, who knows? Maybe even a David 7. But I'm not going to let them hurt me any more. This isn't *my* fault. This is theirs! It's *their* fault for failing, s-somehow, it's not important! __[pause]__ But I'll be strong. And I have a feeling that one day, everything will... come up Geistman. __[shaky breath]__ Interview terminated.
