#### Neurodivergent Creatives Stream - Collaboration with Every Brain and Do It Ourselves

Hosted by Erin Enfys and Amy Dickinson

Originally streamed live 22nd April 2021

#### ERIN

Um, I'm muted. There we go.

Hello, we are live. Ah, my goodness, how exciting. How exciting to see so many of you here! Hello, just checking the audio is fine on my end.

Welcome. Give us a-- Ahh, hello chat! __[laughs]__ It's such a pleasure to see all of you here. Audio's good. Thank you so much.

So, obviously, this is something that's really, really special to me and Amy today, and we just wanna say thank you, first of all, for being here. We're joined by the absolutely amazing team from Every Brain, who are based up in Manchester, and we are so excited to collaborate with them, me and Amy from Do It Ourselves, on this project.

So, if you are from Do It Ourselves or from Every Brain, a little introduction to me, I'm an artist and -- gosh, what am I? -- an artist and a streamer and an activist and I stream here on the themes of queerness and neurodivergence and creativity and disability, and I'm here with Amy from Do It Ourselves who has very generously let us use her Chronic Chillness slot to run this consultation... consultation chat? Yeah, consultation sounds a bit formal, doesn't it? Amy is a streamer and does amazing work on creating inclusive spaces for dynamically disabled, neurodivergent, chronically ill people, and I will let her introduce herself, probably a little bit better, in a minute as well.

Did you want to say the thing about Chronic Chillness? Do you wanna fire away?

#### AMY

Yeah, sure. So for anyone who's here who's normally in Chronic Chillness and maybe hasn't been on Erin streams before -- I'm sure you were all aware that we were doing this, we've been screaming about it for weeks.

#### ERIN

Mm-hmm.

#### AMY

But just a reminder that this isn't a normal Chronic Chillness session, and we're running till 10 o'clock today, whereas normally we're finished by nine on Chronic Chillness, just so that you're all aware of that.

#### ERIN

Yeah.

#### AMY

I have still remembered to do my pillbox and my mouth guard, which you all know are my Thursday things, so if it's part of your routine and you need to do your health admin while we're here and we're chatting, please, please do do that. I don't want you all to go to take your meds tonight and realise you've not got them because you've not filled up your pillbox. I see that Jarett. __[laughs]__ So feel free to do it as we're talking and still chip-in in the chat like you normally do, but I will not be talking much today. You know how much I love talking. __[Erin laughs]__ But I will actually be being quiet most of the time, and I will leave it to the lovely people from Every Brain to do the talking.

#### ERIN

Some people in the chat have mentioned that the captioner is really good. That's because we're on Zoom, so we're using Zoom's captioning feature today. I think you've all been a bit-- Well, I don't think-- I was about to say you haven't been spoiled, you've been reversed-spoiled by our usual captioning feature, haven't you, because it is absolutely terrible. Obviously, it's better than nothing. But yeah, today we're using Zoom's transcript service, and that's great as well 'cause then we can save it and we can have it ready for you afterwards as well. So that's really exciting.

I'm going to let Every Brain folks introduce themselves very briefly. So fire away.

#### ALI

Yeah, sure. Thank you so much. Hi everybody. It's my first time on Twitch, so I am __[chuckles]__ just reacting to it.

Yeah, my name is Ali. I'm an arts producer based in Manchester, and I am currently leading a project called Every Brain, which is, at the minute, building a guide for theatres and cultural organisations on how they can better support neurodiversity. What that means is we're trying to make a document, essentially, that tells theatres and orgs exactly things that they can do to make our experience working with them and being in their venues, if they have a venue, better and more friendly to our various ways of thinking and being and practicing and doing.

So that's one of the things that I do as a person with ADHD, and I'm gonna invite my really good friends, Toni and Lucy, to also introduce themselves. Ladies, go ahead.

#### LUCY

I love how we're just volunteering for each other here. It's great. I'm Lucy. I am a Community Arts practitioner and producer in Manchester. I'm working with Ali and Toni on the Every Brain project, and I'm one of their community champions. I love this project because I'm dyspraxic and I have OCD, and I just want more arts venues to be better at supporting people in the workplace to thrive rather than just letting us do our own thing and not knowing what to do really. So, yeah.

Toni, go.

#### TONI

I'mma going. Hi everyone, I'm Toni-Dee. My pronouns are she or they. I am an artist facilitator, someone who is usually a thinker in the room for arts projects, which encompasses lots of different roles, really. A lot of that is to do with support. I am an artist that makes work about queerness, race, disability, usually not in theatres, actually. Usually I make work that is responsive to environment, so I'm used to working in places like refugee centres, cemeteries--

#### ERIN

Awesome.

#### TONI

--back of pubs. Yeah, everywhere that's not a formal venue, really, which is really exciting. But I also am an access assistant, and part of that is shaping care and wellbeing for the team that I work with. Yeah, so I've spent the last two years looking after people, basically, in the arts. I'm doing the same job as Lucy on Every Brain. I'm a community champion, which at the time I was kind of like, 'I wonder what that means as a title', but I guess it means trying to encourage people to speak freely about their experiences of neurodiversity and feel comfortable enough to maybe express ways in which we can all do better for each other 'cause I'm really interested in the ways that neurodiversity is different for different people, and that means maybe some access needs don't provide space for another one, but how can we add better provide spaces for all of us to live better.

So, um, yeah, that's me

#### ERIN

Amazing. So amazing. I mean, we've only just met Lucy and Toni. We've met Ali a few times, obviously, getting this all set up, so I hadn't heard any of that before. That is so cool. How exciting! And all the chat is saying as well, like, 'That's so cool', 'That sounds awesome', 'Whoa, awesome', 'What a lovely group of people doing lovely things.' Thank you so much folks. You're so sweet.

If you are new here or even if you're not, then please do put in the chat where you're checking in from. And if you wanna share a diagnosis or a bit about yourself, or if you don't have a diagnosis, everyone is valid here, then please do go ahead and let us know just a little bit more about you.

Today we're gonna be focusing quite a lot on the neurodivergent experience, as Every Brain have told us, and even if you're not somebody who interacts with theatres, arts venues, cultural organisations on a regular basis, we still wanna know how you still wanna be spoken to, treated, cared for. Don't feel like, 'Oh, I'm not an artist or I'm not a commissioned whatever or--' __[blows raspberries]__ We don't want that. Don't worry about that at all. We want to know how you wanna be treated, basically, when it all boils down to it.

I was gonna say-- La la la la, oh, we've done with that. Okay, fine. I've got a little guideline of where we're going 'cause we've just got so much to cover, so I've literally just got a script in front of me like, 'Let's make sure that these folks get everything in.'

Yeah, so basically what Every Brain is doing is, as Ali rightfully said, is creating this guide for organisations. And I'm just so honoured to be a part of that. You know, I was an actor before I was an Erin __[chuckles]__ and this project is really close to my heart, so I'm really glad that we're collaborating on this today.

I wanted to kick off the discussion, if you like, with the thought "what does the world need to know about neurodiversity?" What do people need to know?

Amy's got Hippo with her. Great. We're starting strong. Excellent. Got some lovely introductions in the chat. Happy to open that up to the floor. As in the Zoom floor, and also the chat floor.

#### ALI

I think what the world needs to know about neurodiversity is-- I think, firstly, the world needs to understand what neurodiversity means and what neurodivergency means, because they are two different things that talk about different things. I also think the world needs to understand that neurodiversity is part of biology, like the world just actually can't exist without it. And so, why we live in a world where we're not prepared to flexibly adapt to the various ways that we are as people is a really limited way of doing stuff. I think that we need to change that 'round. Basically, that's what the world needs to know.

#### ERIN

I love that.

#### LUCY

I think that the world needs to know that neurodiversity is a superpower and that different ways of thinking about things are an asset to just society in general, because if you can't-- Some people think in straight lines, but some people think laterally, and lateral thinking is good because it's not things that other people have necessarily contemplated, and it just provides a different way of doing things, and if we all did everything the same way, we'd probably never get anything done.

#### ERIN

I agree wholeheartedly. I wonder what-- I'm just keeping an eye on chat to see what chat thinks.

What do you think the world needs to know about neurodiversity, Toni? I love listening to you talk, and it looks like you've got something to say. Tell us.

#### TONI

I always have something to say.

#### ERIN

I love listening to you talk! I wanna listen to you talk all day.

#### TONI

Always. Good. That's good. So I think the key thing for me thinking about neurodiversity is actually a sort of wider conversation about how when you accommodate people that everyone else is accommodated too, right? In the same sort of vein as if you look after the most marginalised people in society everyone benefits from that. Everyone benefits from us championing each other. Actually, if we make space for lots of different types of thinking, everyone is better off for that actually. Your organisations are more exciting, they're more accessible, and folks maybe who haven't identified themselves as neurodivergent or know that maybe they have that superpower, as Lucy so brilliantly put it, feel more comfortable being able to say, 'You know, actually, I think a little bit like that', or oh-- I know that happened to me. I was like, 'I don't have ADHD', __[Erin chuckles]__ and then after like a year I was like, 'Oh, I think that might be the case.'

#### ERIN

Me too. Yeah. __[laughs]__

#### TONI

And that was through having all the divergent people around me who were able to be like, 'Mate, it's fine. It's absolutely fine', but actually that isn't the typical-- I mean more of us are neurodivergent than we think, you know? We're not in a minority, actually, so that for me is the thing that feels important.

#### ERIN

Oh, lush. Yeah, absolutely. I'm just giggling at the chat. Someone's in the chat--

#### AMY

Loads of stuff in the chat now.

#### ERIN

Yeah, TaziH3ro says: "Thinking outside of the box, under the box, nowhere near the box. I like it." And then Andy said underneath: "What's a box?"

##### [laughter]

#### AMY

And then Taz replied: "It could be a pyramid." __[chuckles]__

Alex has said: "I'd like people to understand that it doesn't mean we're broken, just slightly different!"

EvaRose agreeing: "That's exactly it: DIVERSE. Each person is different. There isn't a 'one-size-fits-all' fix for things. It's about general inclusivity and accessibility for everyone."

Matty: "I think people should know that a lot of people are neurodivergent and can have strengths and challenges and support requirements!"

#### ERIN

I just wanted to highlight the fact that this is obviously -- 'cause we're collaborating with, you know, three different brands or communities if you like -- there's a lot more messages in chat than there normally are, which is why we also have an increased amount of mods. So if you say something and you think, 'Oh, they haven't mentioned it or they haven't noticed it', because we're checking on chat all the time, it just might be that we just physically don't have the time to read every single thing like we normally would in chat. So if there was anything that you would like to add and you think is super important -- I mean, everything is super valuable and super important -- and you want to add it, then Every Brain's producer, Amanda, is currently tweeting on -- I was gonna say tweeting on Twitch -- tweeting on "tweetch"-- tweeting on Twitter on the hashtag-- Was it Every Brain Twitch, Ali?

#### ALI

Yeah, the hashtag #EveryBrainTwitch with a capitalised letter at the beginning.

#### AMY

So we need to introduce Every Brain to an element of Twitch streaming now which is that the people in chat can use their channel points, which they get for watching, to redeem things to make us look after ourselves.

#### ERIN

Oh yeah, I've got a posture check. __[stretches]__

#### AMY

So, we've had a posture check, which basically means we all need to check whether we're sitting comfortably, whether you need to stretch. It's a good reminder that we all need to look after ourselves 'cause, you know, I don't like sitting up for 90 minutes. I wouldn't normally do that, but we do that on a stream.

#### ERIN

Mm. Mm. Absolutely.

All right, we're gonna move on to our next point of discussion, if you like. Being neurodivergent can sometimes mean that you're particularly skilled at certain things, for example, multitasking or problem solving. What neurodivergent superpowers do you have?

Let's maybe take one quick one from each of us and then let's hear from the chat. Ali, what's your neurodivergent superpower?

#### ALI

I can move from one task to another without much problem. And sometimes that's like, I can go from brushing my teeth straight into an email or it means I can go from eating a cheese toastie straight into eatin' soup, but it's just like an ease, an ease.

#### ERIN

Awesome. I love that. Mine-- Oh, I don't know, actually. I kinda have to think about mine for a bit longer. Lucy, what's yours?

#### LUCY

Mine is problem solving, because that's about lateral thinking/ honeycomb pattern. I am not a straight line. So I just think of loads of stuff that nobody else has thought of. I might go down a bit of a rabbit hole sometimes but, you know, it's all good and I'm very, very good at research as well.

#### ERIN

Amazing. Chat has said, "I think having--" jaretthowarth says: "Tbh I think having a funky gender is a superpower." Yes, I've seen some studies recently there's a very, very high comorbidity with people who are neurodivergent and people who are gender non-conforming. And I mean, that could be a whole different stream in itself. I'd love to talk about it, but I think that's really cool. That's definitely one of mine. I'm a they/them.

Also, stalking people online, I'm really good at. You give me a first name and maybe a hair colour, and I've got 'em. I've got 'em. Or maybe that's just a Leo thing, I don't know.

Or organising things. Yeah, I can see things on a shelf and I'm just like, __[mimes organising shelf]__. Like, I reorganised the freezer today in about 30 seconds and my partner was like, 'How did you do that?' and I was like, 'I don't know. How didn't you do that? It was a mess, so I just walked in I was like, "This needs to be done."'

Toni, look at your gorgeous smile. My goodness. __[chuckles]__

#### TONI

Listen, I am incredibly womby today. Don't make me cry, 'kay? Compliments *will* make me cry.

I think probably my empathy, which isn't something that I necessarily thought was about my neurodivergency but is. And it's probably the reason that I can work with kids so well, because I'm able to hone in on maybe like an emotional thread in a room where people cannot, and it makes me hype-- it means I'm hypersensitive but in a way that I think is good. __[chuckles]__

#### ERIN

Oh, I really feel that. I cried today because my partner reminded-- well, I reminded myself of a story my partner told me where a Roomba escaped from the house that it was living in and tried to hoover up the whole world, and I just felt really sad 'cause I was like, 'I feel really bad for the Roomba 'cause it will never manage to clean the whole world and it's lost its family.' And, yeah, so I really feel that hypersensitivity thing. Yeah, don't cry, Toni. It's alright. We're gonna get through this together.

Amy, what's chat saying, and also what's your superpower?

#### AMY

There's lots of stuff in chat about hyper-empathy and it's actually reminding me of the Do It Ourselves stream we had on Monday 'cause we were talking about the differences between hyper-empathy and actually being able to put emotions to one side and really focus on solving a task in an analytical way, and how neither of those is right or wrong, or a correct representation or not. They're just different ways of working, and it helps us if we know those things 'cause we can find what works for us better.

Lots of talk about games that people are good at, like logic games that people are good at.

#### ERIN

Yeah.

#### AMY

And also, there was something earlier. I'm just gonna scroll back a little bit 'cause I don't wanna miss people who were-- Oh, Rhys. Rhys said: "My artistic brain connects things in a really cool way." Um... Oh, stupid scroll. Nope, lost it now. I've lost it on the scroll. But yeah, being able to be creative in a different way is definitely helpful. For me, I mean, I'm not even sure if it's related to a kind of neurodivergence... symptoms or not, but I think my superpower in life generally related to having chronic illness health issues and potentially some neurodivergent traits is that I know what's wrong with me, regardless of whether a doctor does or not. I feel like that's a pretty good superpower, knowing yourself, and knowing what you need, regardless of what medical professionals say sometimes.

#### ERIN

EvaRoseGames has just said something, and I wanted to jump in on it before it disappears up my window but EvaRoseGames says: "Yeah I'd agree! The fact I don't know my *own* personality (due to the BPD) means that I'm GREAT at picking up on others' emotions and giving them to myself and portraying them in a character, making me a better actor!" That's super interesting! Ooooh, yeah.

#### AMY

I really apologise for not muting myself before I drank that. I thought I was on mute.

#### ERIN

Oh, that's alright. Don't worry, I do that all the time. Just yell at me if I, you know-- All the time in my streams people are like, 'Erin, you're muted. Erin, your captions are muted but you're not muted' or like, you know. So feel free to yell at me.

Also, they're making each other cry in the chat? Please don't make each other cry. I mean, for good reasons, sure, why not?

#### AMY

Someone said they could cry on command. Oh, it was Rhys. "I can cry on command! Hyper-empathy makes me better at acting."

#### ERIN

Yeah, I just gotta think about Roombas and I'm off.

#### AMY

Jarett said: "Identifying with robots is also super cool."

wildhorse6 has said: "My logical side is really good for making theories", and I've definitely noticed that within fan communities that some of the amazing fan fictions and things that come out, bringing theories out of little tidbits that people have said in an episode is great.

#### ALI

Yeah, just off the back of that from wildhorse6, today I was running a workshop with some young autistic people, and one of them, this lad, he's really into *Doctor Who*, and given the opportunity, he could have filled the 90-minute workshop just with a monologue about from the first Doctor to now. He just streams information.

#### ERIN

Uh-oh, you said the magic word. Chats like, 'Uh, did someone say *Doctor Who*?'

##### [laughter]

#### ALI

Amazing! It's all kicking off in here.

He just is a walking encyclopaedia of the Doctors, and it's really great to be around because I think I could just sit and listen to you for 90 minutes. I'm getting paid to be here but this lad, you know, he can run the workshop.

#### ERIN

And I think-- We're talking about all these things that we enjoy, but how do other people benefit from that? Like, how does society benefit from these things for us? 'Cause like, 'Oh yeah, I love organising a shelf', it's just like cool, like, how does that benefit someone else? And obviously, that's quite an obvious one. Like, I'm really good at organising shelves and boxes and freezer drawers and that kind of stuff, and that's really good domestically, but how does that benefit me in maybe a workplace setting or in a social setting?

Like, I used to always-- people would never wanna to do the archiving jobs. I did loads of internships in theatres and production assistant work and all that kind of stuff pre-disability, and everyone was like, 'Oh, we gotta go down to the cellar and do some archiving', and I was just like, 'Ooh! Yes yes! Mm, yes! Me! Gimme gimme gimme!', and I would just go down there, put my ear defenders on and a podcast in and just organised boxes-- Oops, sorry. Just turned my mic off. Organised boxes all day and, like, it was a dream. And I was the only one who wanted to do that.

And I also used to work front of house in the theatre when I was a student and, oddly enough, considering we were all drama students and stuff, no one ever really wanted to sit in and watch the plays, but because I was hyper fixated on musicals, I was like, 'I will go and watch all of the musicals', whereas all the ushers and things wanted to see the comedy and the, you know, the cool stuff. I was like, 'I would love to go and watch the Student Union's production of *Spring Awakening*. Thank you.' Because it was very much my hyperfixation. So yeah, how does it benefit-- it benefits us but how does it benefit other people?

#### AMY

I'm gonna give an example of my lovely mods because I have said before that I would not be able to run Do It Ourselves myself without the mod help. I mean, Matty instantly 'I'm gonna make a Carrd website', and it's linked to everything, and all the information from streams and stuff is on there. I would have hated doing that task, and I would have done it badly and Matty's done it amazingly. And Matty's just put: "Yeah, I've hyper-fixated on DIO" in chat. __[laughs]__ And the same with Andrew. I'm not sure Andrew if you described yourself as having hyper-empathy, but the amount of times you've checked in on me since I injured myself the other day, and always sort of keeping that in mind, I've definitely noticed those is really good traits that have helped me run Do It Ourselves since we started back in July.

#### ERIN

jackaljaybird has said something really lovely. Have you noticed this--? Oh, if I'm cutting you off Amy just tell me.

#### AMY

Sorry, I was just gonna say, and also, with it being online as well, I feel like we've managed better than maybe we would have if it had been a whole team of neurotypicals trying to do everything online.

#### ERIN

jackaljaybird has said: "My ADHD makes it really easy to make connections or spitball ideas in design meetings and come up with things the design team wouldn't otherwise."

I run a Facebook group called Neurodivergent Improvisers and the tagline for it is "A Different Obvious". So they always say when you're in improv, you go for the obvious thing. Never try to be too clever. Don't try and think of the joke. Just say the obvious thing that comes out. But one of the things I really enjoy about improvising and making up comedy with neurodivergent people is that their obvious is often so different from neurotypical obvious, if you like. Just yeah, I love that. A different obvious. It's my fav.

Anyway, I'm gonna let other people talk. __[chuckles]__

#### ALI

I think, on that point Erin, really importantly, often I think one thing that anybody who's neurodivergent brings to a conversation or to a project or just to the table in general is just sometimes it's a different viewpoint, kind of like looking at the problem from a slightly different angle and in some cases that is a really clear and easy solution to the problem, or it's really innovative way of doing the thing that they're all trying to do. Certainly my experience sometimes is like I join a conversation and there's a plan in action, and my interpretation of it is like, 'Well, that's great but I also wonder if you could do it this way' and it's just me cutting a load of different red tape just to get to the action. I think that comes from my ability to think super, super quick that other people don't have, and certainly when I've been in meetings where we'll have been there for like three hours talking about blah blah blah and then somebody walks in who is a neurodivergent and they solve it in a minute. It's absolutely magic.

#### LUCY

Like I said before, problem solving. I think a lot of us have that capability too, just because we don't think in a necessary-- Well, not everybody thinks in a linear way. So, yeah, I think that's a huge one and again the hyper-empathy, I think. I feel like I can put myself in other people's shoes a lot better if just because I've been in different situations because of being neurodiverse as well.

#### ERIN

Lovely. I just noticed that Toni's turned her camera off, and I think she said that she had an Asda delivery coming, so when she comes back, I'm very excited to hear about how it went. I think it was Ryan was delivering her Asda delivery. Okay, cool. We have to find out how Ryan did.

#### ALI

Yeah. And he was late by the way.

#### ERIN

__[gasps]__ Ryan! You naughty boy.

#### AMY

Forty-two people on Twitch are all saying 'Hi Ryan. Do better.'

#### ERIN

*(chuckling)* Shake my head, Ryan. God's sake.

Front of house gang. Matty--

#### AMY

There's a few--

#### ERIN

Oh, yeah.

#### AMY

Yeah, a few messages in chat.

#### ERIN

Go for it.

#### AMY

Someone earlier said about-- Let me scroll up to it. So it was... SatyrnsMoon: "I think my skill at visually organising and noticing visual differences is super helpful at my job."

jackaljaybird: "my ADHD--"

I hate the scroll. It drives me--

#### ERIN

It's alright. I read the one from jackaljaybird. That was the one that I read out.

#### AMY

Oh good. Okay, that's fine.

People saying things around being able to listen, it making you a really good listener 'cause you're really interested in people explaining all the details about something.

flamango42 has said: "Front of house gang!! I did it during a panto and I watched it like five times and loved it every time, it made me better at it as well 'cause I knew when people were likely to leave and when the actors were gonna come through the audience and how those interacted."

#### ERIN

Nice.

#### AMY

Matty said: "Something that I like about being neurodivergent too is the Passion!!! So many big emotions and unapologetic LOVE and JOY! And the sense of justice and being very principled!"

#### ERIN

Yes!

#### AMY

Matty's really good at explaining things as well.

#### ERIN

He is. Yeah.

TaziH3ro says: "I feel like neurodivergence is not a detriment, it's an asset", and then Rhys says: "Shake my head Ryan" __[Erin and Amy laugh]__ 'cause he started bitching about Ryan.

[flamango42:] "that's a good point!! I certainly feel I'm funnier (at least in Quiplash) 'cause I'll just look at it from a different direction."

[Speccyferret:] "Matty you're SO GOOD with words." Yes, he is. That's very true.

Yeah. Oh, Quiplash, man. I love it. I just-- __[laughs]__ I think we should all get together and have a social of Quiplash at some point. Have you ever played Quiplash before, Ali?

#### ALI

No idea what it is.

#### ERIN

Oh, it's a-- Have you ever heard of Jackbox?

#### ALI

No. No.

#### ERIN

So it's a game that you can play on a console, but people use their mobile phones to play, and there's all these different games you can play but my favourite by far is the one called Quiplash. It's kind of like mad libs, I suppose in a way, where we kind of come up with funny little answers and, yeah, word play. It's really fun. It's a real good one.

#### AMY

Rhys has put a good point. He said: "It's like really helpful 'cause I'm really detail oriented! The amount of times people have lost things and I've been like 'No, I remember you putting it down here.'"

##### [laughter]

#### ERIN

I'm the same with my partner, as well, actually.

#### AMY

I do that with Tim as well.

#### ERIN

He's always like, yeah, he's like 'Have you seen this?' and I'm like 'Yeah, it's in the third box from the right' and he's like 'How'd you know that?' and I was like 'I think I just have like a sort of a--' to sort of be a bit more gender stereotypical here, I think I have a bit more like a housewifely power to be like, I know exactly where everything is in the house at any given time, apart from the car keys or the house keys. Those are the only things that I ever lose ever. Apart from that, I'm usually pretty good.

I did lose my engagement ring once. My engagement ring. Yeah, I took my engagement ring off to go wash my hands, went downstairs -- when we lived in our old place, we had stairs -- went downstairs, washed my hands, came back upstairs and it disappeared, and it was literally just on the bed next to where I'd left it, but I had a *full* meltdown. And then we just saw it on the bed, and I was like, cool. __[laughs]__

#### AMY

I just realised, Erin, did we announce at the start when we were gonna take a break just so that people know we're gonna have one?

#### ERIN

We didn't, actually. Yeah, thank you so much for reminding me.

#### AMY

That's alright.

#### ERIN

We are gonna take a break and we are gonna take a break, like right now. I mean, it's planned into for the-- Yeah, it's planned in for now, unless there's anything that anyone wants to add super quick or anything that Ali wants to add. We're gonna take a 10 minute break just because, yeah, I think it was-- I know it feels a bit soon, but it was kind of a nicer place to put it 'cause we've got a big chunk of stuff coming up in a bit.

So make sure you stretch your legs. Do a big stretch. Stretch up to the sky and then flop over and get the blood into your brain. Yeah. It's good 'un. Get your water or your fluids of any kind. I've got a little snack with me just here.

When we go back to our hold screen, just before we go back to the hold screen, you will see an advert, just for a second. If you could let it run through, it's just another way to support the channel and support us as well as creators. That would be lovely and then we'll have a break. We'll come back in about 10 minutes time.

Let's just check in on the chat.

notenoughplantpots says: "I did a similar thing with my grandma's house. When I saw her once a year I'd walk around and tell her what she changed since I last saw her." My goodness. That's really cool.

My parents used to be like 'How d'you do these things?' and I'd be like, 'I don't know.' I got to 25 and I was like, 'Oh, this all makes sense now.'

Anyway, let's have a break, 10 minutes. Come back at just after 10 past, and we'll see you then. Thanks so much for joining us so far, and we'll see you at 10 past 9 UK time. Lots of love. Bye.

#### ERIN

Hello, we're back. How is everyone? Did you have a good break? What did you get up to? Did you eat any good snacks? Snacks are important to me. I need to find out about your snacks.

Toni-Dee is eating a crisp sandwich. And I've told them that they need to be my best friend as a result. As of the way that they create a cheese-- sorry, a crisp sandwich, buttered both sides of that bread and a nice standard cheese and onion crisp. __[pats chest]__ Oh, just so happy. I'm a fan of a cheese and onion sandwich with salt and vinegar crisps in it. Yeah.

#### AMY

Erin, you know what happens when we talk about food on these streams.

#### ERIN

Oh no! No no no! __[laughs]__

#### AMY

We'll never get back on topic. Chat is gonna talk about food now for an hour.

#### ERIN

Oh, goddamn it. Oh, it's already here. *(reading chat)* Digestives. Crisp sandwich. Should I go for sugared pindas or a custard cake? I'm having dinner right now. Chips and curry sauce. Oh my god, chats going mad. I had popcorn. I had chocolate. Crisp sandwiches. Ah, green grapes.

Oh dear, what have we done? What have we done?

#### AMY

You knew this would happen. __[laughs]__

#### ERIN

I know. I did, and I continued to do it. I'm sorry. Or am I? Or am I.

So, let's just crack on. Let's just get on with it and then we can vibe later on.

So, these answers are gonna be used a bit more to steer the creation of the guide for the venues, but feel free to continue answering as you have, just wanted to be super-transparent.

So, maybe it's something I open to the Zoom floor first and then we kind of hear from chat what they think so they have some time to think about it. What do you think that theatres and cultural organisations can do within their recruitment processes? So things like offering the questions ahead of the interviews or no longer wanting CVs with job applications. I mean, these are literally things that you've given me and they're just in my plan, so let's talk about that. Let's go for it.

#### LUCY

I could rant about this for ages.

#### ERIN

__[chuckles]__ Go.

#### LUCY

Definitely seen questions I think that benefits everyone. I think if you just gave seeing questions to all candidates, life would be a lot better.

And also, not setting people up to fail. I think there's a lot of problems around certain recruitment processes where it's almost like they're tryna catch you out, and I think that is not how people should do things. I think, really, when you have a candidate in a room, you should be trying to get-- you want to be spoiled for choice really. You want to try and get the best out of people and also try and get the best person for that job. I think people feeling a bit more open to being able to dig, if they feel like somebody hasn't said what they need to say, and also making sure that questions aren't really, really open because, while I don't know about you guys, but I find that -- and I shouldn't have said guys, I apologise -- I don't know about everybody else, but I struggle if they're too open because what I do is I just go to Saturn. __[chuckles]__ Basically, I set off very fast, and there's a point where I've left earth and I could potentially turn this spaceship around, but often I'm off into another orbit. __[laughs]__ And I'm gone. And I've gone on to a complete tangent and I can't get back. And if the questions weren't so open, if I know what I was answering. Oh compound questions! They're a pain in the backside as well, because you forget what you've done before you-- Like, say they've asked like two really meaty things. Can you not just make those two questions? Then you're not expecting people to remember. I mean, at least if it's seen, then you can actually do this. And also, when it's seen, just giving it like a week in advance. Oh, this has actually happened to me. This is why I can rant for ages. Don't just say, 'Oh, you've got 20 minutes in a room with these questions.' I'm like, Are you crazy? I need to go through it. I need to check I've interpreted the thing right.' Yeah, I've got a lot to say on this topic. I'm gonna pause and then somebody else jump in.

#### ERIN

I mean, great. Amy had her hand up.

#### AMY

I was just gonna go to chat 'cause there's some good things in there. Rhys said: "if we're talking face to face interviews, I think there needs to be less stigma about lack of eye contact (plus ways to communicate with nonverbal people)." And that's been seconded by Alex as well.

Flamango said: "I had a rant about the question 'what can you offer us?' just this Sunday." I've got really annoyed recently when I've been applying to jobs that are specifying they want people from the disabled community but still want that traditional work experience, traditional way of getting your qualifications and skills, and there's bound to be someone within the community that has that. How am I meant to explain to you that I have experience and skills, but I've got them in a completely different way? That makes the process so much longer for me.

#### ERIN

Lucy's got her hand straight back up, and I was able to tell because Zoom swapped us around which is amazing. It gave me a real-- 'cause usually I'm crap at noticing people have got their hands, so fire away Lucy.

#### LUCY

I have to say, because I'm a dyspraxic, I have to say it when it's on my brain. Application forms. Why the hell are people still using application forms? __[chuckles]__ What is that about? It doesn't make any sense. I remember having an absolute meltdown, and it was a cultural organisation as well, had a complete meltdown because they will ask you-- I'm self-employed as well as being neurodiverse and then graduating into a recession when work was pretty scarce. And yes, there was patches on my CV, but I don't always volunteer but they were asking me like really detailed things, and I've usually been able to hide the lack of work through other bits by volunteering and whatever, but they were so specific, I had a complete meltdown, and I was just cry. And then I decided I wasn't gonna apply for that job because I was like, 'Well, if the application forms made me cry, why would I want to work there?'

#### ERIN

Aw.

#### LUCY

So, yeah. Just stuff like that.

#### AMY

Lots of people echoing your views on open questions, vague questions, double negatives. Someone had said-- Oh, it was Matty said: "I can kind of unnerve people 'cause I don't always express emotions in the way neurotypicals expect and I sometimes hold myself in a way you wouldn't expect, and I feel like just my posture and facial expressions makes interviewers not want to hire me." I don't think people think down to this level of detail about what goes through our heads when we're going into an interview.

People saying that actually they prefer application forms rather than an open-ended CV or "write a cover letter" but I had one the other day, "write a cover letter" but they gave me no idea of what they wanted in that cover letter at all.

LovedTheKnightSky: "I wish, in general, people would be clearer about what they expect. Not knowing what people want from me makes me really anxious that I'll answer 'the wrong thing', even on open-ended questions."

And notenoughplantpots said: "I hate having to write CVs and cover letters and stuff because dysgraphia is just not letting it happen easily."

#### ERIN

Ali, do you wanna fire away?

#### ALI

Yeah, sure, quickly. So, for me, I have a real response to people's faces and if they look like someone I know, it throws me a bit. That happened to me just before Christmas. I applied for a job, I met the person on Zoom, and I was like, 'Whoa, you look like somebody who is from my past', and unfortunately, they're somebody who isn't a good person in my life. So I would really benefit from knowing who is gonna be at the interview and getting a chance to see what they look like or even just a description, so that I can imagine them in my head before I get there and get comfortable with the idea of being there.

#### ERIN

That's so great. One of my lectures at university told me this horror story about how to be careful about how you speak about other people in the industry, which is slightly off topic, but it just always makes me laugh when I think about it. She had a student who was auditioning for, let's say school A, and she was also auditioning that year for school B, C and D, and then she met this person on the tube, and she was reading sheet music and this person on the tube next to her says, 'Oh, what are you doing?' she's like, 'Oh, I'm auditioning for school A today', and she's like. 'Oh yeah' and she's like, 'Are you nervous? How do you feel about it?' And she was like, 'Ah, not really. I'm not really a huge fan of school A. You know, it's really expensive and a bit pretentious but I'm just going for the sake of it, just to get the practice in', and then she turns up at school A, and that woman from the tube is the pianist for her audition, which just-- __[laughs]__ which I mean is just one of those things. It's not *really* related to neurodivergence but I just-- every time I think about it, it's just, aww, the embarrassment. Just always gives me a good laugh. And I think that person would have been very happy to have had a sheet before going and knowing exactly what her audition panel would have looked like.

Lucy, you got your hand up.

#### LUCY

Sorry, I'm just not doing very well at using computers.

#### ERIN

Sorry.

#### LUCY

I've got the opposite problem to Ali which is that I have face-blindness, so sometimes I walk into a room and my brains a bit silly because it decides that it's going to-- the way that it recognises people is by their hair, but hair is an easily changed thing. And so, I'm stuffed and then sometimes I just don't recognise people and it's just excruciating.

But some people have got really noticeable faces, so I know who they are. There's a Mighty Boosh episode where they draw one of the characters as a cream blob. And that's sometimes how I feel when I look *(laughing)* at certain people's faces.

Oh yeah, back to the CV and covering letter format, which was originally why I raised my hand, was that I think if they're gonna make it-- regardless of what they do, they need to make it as simple as possible. So, what I don't like about application forms is that they take a very long time because you have to input into their particular framework what I've done in my life, and it's often not set up for being a freelancer either so you're inputting, like, millions of things from years, years, 16 to wherever you are on the age ladder. That really irritates me.

I know what you mean. I used to be scared of CVs and covering letters, but actually I've got a CV that I know what I'm doing with and I just slightly alter the format of it but everything's on there. And then the covering letter, if they're not telling you what to write on the covering letter or it's weird, then that's them just not knowing how to recruit, I think.

And some people have started changing their process, but it's worse than it was because at least when you've got bullet points of the person spec, you know that you can just go that bullet point, that bullet point, that bullet point, right, I've done this by doing this, I've done this by doing this. If they say, 'Oh yeah, tell us--' It's like this dead, vague paragraph about what you've got to include. __[blows raspberries]__ Yeah.

#### ERIN

There's a point in chat-- I mean, everything that you said Lucy was super interesting there, but I just wanted to bounce off something that chat has said very quickly and it's a question for Ali. SapphicNerd says: "Oh right, maybe you know this, do they only want people with a diagnosis to fill in the survey or also people with only assumed neurodivergency?" Ali.

#### ALI

I would love anybody who identifies as neurodivergent to fill out that survey. It absolutely doesn't matter whether a doctor has said to you yes or no. If you feel like your experience is impacted by the way that your brain is built, and that you feel like title applies to you, please fill it out. It'll be so, so helpful for all of us making this guide. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

#### AMY

I wanna go back to the chat for a second if that's okay 'cause there's some really good messages.

#### ERIN

Yeah, absolutely.

#### AMY

And I'm so worried that I'm gonna lose them.

#### ERIN

Yeah, go for it.

#### AMY

And I also wanted to comment on something that was said earlier around putting all of your details into the application form. I find I'm always really worried that places I apply to jobs with are gonna judge me because I've got quite a full work history, I've moved around a lot, and I believe that I've moved around a lot because places are inaccessible and I have a lot of chronic illness and needs, not because I'm a bad worker but it's never ever read that way.

But I'll go back to what is in the chat, because we had quite a lot of good points. So, I'm gonna read up from the bottom this time so I didn't scroll down wrong.

concerned_hobbit: "I've had a thing where I've moved around so often, and sometimes I see someone who looks familiar, and I have to take a second to think of the person they remind me of is somebody who lives in my current city, and might be someone I know, or if they remind me of someone I knew several years ago, who lived halfway across the country."

And then Flamengo has said: "I think if you don't know what a neurodiverse person wants or needs, ask AND give some suggestions 'cause it can be hard to come up with it. Also, accept that we may not know or know right now."

LovedTheKnightSky has said: "I had a teacher that before my music college auditions walked me through the entire process of auditions and talked about who would be in the panel and it was super helpful."

So it's good to hear good practice that you've experienced before and where you'd like to see something the way that someone's treated you before when it's been good as well.

#### ERIN

Mm. Mm. I'm just gonna kind of maybe walk us down the figurative road, if you like, of that process and maybe talk a little bit more about post-hiring process. So we talked a little bit about interviews and recruitment. What can these organisations and these venues do to support things like commissioning? I've got some examples here. For example, allowing flexible contracts, agreeing aims and goals of commissions with artists before signing contracts, or providing a quiet space for all artists inside a venue. And that's also gonna be the last point that I'll raise, and then I'll let Ali very much lead the discussion towards the end to make sure she's getting all the answers that she wants.

Yeah, let's have a chat about commissioning and working post hire if you like, post recruitment.

#### TONI

I mean, the--

#### AMY

I think--

#### TONI

Ooh.

#### AMY

No, you go. You're the guest.

#### TONI

Oh, stop it! I think there's something about having room to respond that's really important when you employ someone or commission someone or are giving someone money for their services and being really aware of the fact that things change. It's not as simple as 'if I write everything down on this sheet of paper, now it's all going--' you know, I'm gonna be able to meet every need because you've written it down for me. Actually, lots of people need stuff to change on the spot. Things are not as easy or as binary as we've managed to address all your access needs, so things will never need to change. And I think part of the issue with cultural organisations is that they think they take a disability workshop, and they learn three points about how to support neurodiverse people and then they go, 'Yeah, we've done it. We know how to support people.' And actually having room to respond is supporting neurodiverse people and having room to respond is actually a disability justice framework, being able to better understand that doing things, yes, having a structure is ga-- is great. I nearly said having a structure is gay then, which like, the queer is just like of course. Of course. __[Erin laughs loudly]__ I think it's 'cause I--

#### ERIN

So, I deliberately unmuted just so I could show how much I was laughing. I was like, that's wonderful.

#### TONI

It's 'cause this is in front of me. __[holds up rainbow flag]__ That was like a slip that happened because of a visual cue.

##### [Erin continues laughing]

But structures are great. Part of the problem is that people think structure is the *only* way you can support people and that's just not true.

And sorry Amy, I interrupted you before you spoke.

#### AMY

The good thing about me is if you interrupt me, I instantly forget whatever it was I was planning to say anyway, so I'm not annoyed because, as far as I'm concerned, I have nothing to say. __[laughs]__

Matty said about predictability: "I know with autistic specifically, autistic people get comfortable from knowing what's gonna happen and I think it's an important thing to stress."

Rhys also said about at big events, making sure that you have quiet spaces, which are both really good points.

#### ERIN

mysticflamea said: "The Veterinarian that I work with always encourages us to ask questions so that we can actually know how the medical process goes down, always ask questions." I think there was a lot of, when I was training as an actor and then doing work as a producer and a production assistant, it was always like, that was a stupid question. And I'm like, I need to know the answer, so was it a stupid question? I actually got officially reprimanded for asking questions at a job once because I didn't understand. __[chuckles]__ And they were like, 'Stop asking questions. You're not here to ask questions', and I was like, 'but this is about a procedure and I don't understand it', so I didn't spend much time there after that.

#### ALI

Point, Erin. Sorry.

#### ERIN

Yeah, go.

#### ALI

On that point, I think something that is really needed is actually less assuming, and more question asking in general.

#### ERIN

Yeah.

#### ALI

And that fits in with recruitment and with commissioning, but especially with commissioning I think, you know, that includes either reaching out to an artist or they reply for a particular opportunity, but that by no means, therefore, means that this artist is prepared, ready, has the ability to engage with your venue or your system in the way that you expect them to. And I think so many of our problems come from people assuming that we just all have the same knowledge, that we all just know, or that we all feel good about doing X, Y, Z and ask a question.

#### ERIN

Yeah. There's something I just wanted to highlight. Lucy, I can see your hand up. I'll come to you in just a second. And maybe this will fit better under the next time we're talking about communication next, but some of the chat are using what we call tone indicators in the chat and tone and cadence. I don't know, Every Brain folks if you're familiar with them, but they are, you might see in the chat some people are saying like, /s some people said /lh. So, /lh means lighthearted, /s means sarcastic. We've got a whole list. I will happily share them with you after the stream. But communicating via text I think is tricky for everyone but particularly when you're neurodivergent reading text and tone is super difficult, which is why in both mine and Amy's communities we use tone indicators.

And there's /lyric so we know that someone's just singing a lyric and not being super depressed all of a sudden because they're singing like a Nickelback lyric or something. Tone indicators really help so much, and I think this will def-- I realise now as I'm saying this out loud, this will definitely come under communication for sure, and I'm more than happy to send you that information when we get there. But yeah, they are really, really, really useful, and I think it goes under the thing of not assuming as well.

I think I saw a really great piece on the internet recently about people who are askers and people who are guessers. Did anyone else see that? It was like, are you an asker or a guesser? And there are some people who are guessers so they kind of assume things or they expect to be asked, or they expect people to ask them rather than tell people what they want. And then there are people who are the askers who the guessers feel very violated by, 'cause they're like, 'ah, why are you asking all these questions?' It's super interesting, I'll see if I can find the resource and put it in the chat.

#### AMY

Tim and I as a couple, definitely-- You have different sets of base language. We view common sense in different ways, which leads to a relationship where we're constantly over explaining ourselves, but we do it on purpose, because we know the other person may misinterpret it, so when you listen to our conversations from the outset, they sound really strange. 'Cause they're like, 'I'm saying this because I know that sometimes you interpret this, and my tone is meaning this.'

Back on the actions people can take, one thing that I wanted to stress that I'd noticed since I started doing our work, Erin, as inclusivity trainers, and it's very much pitching to people, trying to get across to people that actually it takes a lot of work and energy, probably more so for me, to put something together for a pitch, then maybe it might someone else. And similarly, the amount of work it takes for people to constantly have to ask for adjustments and access needs, especially if they're changing over time. That's a lot of work, and also there's a certain defensiveness of 'I've come to you three times and asked for something and I know you're being really good about it at the minute, but when's the point gonna come when you're gonna get fed up with me and decide that it's really annoying that I'm doing this' and--

#### ERIN

I'm-- Sorry. Carry on.

#### AMY

I was just saying and the experience of that beforehand, like that people need to realise this isn't the first time we've done this. We've been in an employment before or working with someone before where eventually they've got fed up of us asking for something.

#### ERIN

I've just realised that Lucy said-- Sorry Amy, I just cut you off. I realised that Lucy had her hand up, ages ago before I went off about tone indicators and I said I'd come back to her and I didn't and now she's looking like she's about to burst wanting to tell us something, so Lucy, the floor is yours and I'm so sorry for forgetting to come back to you.

#### LUCY

No. I want to respond to what Amy said.

#### ERIN

Go go go.

#### LUCY

In fact, it's exactly what I was gonna say before is that when I was working for a venue, I get stuck in processes so if I forget-- you know in a computer, I forget what the window was that I had to get into to get to the window that I need, but I know that that exists. And so I just basically had to call [incomprehensible]. I must have asked him about 17 times how to do this certain thing, and I think people just need to understand that I do want to do it and I'm quite happy to do it, but I might have to ask you like more than 17 times __[chuckles]__ how to get there because it took me seven years to learn a computer software for music which I use quite regularly at work. I think the fact that it took me seven years to learn it is meant that I'm better at teaching it to young people. But yeah, I just need somebody to be really patient with me and not give a shit that I've asked like 17 times. So, yeah. Which is pretty much what you're saying, isn't it? Yeah, yeah.

##### [silence]

#### ERIN

I thought you were coming in, Toni. I was giving you the space. Ali, you look like you want to say something. Sorry.

#### ALI

No, I was gonna just say that I feel like a lot of this can also be summarised under the banner of just understanding this from a holistic point of view. Just kind of thinking about, you know, everybody is different and that really is, that's just the truth of it and coming at these projects with an intention to be open and to be flexible, rather than the expectation that people will meet your standards and your systems. I think that certainly is like, as the lead producer now of Every Brain, this has been the first project that I've run where I feel like I've had an understanding of like, this is how I can produce with kindness, and I think that that makes a big difference. When I think about that, like before I write an email or I respond to something, whether or not something is going well or going slightly off task, the idea of intentionally thinking about how can I think broadly about this, be kind towards this person as somebody who's leading, I think that does enable me to-- but that's the start of being open to whatever way that person could preferably be supported. And I wish that other arts producers would take that on board, to be honest.

#### ERIN

And when you say supported, do you mean in terms of how people are spoken to or...? Sorry I'm just...

#### ALI

Yep.

#### ERIN

Maybe it's me.

#### ALI

I mean how people are spoken to, I mean how people are communicated with, I mean how people receive information or also how they receive tasks to to be done on their half. It just takes me a small bit of brainpower to think about, like, 'Oh, I asked this person two weeks ago, "How would you prefer me to ask you to do something?" and to do it that way', intentionally thinking about them before myself makes a big difference.

#### ERIN

Mm. Mm. Absolutely. I don't have anything to add to that. I'm just really enjoying-- I'm getting to a point now where I feel like we're hitting our stride. I'm just really enjoying absorbing all of this information as well, and chat is saying some really lovely things, mostly about people who are writing using ellipses in their texts. __[laughs]__ I hate the word "texts". That sound always makes me go eugh. Or "crisps", that's another one as well.

Matty says: "I'm stimming. I love this chat."

rowan_twigs says: "Exactly the same hat, I just got an email saying 'Thank you Rowan.... that's fine...'" __[laughs]__ That's quite creepy. Maybe it's a generational thing, perhaps, if it was both the driving instructor and the professor around the same age. I don't know.

Ali, do you wanna talk a bit more about communication? You've got some lovely things here about durations of meetings -- I think everyone could benefit from limiting durations of meetings -- and communication methods as well. That's something that Amy and I are very keen on is making sure that all of the stuff we create is accessible in every format, so why don't we talk about that a little bit?

#### ALI

Yeah, yeah, for sure. Yeah, certainly really interested in what ways could venues and organisations flexibly communicate with people who are neurodivergent. A lot of my learning, actually, on this has come from when I was working on a project that was led by the great and magical Tony-Dee Paul, who is in this Zoom. When Toni-Dee was making a project called *Doze* last year that I had the pleasure of producing, and there was just an inherent built-in system of Toni asking us, myself and the team, how we would preferably receive information, receive instruction, how we could respond to that. And that built in this way of like, 'I know Toni's gonna ask me "how can they support me?" and I know that I can be honest in that response and that is gonna be respected.' That was the first time I really have received that care from somebody who was hiring me, and I have channeled it into Every Brain.

So, just to give an example of what we did on this project is that when everybody was hired, I designed this thing called an access rider, which is like if you imagine you're a pop star and you're playing at some crazy big venue, and you have rider, which is you tell them what you want when you arrive like, you know, only red Starburst and loads of Dr Pepper. Well, there are some amazing templates of access riders online and I found one and kind of use some of those bits and then put a few things of my own in, but really this was a document sent to all members of the team and it just asked them questions like what times of the day might you work, how long would you prefer to be in meetings, and what is the maximum of that?

#### ERIN

Wonderful.

#### ALI

Yeah, and I think what was important was that I needed to know, in myself as the producer, that I'm gonna match what these answers are. I can't send out that document and then be like, 'Okay, well that's nice, but it doesn't work for me.' And so what was really interesting was, for example, the question that I asked about 'what is the longest time that you could comfortably be in a meeting?' The lowest marks in those answers was 30 minutes, and so I then said to myself, 'Okay, this project will run meetings of 30 minutes and they won't go over', and that's just to ensure that everybody is at a level of being comfortable. So, I'm really interested in what do we need or what could we have better? That just makes communicating easier, and that can be like, stop putting "..." in your emails, and it might also be like, 'don't call me on Wednesdays, please', and then adhering to that, basically.

#### ERIN

Toni, fire away.

#### ALI

Yeah Toni, please.

#### TONI

Yeah, I just wanted to say that committing to the thing that you want to communicate is really important, as Ali indicated there, because it's one thing to say, as an organisation or someone leading a project, that you're attempting to work with marginalised communities or you'd like a disabled person to come and work in this role, and then to not actually be able to accommodate the things that those people need is (1) just a really fucked up thing to do, and (2) it encourages a culture of doing things on a surface value and not actually delivering the care that people need to be looked after in their roles.

I was in a job recruitment process recently where a chronically ill artist was advertising for a certain role, and there was a tension with two people that were in the running for the role because one of those people were really strong administratively and was neurotypical, actually. But I'm not saying that you can't be strong administratively if you're neurodiverse. That's absolutely not true. But I think that that was something that they prided themselves on was their ability to get on with stuff administratively. There was another candidate who I thought was absolutely brilliant and would deliver the job with care and nurture the role in a way that I thought was really exciting. And they had said straight away that they were disabled, and they explained, I thought quite beautifully, how their disability shapes the way that they do their job. And there was this tension, right, about like, are we avoiding addressing the fact that this person is disabled and will do the job differently to someone who is neurotypical and is actually priding themselves on being able to do the things heavily administratively? And what we actually had to do was talk really practically about what the job needed, and we didn't end up going with that person that was disabled, but I thought it was really important to have a wind-down conversation with them about what in the role is gonna be required for this person who we have given the job to and so that they don't feel like them disclosing their disabilities and being really honest about their superpowers is somehow a hindrance to them not getting the job, because that would be the last thing I would want, and also, you can see the path of people finally being confident to talk about their disabilities and then having an experience like that, that feels like it shuts you down and actually all that progresses is lost, I imagine it's not an easy thing to come to. I've never done it, to come to a job interview and be really honest about how your disability works with the way that you work. Yeah, I thought that it was an interesting thing as a disabled person talking about employing another disabled person, but also how you can talk about the ways in which you need certain things that someone can't provide and also caring enough to make sure that that person doesn't feel like that them disclosing their disability has worked against them somehow.

#### AMY

I think those debriefs are *so* important. There're so many times when I've got a rejection from a role and I'm like, I know I'm not meeting your criteria exactly the way that you want me to because I'm disabled and I've explained that, but I've just got a rejection, so I never know whether that was the issue or not.

I once had the director of fundraising at SANE, the mental health charity, spend 40 minutes on the phone with me after I didn't get a job talking me through it, which was extremely nice of him.

I just wanted to make a point on one of my issues is I hate being promised things or told things are gonna happen and then they don't. I understand that things change, but if I'm told a process is one thing and then I contact again, and often it's someone else who gets back to me because an organisation has lots of people, and I find myself back at the start of a process because the first person has told me the process wrong, or the process has change. That's just really disheartening for me, so I think making sure you know what your process is, and everybody knows it and is consistent, and also that you've got a system in place that means that multiple people aren't responding to the same thing in different ways.

#### ERIN

Hmm. Lucy. Do you wanna fire away? Yeah?

#### LUCY

I got something that just is a little tip for people who, when they get feedback, they think, 'Hmm.' If you think they fudged it and you think it's just not doing what it's meant to do, you can put in a GDPR request for the interview scripts, and they have actually got a legal responsibility to provide you with them. You may have to pay the postage for them, but they have a legal responsibility to send them. And if they have shredded them, which has happened to me, then they can get in quite a lot of trouble. But it's just a little tip, because then you can actually see what they've written about you, and it does help sometimes if they've got really wishy-washy feedback, I think-- I just wanted to share this with the rest of the community.

#### ERIN

No, it's amazing. I've never considered that before.

#### LUCY

Because, well, I've done it a few times when I've been __[laughs]__ really pissed off.

#### ERIN

Don't blame you girl. Like, absolutely.

#### LUCY

Also, if people aren't giving-- some organisations are really stupid and don't give you feedback, and that's annoying.

#### ERIN

Mm.

#### LUCY

So if they've not giving you feedback, bloody do it.

#### ERIN

Yeah.

#### LUCY

There's no harm in it, is there? And also, people in interviews need to understand that when they're writing stuff, people-- if they're writing stuff about me, I could easily get that, and I think, if you're on an interview panel, you need to think about that as well.

#### ERIN

Just to let you know everyone that we had -- I think Ali is actioning that as we speak -- we had hydrate redeemed in chat from wildhorse6. I think that's what Ali's doing.

Yeah, I never knew that was a thing. I did not know that that existed.

#### LUCY

My partner is like a bit of an oracle in unemployability stuff, so it's helped.

#### ERIN

Ooh! A good person to know.

#### LUCY

Yeah, it's helped a lot. So basically, I might have answers to things if you need them. __[chuckles]__

#### ERIN

Oooh, everyone hit up Lucy for employability stuff.

I'm just getting a bit conscious of the time. Oh, Alex has redeemed stretch. Okay everyone, we need to stretch.

I'm just going a bit conscious of the time and wanted to just pop on to access chat, and then just to make sure that we can respect everyone's time and people can get off at 10 if they want to, basically.

Ali went to get beer, amazing. I mean, so valid. Everyone is valid here. Good for you.

Yeah, is there anything that you want to talk about in terms of access, Ali?

#### ALI

I think you could call this whole conversation is about access. Absolutely. I think, I suppose more specifically, I'm also thinking about what can venues do that specifically support somebody that might be physically or emotionally entering a building or a work process. One thing that I've heard about recently is venues building social stories or maps that are of the physical place, or they might be like a map of the organisation as it works from home. So I'm really interested in what those things could be.

And Erin's hand is up.

#### ERIN

I had a, well, a few things, just a few really good experiences I wanted to share, and I'm really looking forward to sharing some of these. But the first one is pre-COVID or before COVID (BC), I did a comedy night in South London where it was run by a company called... *(unsure)* Mainspring? I think. I'm really sorry if you're watching this, __[laughs]__ and I've just completely forgotten your name, but they had social stories there so what's gonna happen and where the sounds are gonna come from and where the light's gonna come from and that kind of stuff. And they also had a rack of ear defenders at the front, which was just amazing, as well. I loved it.

#### LUCY

That's amazing.

#### ERIN

Oh, I loved it! I love my ear defenders more than life so they come with me everywhere, but even my partner who's neurotypical, was like, 'I might crack a pair on, just see kind of what it's like', and he was like, 'Oh, that's very peaceful.' And he was like, 'I put them back for someone who actually needs them', but he was like, 'Oh, that's suddenly very peaceful.'

I wanted to share, I went to the Apple Store a couple of days ago, which is not something I like doing 'cause it's in the centre of Brighton and I don't live in the centre of Brighton, and it meant going into town on a lunch time and it was just eugh, and going into a mall as well, which is hell, and I told the chap that I was being seen by -- he was very good looking, I feel it's important to mention that he was very, very good looking -- I wasn't wearing a mask 'cause of being neurodivergent I'm exempt from wearing a mask, and he said, 'oh, if you have to--' but I won't bore you with what the story was about my laptop, but he's like, 'If you do have to come in for your Genius Bar appointment next week, we can schedule it so it's out of hours', and I was like 'What?' and he's like, 'Yeah, so if you need a space that's calmer--' because basically we were talking about how would I wear a mask and they have to have something to protect us if we're doing an appointment. And I was like, 'Yeah, that's not gonna work', and he was like, 'Well, what we can do is that we can have it so that we're wearing a mask, but we'll put you in a space that is quiet so that you're able to understand' 'cause, also being neurodivergent, I lip read. So the thing that came out of this whole sort of puzzle of "how do we deal with this in an accessible way?" is that they were gonna open the store, essentially, just for me to have this appointment, so that I can understand them when I was talking to them. And I know Apple is a massive organisation with billions and billions and billions of pounds, it's not difficult for them to do that, but it was really nice actually. And for an employee, as well, to be well-versed in that, for me to be like, 'oh, I'm neurodivergent', and he's like, 'I know exactly what that means and exactly what you need' was just so nice. It's, like, one of the first times I've genuinely been like, 'oh, okay.' I mean, I've had lovely experiences in some organisations who work explicitly with neurodivergent artists and they know exactly what to do. That was the first time I'd been with a big corporation, if you like, who instantly knew what neurodivergent meant, and what I needed as a result of that. It was lovely.

#### LUCY

Not all corporates can do that, you know. I think that's pretty impressive actually.

#### ERIN

Yeah.

#### LUCY

That's points to Apple.

#### ERIN

Thanks Apple. __[snickers]__

#### LUCY

Nice one, Apple.

#### ERIN

Thanks Sam at Apple. __[laughs]__ In Brighton.

#### LUCY

I think the thing about stories is right, and I think also maybe offering a bit of a breakdown of what the process is gonna be when you visit. And I also want to be a bit gushing about Ali and her agendas, because I love an agenda and I like it ahead, because I used to be in meetings and I'd be put on the spot, and I'd find that really difficult, and they'd asked for information. Like, my boss would pop up like Mr Benn -- if you're old like me and you know who Mr Benn is -- and just ask me for statistics, and I'm like, I can't remember what I did like 5 minutes ago. My short-term memory is rubbish. I don't know how you expect me to remember all of this off the tip of my tongue. So, I just love a good agenda, and that's been really helpful so that I don't feel like I'm under pressure, and also, it's something that I started using now when I'm doing meetings with my mate, who I'm starting up a company with, because otherwise we just go on tangents. And it made our meeting 30 minutes long. So, there you go.

#### ERIN

I'm sorry, I just want some [incomprehensible] face. Ali, fire away. Go for it.

#### ALI

No, I just find the silence quite funny, 'cause there's of course so much to say but we're all, you know-- it's also late and we're tired and also we're all being polite and kind.

#### ERIN

Yeah.

#### ALI

Sorry, I get nervous and silent.

#### ERIN

We need a few more of these and then we can start being a bit more rude and a bit more informal, not rude, but a bit more informal with each other. And it's an excuse for us all to collaborate again. I mean, why not? You know. We're not going anywhere.

#### AMY

As Matty has said in the chat, it's processing time as well.

#### ERIN

Yes.

#### AMY

And the later we get and the tired-er we get, the longer we need to *(laughing)* process information.

#### ERIN

Speaking of that, I am conscious that it is five to 10. We're nearly at the end of our allotted discussion time, if you like. If you're in the chat and you're super tired, please don't feel any-- We've kind of covered the bulk of what we need really at this point. The remaining points we have is AOB [any other business] so if you need to disappear off, even I'm starting to get a bit like, "whoa" now. Kind of like getting to the end of a big project for me and now my brains like, 'Haha, we finished it. Goodbye.' __[shutting down noise]__ So yeah.

Amy's gone. She's noped out. __[laughs]__

So yeah, if you wanna head off, absolutely no hard feelings whatsoever. Ali is also very kindly said that we can get in touch. If you want a bit of time to process or just need a bit of time to digest or if you're lying in bed and a week later and you're like, 'Oh yeah, shit, that's what I wanted to say and I completely forgot', then Ali will put some links in chat, and you can get in touch with Every Brain and let them know. It's not like a closed off thing, like after the stream ends, you can't ever tell us anything again. Please feel free to reach out at any time for any reason, because we like being friends.

"Just making sure that Tim's running my bath." I mean, if Tim is not for running baths, what is he for? Let's be honest.

We've got some lovely stuff coming in on chat-- Oh, it's just our links, yeah, so you can find out more about us. Please do email us. Yay. God bless that man. Yes. He's a good boy, isn't he?

SatyrnsMoon: "I have therapy in 5 minutes." Very important. Go and do that. "Thank you so much." Thank you for being here. It's a pleasure to have you.

Any other business? Anything else? Anything anyone wants to add? And that's not just Zoom, that's chat as well. And then I think that'll take us nicely to 10 o'clock.

#### ALI

I would really like to invite those of us on the panel, if there's anything that we'd like to say in reflection or just to express how they feel right now. I find that quite helpful to just notice how I feel at the end of something before it comes to an end. If anybody would like to do that...

#### TONI

Yeah, I can do that. So, we have a check-in and check-out system that we do at work that's how you feeling in your mind, your body, and then something that you're grateful for. And obviously, not everyone has to do that 'cause you might find it very pretentious or not helpful, but I find it really helpful to feel like I'm checking out of a process at the end of it.

So, my mind feels incredibly stimulated from all of the conversation. And also, I'm a little bit distracted by the fact that there are new people talking about the things that we're talking about. I secretly had the Twitch open on my phone on the side. And I'm like, 'Oh my god, these are people talking about the work we're doing. This is amazing!' So I feel quite stimulated, and I'll probably have to stand in the shower for 40 minutes to come down off the high.

My body is full of crisps and chocolate, which maybe I shouldn't have done at half nine, but oh well. And I'm really grateful for the opportunity to talk about the work that we're doing with a bunch of people we've never met before, in a time where being able to do that is harder than ever, because in a world pre-pandemic, you can engage with lots of different people, strangers, because you're allowed to do that, and we can't do that in the ways that we would normally have, so I'm really glad that we've had the opportunity to do this with strangers on the internet.

##### [chuckling]

#### ERIN

Apollo has arrived two minutes before the end. Hi Apollo. __[laughs]__ It's one of our followers who everyone adores.

#### AMY

Based on Apollo dropping in at the end, I just wanted to say--

#### ERIN

*(laughing)* Hi Apollo!

#### AMY

I wanted to say what I try and remember to say relatively often with streams and with Discord, which is a big thank you to everyone who's been involved in the chat but also thank you to everyone who's listened in and hasn't wanted to talk. You're just as welcome and valid here. And saying to people who are watching on VOD, thank you so much for tuning in. We know it's not always accessible to come at this time.

#### ERIN

Hello from the past. We are from the past. __[laughs]__

#### AMY

Yes, we are just as eager for you all your views, and we're just as glad that you're here. So, thank you very much for that. I am not gonna check-in with my body or mind, because if I do, it will realise how tired it is. __[tired chuckle]__

#### ERIN

Just push it down.

#### AMY

And I just need to wash and go to bed, so my body and brain are both being ignored for a good half an hour more.

#### ERIN

But what are you grateful for?

#### AMY

What am I grateful for? I'm *always* grateful when I do these streams. I'm always super tired before I come on, and then I'm really uplifted by how honest everyone is in the chat, how supportive you all are of each other, and how excited you get by these kinds of projects, because that's what gives us all the enthusiasm to keep doing them.

#### ERIN

That's so nice. Lucy, what are you mind/body grateful for? I love that, Toni. I'm gonna be using it forever.

#### LUCY

Right, so my brain is gonna be thinking things that I wanna say about all night, so I'm gonna have to listen to podcasts to-- that's my thing, podcasts and the shape game, that's gonna be me. And then, I am quite tired, __[chuckles]__ but that's okay. That's the body thing. And I'm just grateful because I've had a nice time and it's been fun. And I've never done Twitch before, so this is a new experience.

#### ERIN

Welcome when the dark side. __[laughs]__

#### LUCY

And when Ali said, 'Oh, we're doing Twitch', I'm like, 'That's cool.' I don't know about this, and I should probably know about this 'cause I work with young people a lot, and they know about things that I don't know. So, this is new and fun, so thank you for having us on.

#### AMY

It's exhausting, and it can sometimes feel a bit deflating when you come off of it 'cause you've had so much input and then all of a sudden it's gone, so make sure you look after yourselves once this is finished.

#### ERIN

Yeah, you get a bit of an adrenaline drop afterwards like when you come offstage, and you suddenly just feel it really. Like when you finish the show or you have a week's run of a show and then you get the flu, like, the week after, you do feel a bit of that kind of like "oof". So tomorrow, please really, really take care of yourself. Blankets, tea, cats, whatever your thing is.

#### LUCY

Yeah, I don't have that option, I've got to chase after small child.

#### ERIN

Oh yeah! Oh god, of course.

#### LUCY

That's fine. No, she's basically mindfulness in a small person. It's great.

#### ERIN

How old is your baby?

#### LUCY

She's 19 months so she's--

#### ERIN

Is she ready to be enslaved yet? And I'm going to say that with a /j so everyone knows that I'm joking. But is she ready to--

#### LUCY

In what way?

#### ERIN

Is she ready to do things for you, I mean?

#### LUCY

Oh, she's great! __[Erin laughs]__ I get her to unpack the shopping. She loves doing that. But we're going to the park tomorrow. No, she likes doing it 'cause she likes labeling things, so she goes, 'potato'.

##### [Lucy and Erin laugh]

And, you know, it's good and she gives them to you to put away or she puts them in cupboards for people.

#### ERIN

My parents had me on cups of tea by the time I was able to reach the kettle, pretty much.

#### LUCY

Yeah.

#### ERIN

They were like, 'Okay, come on.' What is having a child if not to make it do things for you?

#### LUCY

Well, she knows the coffee cups. Oh, she's associated the word "coffee" with "cough", so when I say coffee, she goes __[coughs]__.

#### AMY

Just to note, there's a lot of *Neighbourly* plugs in the chat for Matty's podcast, if anyone wants some lovely horror podcast to relax to after this. Erin, we're three minutes past 10. Do we wanna do you quickly and then we will all disappear?

#### ERIN

Yeah, and Ali as well hasn't had her turn. So, fire away Ali, and then I'll do mine very quickly.

#### ALI

I'll go now like, dead quick. Thank you.

In my mind, I'm feeling very proud of the team that is making Every Brain happen, and I'm very excited about our new collaborations with yourselves and with everybody on the chat today. Thank you so much. I know it's a big deal to make this work and seeing happen is a little bit emotional sometimes.

My body is, yeah, you know, tired, and I've been it all day so that's fine and normal. And, in general, I'm taking away from this lots of new knowledge and lots of reflections about different experiences, and I can't wait to read through the chat. So thank you everybody. That's what I have to say. Cheers.

#### ERIN

Thank you. Thank you so much. Cheers to that. Absolutely. I cheers-ed you with my water.

My mind is feeling very overstimulated in a good way. Just so much stuff buzzing around. My body is feeling alright, actually, which is unusual for this time of night. And I'm very grateful for all of you. I know that streamers and content creators say this all the time but really there would be-- there's no point in us doing this without the audience here. I know everyone has echoed that they're very grateful for the chat, so thank you for coming and providing your views because, really, that's what we're doing it for.

I'm also very, very grateful for the mods. They've done an amazing job tonight keeping everything safe and structured for everyone in the chat, which has just been a real blessing. So massive shout out to AlexTBlue, rhysgeistman, Speccyferret and mattyoksmith from Team Erin and Team DIO for being the best mods, as always. I don't know why I'm saying-- I mean, I say this every time. They never change, they are consistently wonderful.

#### AMY

Especially, I know some of you have been having tough and long days, so thank you so much for bearing with us so late.

#### ERIN

Thank you.

Alright, I think we should let people bugger off who want to bugger off because it is very much buggering off time. Ali, speaking of our mods, they've been putting all of the links and things for you in the chat, but is there anything else that you want to say or share or make sure people can get in touch with you or plug anything? This is your time.

#### ALI

Yeah, so I would say, if you're on Twitter, please do follow us on Twitter, that's where a lot of that info gets put on. We're gonna be launching our website probably next week, which will have information about what we're doing right now and how you can get involved, but really those surveys that the mods have been kindly posting, that's the most direct thing that you could do right now to help us with this current project. And that's what I have to say. Thank you.

#### ERIN

Thank you. Lucy, Toni-Dee, anything to add? No.

#### LUCY

Many thanks!

#### ERIN

Aww, many thanks to you. Thank you.

#### TONI

You're awesome! Thanks for having us!

#### ERIN

Aww, you are so awesome. Amy, your face is "I'm very tired and I want to go and--"

##### [Amy groans]

##### [Erin laughs]

I know that face very, very well. __[laughs]__ I'm gonna hang out and chill here for another-- well, I mean, just until everything winds down. I'm gonna hang out for another half an hour or so, I think, maximum before I start to get to the point that Amy's at. So, Amy if you wanna head off, you totally can. Alternatively, you wanna stay, you can. It's completely up to you. Bye! Okay, she's gone. Okay. __[laughs]__ She was like, 'Bye. See you later.'
