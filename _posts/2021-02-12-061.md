summary: "Episode 61 - Viciousness and Vice-Admirals <br/><br/>A client who would prefer to maintain their anonymity (known only as Scarlette) is looking for advice on at what point below board transactions spill over into full blown space piracy. Records also indicate that consultants were joined by Vice Admiral Fun for motivational support reasons. <br/><br/>Management Consultants’ advice: imaginary gifts of pity, make sad horse glue, moral quandary anaphylaxis, party games, mind balloons, elephant husbandry, flamboyant piracy in the name of the board, space parties."

_(singsong)_ ♪ Hey hey hey hey hey, hey hey hey-- ♫

#### DAVID

_(annoyed)_ Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, *hey*!

#### TREXEL

♪ --here, here, here, here is a David, sitting so forlorn in the middle of the room. [__DAVID__: Well-- What-- Um--] Hey David, why do you look so gloomy, with your little eyes looking out at me? __[David sighs]__ Saying as if to say, 'Trexel save me.' ♫

#### DAVID

No--

#### TREXEL

♪ Don't worry David. Don't worry David. ♫

#### DAVID

Okay, I'm not.

#### TREXEL

♪ Don't worry David, I'm heeeere. ♫

#### DAVID

No, I'm-- Good, I'm so glad you turned up for your shift.

#### TREXEL

I'm... a cheerful boy, David. Do you know why I'm a cheerful boy?

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Do *not* ask him. It is a trap.

#### DAVID

Why are you a cheerful boy, Trexel?

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Why do you do this?

#### TREXEL

I'm so glad you asked, David. Because I take pride and joy in my work. And I don't know about you, that means something to me. You know, clones these days, the ah-- It's not like the old days, back when *I* was--

#### DAVID

_(interrupting, archly)_ What, where they just got blended after about four hours?

#### TREXEL

Exactly! They had *respect.* You're absolutely right, David. Now-- nowadays, you just flit around, planning... y'know, bits of trees, and here and there--

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ It's hard to turn a blind eye when you keep yelling 'I'm guilty, recycle me please' into my eye.

##### [David makes incoherent strangulated noises to put an end to this line of thought]

#### TREXEL

Complaining, not allow-- Oh, sorry. Sorry, I'll-- I'll do that again. *Not* committing treason __[David sighs]__ at *all*, at *any* point, but still [__DAVID:__ *(softly sarcastic)* Thanks Trexel.] being *real* naughty, and I just think it needs to change, David. And I've got an idea of how to do it. And you are welcome, David. [__DAVID:__ Oh, no.] No, stop thanking me, you're welcome.

#### DAVID

Please, no. Can we just do the brief? Can we just do the brief?

#### TREXEL

I was chasing Fern Creature, because I just needed one or two more ferns, and--

#### DAVID

You haven't got more ferns. Please, don't fill this office with ferns.

#### TREXEL

David, I *have* got more ferns, but they're not for you. They're my ferns. Now, don't worry about that.

#### DAVID

_(interrupting)_ Good! Because it's so hot in here, the ferns that we got yesterday have just died! All of them!

#### TREXEL

That's alright! There's more ferns where they came from, and y'kn-- in a way, I feel like when a fern dies, it takes some sorrow with it out of the world. It's like a... Ferns are like a filter for sadness. At least that's my running theory, because I like ferns--

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ This is *not* how ferns work. They are *just* ferns.

#### TREXEL

You'll never guess who I found, David, somebody who I should have introduced you to __[stammers]__ [__DAVID:__ Oh no.] days, if not weeks ago.

#### DAVID

Oh no.

#### TREXEL

The one person that can really bring some joy and fun back into *your* work, David, make you more productive, make you a better clone, make y-you a better *employee!*

#### DAVID

Is it Harry? He-- he was nice.

#### TREXEL

No! No, it's not Harry. Harry's not the answer. The answer... is Vice-Admiral Fun.

#### DAVID

W-Who?

#### TREXEL

Vice-Admiral Fu-- You've heard-- You haven't heard of Vice-Admiral Fun? They're always on just after The Face, after The Face does *Facetime with The Face*, you get the *Vice-Admiral Fun Happy Funtime Vice Hour*.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

We all watched it!

_(singing)_ ♪ Ohhhh kids! Heyyyy kids!

You've got a gloomy look on your face!

But Vice-Admiral Fun's coming with haste!

Vice-Admiral Fun is here with games and fun!

Fun fun fun, Vice-Admiral Fun!

Do you wanna play a game? As long as it's theirs!

Vice-Admiral Fun, who's got fun shears.

Cutting down the bush of sadness!

Making it into the shape of a goat, 'cause goats are fun!

As is Vice-Admiral Fun! Yeah! ♫

#### DAVID

_(flat)_ No, I've never seen that program.

#### TREXEL

Ahh, it was alright. But Vice-Admiral Fun is-- is the *one* sure-fire way to get any gloomy goose, like you, __[David groans]__ up and running again.

#### DAVID

Ah-- Okay, well, that sounds broadly awful, so let's, like, table that idea, and maybe do it never.

#### TREXEL

Okay, well, you're in luck, because I've brought them. Ladies and gentlemen, __[David groans]__ Vice-Admiral Fun!

##### [door swooshes open to admit a mechanised unit]

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Appearing today, via mobile hologram unit, live from the Fun Bunker--the most fun, and most secure, studio in the galaxy.

##### [holographic unit initiating]

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN 

Helloooo! I'm so happy to be here! __[gasps]__ [__TREXEL:__ Yeah!] It's so great to meet you, David 7! Ah-hah!

#### DAVID

_(halfhearted)_ Ohhh, you know my name.

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN 

You-- Are you a grumpy-guts today?

#### TREXEL

Yes, yes, they are, Vice-Admiral Fun! They are! They're a grumpy-guts! [__DAVID:__ Um--] Vice-Admiral Fun, um, um, could you-- could you-- could you yell your patented catchphrase that we all love?

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN

__[gasps]__ Well, if it's vice, if it's admiral, if it's fun, then it's *me!*

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ More of a catch-sentence.

#### TREXEL

It is! It's always you! __[clapping, laughing]__ Yay, hahaha.

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk, polite but unconvincing)_ Oh, good. Oh, I'm so glad you're here.

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ Oh, I'm young again. I'm young again.

#### DAVID

Well, we've got a brief to do, so let's get on with that.

#### TREXEL

Now, before we get into that, let's not rush this. __[David sighs]__ Vice-Admiral Fun is here, David, to inject a little bit of pizzazz [__DAVID:__ Mm-hmm.] and zhuzh into our daily work, so Vice-Admiral Fun is really gonna guide us to being better, happier, more fun-eriffic employees. Aren't you, Vice-Admiral Fun?

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN 

Yes. Absolutely. I've got a whole host of fun, fun games that we can play, that show [__DAVID:__ Oh, good.] how much you love each other, how much you love the Board, and how much you love Stellar Firma and working here!

#### DAVID and TREXEL

_(simultaneously)_ Yaaaaay.

#### TREXEL

You know what? Let's start off with a game. [__DAVID:__ Oh-- __[disagreeing noises]__] Let's not rush into the brief. Let's start off with a game to get us in the mood.

#### DAVID

_(incredulously)_ We've got roughly fifteen minutes left, Trexel!

#### TREXEL

But we've got roughly an infinite amount of fun to have!

##### [Trexel cheers, David groans, Vice-Admiral Fun laughs]

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ I can assure you that the amount of fun available in this room is decidedly finite.

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN 

Well, I thought it would be lovely if you gave each other presents. [__TREXEL:__ Ooh!] Imaginary presents from the palace of your mind. *But* the person who gives the present doesn't decide what it is, the person who *receives* the present decides what it is. And they tell the other person, they say, 'Thank you so much for being a wonderful present giver.' So... David 7? [__DAVID:__ Um.] Would you like to give a present? To Trexel?

#### DAVID

It's not-- not really a-- not really a-- Um, here you go.

#### TREXEL

Thank you, David. D-Do I unwrap it now?

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN 

Yes.

#### DAVID

Yeah.

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN

Unwrap it and tell us what you have.

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ Qu-Quickly please. I haven't used much wrapping paper. It's really easy.

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ Okay, uh, unwrapping it... with my *mind.* It's a bow... Who ties a bow?

#### DAVID

I didn't--

#### TREXEL

Has anyone got any mind scissors? I'm not-- Hang on, I'll--

#### DAVID

No, I didn't, no--

#### TREXEL

I'll tear it open with my mind teeth. __[grunting noises]__ There we go. There we go, ah. Ooh. So many layers of mind paper. Here we are. Here we are. [__DAVID:__ Okay, can we just--] __[gasps]__ David! David, it's a beautiful sketch of me, looking wistfully out of a port window. And there's a speech bubble coming off of it, saying--

#### DAVID

_(despairingly)_ Oh no.

#### TREXEL

'Gosh, aren't I the luckiest clone-haver in the world? I love my clone, David 7, and they love me.'

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ You have clearly misunderstood the concept of love.

#### TREXEL

And then if you turn it over, it also has money in it!

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN 

Isn't that wonderful? Well done!

#### TREXEL

Isn't it lovely?

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN 

That's absolutely fantastic.

#### DAVID

It was a--

#### TREXEL

I never knew you thought I felt about you that way, David. I mean, it's a bit overblown, sure, __[David sighs]__ I'm not *that* fond, but it's nice. The sentiment's nice [__DAVID:__ Great.] that you think I feel that way about you. In fact, a little bit sad. I pity you, David, and in many ways, __[David sighs]__ pitying you is the greatest gift you could ever give me, [__DAVID:__ That's not--] so thank you David.

#### DAVID

Started out so well, and then just... __[whistles, then makes an explosion noise]__

#### TREXEL

However, this is mind money, and I would like real money from you.

#### DAVID

No, this is a mind--

#### TREXEL

So if you could just give me so-- No, but you-- you can't promise mind money, and then not give me--

#### DAVID

_(overlapping, through gritted teeth)_ We've already... we've-- we've already gone through the David's Place saving fund.

#### TREXEL

I don't remember that, David, so it can't be true. Can you give me some cash?

#### COIN FRIEND

__[electronic beeps]__ There's nothing left, you fiend! You monster! You took everything! Everything!

#### DAVID

No.

#### TREXEL

I don't know about you, Vice-Admiral Fun, but I don't think David's, uh, playing a very *fun* game here. I think David's being a naysayer. And what do we say to naysayers?

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN 

We say *neigh* to naysayers!

#### TREXEL

Neigh to you!

_(singing)_ ♪ You're a sad horse, and you're turned into glue!

You're a sad horse, so no more with you!

A sad horse doesn't live in a house!

It gets shot behind the barn! Boom! ♫

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN 

Yay! Oh, you remember my songs better than I do, Trexel. Oh, that was fantastic.

#### TREXEL

I do. I do. It was all I had! __[sniffs and re-composes himself]__ Hoo! Okay, right, so I better give a gift, uh, _(crosstalk)_ better give you-- a gift to you!

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ Yeah, yeah, come on, let's just do that, 'cause we haven't got the brief out yet.

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN

_(crosstalk)_ Yes, yes, let's keep going, keep the joy train rolling!

#### DAVID

Keep it quick!

#### TREXEL

Uh n-- Okay, I-- I have forgotten to buy David a gift. Is that a problem?

#### DAVID

No, th-that's... __[sighs]__

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN 

You can buy one right now from your mind shop.

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ Wait, what's... no, Trex--Trexel, quick, what's this? I've just-- No, but I-I--

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ Oh, well, okay, but hang on, it's-- it's Mind-- it's Mind Sunday, so I don't know if the mind shop's open. Hang on, I'll have-- I'll have a check. Hang on.

#### DAVID

No-- no, Trexel, I've-- I've-- I've found--

##### [click, mechanical whirring sound]

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Initiating.

#### DAVID

Uh, I found-- Look, under-- under here. __[pneumatic tube seal breaks]__ Look. Oh look, you've already got me a present, it's, um--

#### TREXEL

Under the mind tree!

#### DAVID

Yes, it's-- it's-- Oh look! It's a brief! Oh, you've got me a brief!

#### TREXEL

What?

#### DAVID

Oh, it's just what I always wanted--

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ I wouldn't do that. I wouldn't buy that.

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ Wait, look, let me-- No, quickly, let me just unwrap it.

#### TREXEL

Vice-Admiral Fun. No, Vice-Admiral Fun, they're-- they're making-- they're making a naughty, naughty sad horse move. I wouldn't have bought--

#### DAVID

Oh look, this-- No, this is-- this is from-- this is from Scarlette. __[Trexel grumbles displeased]__ And uh, and her-- Where she's from is she probably-- she probably shouldn't disclose this. Oh, Trexel, this is-- this is just what I wanted. Thank you so much. __[Trexel gives a series of grumpy noises]__ Anyway--

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN 

Aw, that's lovely.

#### DAVID

--see-- Okay, _(reading)_ so-- so I inherited this shipping company from my aunt. She was totally above board--Hail the Board--and by the book. Since I took over, we've been doing a lot of... not so above board--Hail the Board--things. You know, a little theft, a little moving of illegal goods here and there, just wondering [__TREXEL:__ Sure.] what the ratio of above board--Hail the Board--under the table--Hail the Table--operations has to be before we should just stop pretending to be a shipping company and fully embrace the title of space pirates.

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### DAVID

Oh Trexel, this is-- oh, this is so nice. And we've got a whole, maybe ten minutes to work out this and not be killed!

#### TREXEL

It's a weird gift, David. It's a weird gift that I've given you, [__DAVID:__ Well-- well--] but hey, if I gave it to you, then it must be good.

#### DAVID

And Vice-Admiral Fun said that I had to come up with the present you gave me, so this is what I've decided. Isn't this fun? Isn't doing our mandated work fun!

#### TREXEL

_(interrupting)_ Vice-Admiral Fun, I want-- I want a ruling on this. Is this allowed? Are we allowing this?

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN 

Yes, absolutely. Whatever comes from the wonderful mind palace of the person who receives the gift is correct and right and good and gets all the balloons on their birthday.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ So decrees the judge in this court of fun.

#### DAVID

Thank you, Vice-Admiral.

#### TREXEL

_(on the cusp of a total meltdown)_ Oh, but I wanted *all* the balloons on my birthday! Where are my mind balloons?

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN Well... here you go!

#### TREXEL

__[gasps]__ *(instantly mollified)* Yayyyy! Pop, pop, pop pop pop, pop pop pop, no one has them except me! Hah!

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN 

Right, okay. Well, I think... since David 7 got a brief, I think we should maybe take a look at it, and see what we can do with it?

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk, sighing in relief)_ Oh, thank you, Vice-Admiral.

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ Okay, Vice-Admiral Fun.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

Okay, so, umm... so this is a question which has plagued me before. At what point does your shady underground crime hobby just become your shady underground crime vocation, you know?

#### DAVID

Mm-hmm.

#### TREXEL

Sure, I occasionally break into peoples' sleeping quarters and steal their valuables, [__DAVID:__ Oh, dear.] like not because I'm a burglar, or not because I'm a-- I'm a podbreaker, but just 'cause it's sometimes people are lax in security and it's fun to do. But then when you're doing it every night, and then sometimes during the day when people are at work, and then actually instead of your other work, at what point am I just the best burglar in-- in the universe, you know?

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ When is there so much horseradish sauce that the beef falls out?

#### TREXEL

When's the tipping point?

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN 

Interesting. I'm not sure-- I'm-- That's not really my area of expertise. My expertise is more in fun. So... I would like to hear what David 7 has to say.

#### TREXEL

Yeah, where do you think the tipping point is, David? At what ratio?

#### DAVID

The tipping point of you going--

#### TREXEL

Well, no no no, not-- not me, *particularly*...

#### DAVID

--from being an executive consultant to... just a thief?

#### TREXEL

No, no, no, no, not me-- not me *particularly*. I-- *One's* tipping point. You know, at what percentage do you go from, like, doing some stuff on the si-- When does the side hustle become the main gig, David?

#### DAVID

Well... well. Here's the thing. Th-The problem here is that I-I think what they're-- what they're doing now, um, are-- are not so... um, you know, "Board-approved". Uh, but it seems like they are, oh let's say, following their fun. So... so, Vice-Admiral, if you have-- What if-- what if their fun isn't Board-approved fun? Which *fun* should they follow?

#### TREXEL

That's a good question.

#### DAVID

Board fun or their fun? Eh?

#### TREXEL

And who's better to rule on this than Vice-Admiral Fun? So, Vice-Admiral Fun, given your total commitment to fun and joy and following your bliss, and also your total commitment to the Board and rules and Stellar Firma, if those two are diametrically opposed, __[chuckles]__ which one do you follow?

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN 

Uh, I-- __[coughing]__

#### TREXEL

Okay, they're-- they're turning-- __[Vice-Admiral Fun continues coughing]__ Oh, they're kind of choking.

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN 

Uh--

#### TREXEL

Have you-- Are you having an anaphylactic shock to that question?

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN 

I-I-I think I'm allergic to-- to moral quandaries. Um, __[clearing throat]__ just give me a moment.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ It would appear that the Armada of Fun is aflame with this antinomy.

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN 

Just give me a moment. __[continues to cough wetly]__

#### DAVID

Are you...? Are they...?

#### TREXEL

Are you-- are you-- Oh, god.

#### DAVID

Oh god. __[Vice-Admiral Fun chokes and clears throat]__ They've-- they've swollen up.

#### TREXEL

Oh that's-- that's weir-- Hang on a minute. But-- but-- but Vice-Admiral Fun, __[confused chuckling]__ I mean, how could you have such a-- a strong reaction to this? Surely you come up against these moral quandaries all the time. How to have fun and also _(yelling)_ *total commitment to the Board*? And obedience in all things?!

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN 

Well, I think that whatever the Board says... that *is* fun! And whenever someone suggests that something is fun that is not Board-approved... I come up in hives! It's not very pleasant, and also, I get very phlegmy. It's not pleasant. __[coughs, clears throat]__

#### TREXEL

How-- how much time do you spend sort of swollen and phlegmy in that case?

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN 

It's, mmmm... about, uh, 98% of the time? Possibly?

#### TREXEL

Oh, wow.

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN 

A lot of people think that fun things are not related to the Board in any way, which is completely and utterly wrong.

#### DAVID

Well, except [__TREXEL:__ Sure.] in-- in this specific case where obviously--

#### TREXEL

Yeah, in the case that we just--

#### DAVID

--they're following their fun, and then they're saying it's all-- it's all below... below board. __[Vice-Admiral Fun begins aggressively choking]__ Oh god, no! What if they've gone again!

#### TREXEL

Okay, okay, okay, David, David, stop talking. Stop talking. Vice-Admiral Fun, Vice-Admiral Fun, I think you've misunderstood. Uh, this person, she clearly wants to-- to space pirate in the way that the Board likes. Uh... pirate our enemies, for example, then it would be pirating *and* fun!

#### DAVID

No, that would be space privateering.

#### TREXEL

_(sotto voce)_ Well, I mean, sure David, but Vice-Admiral Fun's gonna suffocate if we don't, you know, coat the pill a bit.

#### DAVID

I'm not really... bothered. You-- you-- *you* brought them here.

#### TREXEL

You're ruining Vice-Admiral Fun. Vice-Admiral Fun was the one thing I had going for me for years and ye-- You know, you're stuck on your own, and the meat pile's started to smell, and you've lost the fork 'cause you were chucking it at the wall so that you could get it to, like, jam in there and im-impress girls and-- and hot boys, and things like that, and-- and-- and then you just chucked it, just sort of like, through an air lock, so you're just eating... stinking meat with your hands.

But then Vice-Admiral Fun's on, and it's all a little bit better! So maybe, David, maybe... you could not *ruin* this for me? [__DAVID:__ Well...] You think you could that?

#### DAVID

Maybe... maybe you shouldn't... shouldn't meet your heroes. 'Cause they turn out to be Vice-Admiral Fun.

#### TREXEL

Yeah, a big puffy mess. A big sad, puffy mess. You alright over there, Fun?

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN

I'm just having a wonderful time staring at the wall. Isn't this wall lovely? I love walls.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Unfortunately, the walls do not love you back. They are just walls.

#### DAVID

I don't think that's tr--

#### TREXEL

Well, that's--

#### DAVID

I don't think they're having a wonderful time.

#### TREXEL

No. No, the smile's gone a bit rictussy. Uh, okay. No, you know what? All is not lost. We can still have fun. Let's just-- let's just-- let's just-- You know what? Let's play another game.

#### DAVID

Ye--

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN

Yes!

#### TREXEL

Vice-Admiral Fun, why don't we-- why don't we play another game?

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN

That's a wonderful idea! Right. My next game is called... 'I've Eaten all the Slurry!' __[gasps]__ Doesn't that sound fun? __[Trexel gasps]__ Doesn't that sound fun?

#### TREXEL

It does sound fun! It does sound fun!

#### DAVID

Right.

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN

Right. So, what we're gonna do is... we're all gonna close our eyes, __[David sighs]__ and someone is going to say, 'I've eaten all the slurry!' [__TREXEL:__ Okay.] But in a silly, silly voice... and the people who didn't say it have to guess who it was!

#### TREXEL

Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

#### DAVID

_(sceptical)_ Okay.

#### TREXEL

Uh, now, my eyes don't close quite as well as they used to, but I'll just put my hands in front of my face if that's okay.

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN

That is absolutely fine. Alright.

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN

Let's close our eyes: one, two, three. __[soft, delighted gasp]__

#### TREXEL

_(immediately)_ Trexel's eaten the slurry! I did it. I did it. Trexel ate it!

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN

Well... David 7, can you guess--

#### DAVID

Yeah, it was Trex--

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN

--who did the silly voice?

#### DAVID

_(deadpan)_ It was-- it was Trexel, and it was his voice.

#### TREXEL

_(incredulous)_ How did you know?

#### DAVID

_(deadpan)_ It wasn't... it wasn't a silly-- it was just a normal voice.

#### TREXEL

How did you know? I was so--

#### DAVID

You said-- you said-- you said your own-- your own--

#### TREXEL

No, that was clearly different.

#### DAVID

You said your own name.

#### TREXEL

Yeah, but it was a double bluff! Like, who'd say their own name?!

#### DAVID

In-- You.

#### TREXEL

_(dawning realisation)_ Oh, and I did. Let's play again. Let's play again. Let's play again. Okay, try again. Try again.

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN

Alright, alright. 3... 2... 1...

#### TREXEL

_(yelling)_ I'm David 7! I'm David 7, and I ate the slurry! Look at me. I'm a stupid slimy clone, and I ate all the slurry! Look at me, David 7!

#### DAVID

__[long sigh]__ It was-- it was Trexel again, because, um...

#### TREXEL

No! What-- No! It was-- I-- It said-- it said David 7, and you said it wasn't a double bluff, so they said they were David 7, so what's your problem?

#### DAVID

Well, you-- you-- you started insulting me, which I wouldn't do to myself, and-- and...

#### TREXEL

Well, you would! Look at you!

#### DAVID

And you-- you-- you still-- you still used your own voice, so it was pretty obvious that it was.... Unless-- Uh, Vice-Admiral Fun, can I-- can I hear your-- your Trexel impression, just to make absolutely sure?

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN

Let's see... it has been a while since I've done impressions on the show, actually. Let's-- let's see what I can do. _(unflattering, grating)_ 'I'm Trexel Geistman, and I love to do things!' __[laughter]__

#### TREXEL

The Board and the fun are not compatible. __[Vice-Admiral Fun immediately starts choking]__ Yeah, there you go. That stopped that. Now, David...

#### DAVID

Trexel, I don't-- I don't think you should really use that against them. That seems a bit cruel.

#### TREXEL

They were doing a mean impression, David, so...

#### DAVID

No, they were-- they were just trying to do an impression. There was nothing wrong. They said you liked doing things. You *do* like doing things.

#### TREXEL

Who says?

#### DAVID

You do!

#### TREXEL

Only Trexel gets to say. I'm a self-determining being, David, and I won't be mocked or made fun of.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ You are a self-determining berk.

#### TREXEL

I'm a noble steed.

#### DAVID

Uh-huh.

#### TREXEL

Look at my hooves! I'm no sad horse. __[David sighs]__ I'm a happy stallion.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Let's make some glue.

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN

Well, I apologise, Trexel, if my impression caused any offence, and I would [__TREXEL:__ Yeah.] like to offer you a bouquet of mind balloons.

#### TREXEL

_(singsong)_ More mind balloons!

#### DAVID

_(sighing)_ Oh, such fun.

#### TREXEL

You know what, this time, I'm gonna-- I'm gonna put my face in the mind balloons and let them bounce off them!

#### DAVID

Oh, pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop!

#### TREXEL

__[emits happy noises that then turn to disappointment]__ I've had an accident.

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN

Oh, dear. Well, let's just move swiftly on from that very odd... interaction, and try another game, shall we? Let's just try another game, that one didn't quite work.

#### TREXEL

Yes, let's push on to another game.

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN

So let's try another game!

#### DAVID

Oh yeah, let's try another game!

#### TREXEL

Lots of these games don't seem to work all that well. Why-- why--

#### DAVID

Let's just push through the pain!

#### TREXEL

Why are the games so bad, Vice-Admiral Fun? Why are these bad games? 'Cause you should be good at this, 'cause you've been doing it so long, so why are the games bad?

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN

Well, I-I think they're good, actually. _(breaking down)_ I think they're very good games.

#### TREXEL

Why? Why do you think they're good? They're-- they're not working. And they're bad. And they're not making David have any fun, and I feel quite hurt, so why are you so rubbish at this? That's-- It's just an honest question, why are you bad at this?

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN

Um, well, um, I, you know, on the show, uh--

#### TREXEL

Yes?

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN

--we have a thing called a script, and I read out the script, and... __[nervous chuckling]__

#### TREXEL

It's *scripted*? But I thought we were just seeing inside your fun Vice-Admiral Funhouse.

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN

Well--

#### TREXEL

It was scrip-- What? Are you telling me it was a lie?

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN

It's-- it's--

#### TREXEL

You're telling me it was a *lie*, now?

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN

It-- it-- it's *inspired* by true life... and my life is very fun... so...

#### DAVID

Is it?

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN

It's very, very fun.

#### DAVID

Uh-huh.

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN

_(on the verge of sobbing)_ I love walls. Walls are good. Walls don't scream...

#### TREXEL

_(disappointed)_ Eh...

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Walls are fine and have no opinion of you.

#### DAVID

Vice-Admiral, what's *your* fun?

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN

I... I don't know. Just whatever the Board says is fun. That's my fun.

#### TREXEL

No, no, but like [__DAVID:__ Ah.] deep down, what's your fun, though? 'Cause we all-- you know, we all hail the Board. We all love the Board. Everyone loves the Board--

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ Oh yeah, love the Board, woo, the Board, yay!

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ I love the Board, you love the Board, everyone loves the Board.

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN

Hail the Board.

#### TREXEL

But, you know, when-- when it's dark at night, and you're just sitting there alone... what do you think, like, 'You know what I'd love? I'd love to be doing this', what's that? What's-- what's your-- what's your bliss?

#### DAVID

Yeah, when you-- when you close your eyes, what do you see on the inside of your eyelids?

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN

I see... an elephant farm.

#### TREXEL

Ooookay...

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Now *that* is a surprise.

#### DAVID

No, let's look. Yes, and-- and-- and what are you... what are you doing in this elephant farm?

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN

I'm... I'm breeding the elephants. I am encouraging the bull elephants to breed with the lady elephants.

#### DAVID

Oh... oh, oh, um, and how--

#### TREXEL

So your dream is--

#### DAVID

How are you-- and how are you doing that?

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN

I'm playing them... sensual music.

#### TREXEL

Okay, your fun's weird, and it makes me uncomfortable.

#### DAVID

No, no, their-- their-- their fun's absolutely fine!

#### TREXEL

That's *weird fun.*

#### DAVID

Well, I mean--

#### TREXEL

What? Hey, she's standing next to a herd of elephants, saying 'Come on, get on with it! Make some progeny, ya sexy, trunked beast!'

#### DAVID

Well? Someone's got to do it.

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN

Yes, exactly!

#### TREXEL

That's true, someone's got to do it, and they found a pervert, Vice-Admiral Fun.

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN

Excuse me!

#### TREXEL

So, Vice-Admiral Fun, what I'm learning here, what I'm learning here is that my childhood was a filthy lie. Is what I'm learning here. I thought I was watching a true and honest account of a real person having fun, and now I find out that it was a scripted, scripted lie conducted by an elephant pervert.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ That is the case with more media than you would imagine.

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN

I don't quite know how to respond to that. I... I never intended for my show to be a lie. I thought that it was a wonderful, magical fantasy that every child could enjoy.

#### TREXEL

I understand why they replaced you with Captain Joy now. __[Vice-Admiral Fun gasps]__ I get it. You know, before I didn't, but I get it now. I get why you were replaced by Captain Joy.

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN

Captain Joy. Captain Joy is the *only thing* in Stellar Firma that is not fun.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Ooh! Harsh words!

#### TREXEL

Okay, seem to have stepped on [__DAVID:__ Oh. Ah.] a little bit of a-- little bit of a hot topic there. Um, they've gone quite red, and those are some-- You know what, I don't know if you noticed, but quite how big Vice-Admiral Fun's fists were before they, sort of, started clenching like that. Um. How about we, ah-- how about we finish off this brief, David? Just quickly finish off this--

#### DAVID

_(quietly)_ Maybe we should get Vice-Admiral to help us. Just-- just maybe calm them down a bit.

#### TREXEL

_(quietly)_ Yeah, yeah, yeahyeahyeahyeah, okay, okay, okay, so, um... _(normal)_ So, Vice-Admiral Fun, moving away from your utter replacement, uh, by Captain Joy--

#### DAVID

_(sharply)_ Trexel!

##### [Vice-Admiral Fun's mobile holo-unit starts whirring threateningly]

#### TREXEL

Sorry. Moving-- Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. Sorry, sorry. Moving, moving-- No, okay, moving away from... anything that I have ever said, um, if you're going to be... a space pirate, you know... [__VICE-ADMIRAL FUN:__ Yes.] in line with the Board, do you think you should just be, like, out and proud, like, 'Hey! I'm a space pirate, and that's okay!'

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN

I mean... pirates are fun.

#### TREXEL

They have fun, fun hats!

#### DAVID

Yeah.

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN

Fun hats! Fun cravats! And fun bats!

#### DAVID

Or a bat.

#### TREXEL

Or a bat.

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN

Space bats. They're-- they're-- they're the-- they're the new, fancy parrots.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN

This season's parrots are bats.

#### TREXEL

_(an aside to David)_ David, I-I think-- I think they're a rambling fool. I'm really sorry, I don't know if I can just let them... "Space bats are the new parrots"? Who'd say something like that?

#### DAVID

I mean, it sounds like something *you'd* say.

#### TREXEL

Oh, it must be pretty good, then. _(normal)_ Well done, Vice-Admiral Fun! Keep going!

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN

Thank you! Yes!

#### TREXEL

Yes, okay, so, so fun space pirates have a space bat instead of a parrot.

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN

Yes, yes, and, uh... their ships have special, uh, jet thrusters that allow them to go through [__TREXEL:__ Mm-hmm.] deep space, so that's [__TREXEL:__ Sure.] wonderful.

#### DAVID

Uh-huh.

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN

And their sails--

#### TREXEL

And when we get to the-- the murdering bit of being a pirate, what's fun about that?

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN

If you're murdering bad people... in a fun way, then that's fine!

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Quis custodiet ipsos pirates?<a id="footnote-1-ref" href="#footnote-1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>

#### TREXEL

Ah, yes, sure, and I-- I mean, just out of interest, when you are swinging over onto a ship, space-laser-cutlass in mouth and, you know, descending upon someone to cut off their head and maybe their hands, at what point do you sort of check in to see if they're a bad person or a good person?

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN

You say to them, 'Do you love the Board?' And if they say 'No', then you cut off their head!

#### TREXEL

What, while you're swinging? You're like swinging over, going 'Do you love the Boaaaard?' and then they've got about, like two seconds to respond--

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN

Yes!

#### TREXEL

--otherwise you assume no, and then slice.

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN

Yes! Exactly. Give them a fair shot at declaring their love for the Board. Two seconds is the Board-mandated amount of time for people to declare their love for the Board and then... heads off! All good!

#### DAVID

Well, it sounds about as fair as anything in Stellar Firma, so that-- that checks out.

#### TREXEL

And pretty fun!

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN

Yes.

#### TREXEL

So.

#### DAVID

I'll just tell this person to--

#### TREXEL

So Scarlette needs to just be-- just be a proud pirate, lose the pretence--

#### DAVID

Get her to get a bat.

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ Be a proud, bat-wielding, person-murdering, question-screaming, head-cutting--

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ Go around screaming questions, cutting peoples' heads off.

#### TREXEL

And it gets the Vice-Admiral Fun seal of approval. So whenever you swing over to somewhere, just say, 'I've been sent by Vice-Admiral Fun!' Slice!

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN

Yes, and make sure to check if they love the Board, and if they do, just... have a party with them! And if they don't, cut off their heads. That's...

#### TREXEL

Fun space party.

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN

That's the Vice-Admiral Fun way.

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ Okay. Okay, well, uh... I think-- I think we're all done here, so you can-- I think you can go, Vice-Admiral Fun.

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ I'm just gonna... pop this.

#### IMOGEN

__[chime]__ Submitting.

##### [whir of panels and machinery]

#### TREXEL

I think you can go.

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN

Well, thank you so much both of you for such a *fun, fun* time!

#### DAVID

_(sarcastic)_ Oh, it was so fun.

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN

Now, which bar are we going to now? [__TREXEL:__ Uhhhh...] Which bar are we going to for the after-party?

#### TREXEL

_(stammering)_ Um, I-- I've got, uh...

#### DAVID

Oh, I don't know. I don't know, Trexel, I mean, I-- I obviously can't leave this room. It's Board-mandated. But *you* can. You should probably--

#### TREXEL

Uhhh...

##### [Vice-Admiral Fun gasps]

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ And Vice-Admiral Fun can go anywhere on a portable holodeck.

#### DAVID

You and Vice-Admiral Fun should go--

#### TREXEL

Well--

#### DAVID

--go to a nice bar!

#### TREXEL

I've got a-- I've got a-- I've got a dancing lesson, I think, which I-- I can't--

#### DAVID

No, you could go to the-- you could all-- you could both *squeeze* into the Asteroid Booth. You know, have a booth together.

#### TREXEL

No, I've got--

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN

Very intimate.

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ I've got a-- I've got a coupon for like-- for-- for--

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ No, no, no, I'm pretty sure-- pretty sure Vice-Admiral could tell you all about their elephant farm.

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN

Yes.

#### TREXEL

It's-- I've just che-- I'm just checking the coupon, it's actually-- it expires in twenty-five minutes, so I've-- I've really gotta-- I've gotta go now.

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN

Well, we can be fast, we can run, we can scoot on over to the Asteroid Booth--

#### DAVID

Yeah! Yeah, though.

#### TREXEL

My legs... my legs don't work.

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN

--and then that's where we'll cuddle up with some elephants?

#### DAVID

No, that sounds lovely, yeah, off-- off you both--

#### TREXEL

My-- No, I...

#### DAVID

Off you both go. Okay, yeah--

#### TREXEL

Oh, okay-- No, Da... David.

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN

Come with meee!

#### DAVID

--no, go on. Go on, just enjoy your evening. Yeah, I'll clean up here, bye, bye! Bye!

#### TREXEL

Da-- Da-- Okay, okay.

#### VICE-ADMIRAL FUN

Buh-bye!
