##### [shorter version of the show theme]

#### TIM

Hello there! Welcome to the first part of the bloopers for Stellar Firma season 2, because, you know what, as polished as the show sounds __[chuckles]__ occasionally there's some *hilarious* mistakes and we've captured that shame and are now presenting it to you like a dog throwing up its breakfast. I hope you enjoy it!

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM [silly voice]

Okay, it's time to do it.

#### BEN [silly voice]

Right, that's warmed up! There we go! Let's off!

#### TIM

It's time for the episode.

#### BEN

Love it.

#### TIM

Okay.

#### BEN

Right. __[sounding more like a cousin of David 7]__ "David 7." Oh god, no!

#### TIM

__[laughing]__ No, that's not it!

#### BEN

"It's gone wrong!"

#### TIM

It's not it!

#### BEN

"Oh, Trexel!"

#### TIM

Welcome back. Season 2, baby! __[Ben laughs]__ Season 2!

#### BEN

__[in a Northern English accent]__ Status quo, now we're Northern. 'Ere we off!

#### TIM

Could I do Trexel...? __[in a Trexel Northern English accent]__ "Um, David. David! I won't 'ave it, David! __[Ben laughs]__ David, I've eaten-- I've drink some moisturiser."

#### BEN

__[in a shrill Northern accent]__ "Oh, it sounds like a farmer who's had his chips p-__[bleep]__-ed on. __[Tim laughs]__ You're p-__[bleep]__ chips, Trexel!"

#### TIM

Uh, let's move back to the Southern accents that __[Ben clears throat]__ we can do.

#### BEN

__[exaggerated Southern English accent]__ That we know and love.

#### TIM

__[exaggerated Southern English accent]__ Good afternoon. This is time for--

#### BEN

__[exaggerated Southern English accent]__ I'm David 7.

#### TIM

__[exaggerated Southern English accent]__ This is the sound of people that unaccountably have power.

#### BEN

__[exaggerated Southern English accent] [laughs]__ And now the news at David 7. __[crosstalk, David 7 voice]__ "Ooooooooh!"

#### TIM

_[crosstalk]_ Ding-dong. Ding-dong. Ding-dong. Ding-dong. Ding-dong. Ding-dong.

#### BEN

"We're not recording."

#### TIM

Yeah we are.

#### BEN

"F-__[bleep]__-ing hell." I'm so sorry, David.

#### TIM

Hi. Hi David! How're you doing?

#### BEN

Okay. David--

##### [transition beep]

#### BEN

__[sings]__ ♪ "David's Flat Corner." ♫

#### TIM

"That's not a thing." __[breaks into laughter, Ben joins in]__ Alright, sing 'David's Flat Corner' again.

#### BEN

__[laughs loudly]__ Ah, first corpse of the series! Here we go! Whoo!

##### [transition beep]

#### BEN

"David, this is ridiculous. Honestly, from one David to another, __[Tim laughs quietly]__ really? Tim Trexel is just really pushing it."

#### TIM

"There was 2 of us here that could have noticed there was no timer."

#### BEN

"I'm not the showrunner!"

#### TIM

Let's stop doing in the audio 'cause it's gonna make it confusing.

#### BEN

"I'm just a performer."

#### TIM

Right. Okay.__ [Ben chuckles]__ Alright, okay.

#### BEN

__[deep voice]__ Yes.

#### TIM

Right.

##### [transition beep]

#### BEN

"'Kay, and a chai latte."

#### TIM

"That's the sexiest kind of... What's a latte? There's too much stuff here that's really specific." __[breaks into laughter]__

#### BEN

"Well, we invented the new brief."

#### TIM

"We did."

#### BEN

"Oh no! Behind the curtain!"

#### TIM

__[laughs]__ "Oh no!"

#### BEN

"So this is our fault really."

#### TIM

This is really our fault.

#### BEN

This is fine.

#### TIM [laughing]

Okay.

#### BEN

We're listing things that are stupid. People are laughing. It's all good.

#### TIM

People are-- Oh, yeah yeah, I'm sure.

#### BEN

People are laugh-- __[commanding]__ Laugh.

#### TIM

Laugh now.

#### BEN

Laugh.

#### TIM

You're enjoying yourself.

#### BEN

Good.

##### [transition beep]

#### BEN

_[crosstalk]_ "Um, sterile. Um..."

#### TIM

_[crosstalk]_ "So let's get a glass ball."

#### BEN

"What?"

#### TIM

"Just a, just a glass ball! Glass is really easy to clean. I should know, I have a coffee table at home that I use for unspeakable things." __[breaks into laughter]__

#### BEN [giggling]

Mm-hmm-hmm.

#### TIM

No thank you.

#### BEN

"F-__[bleep]__-ing and cocaine! __[Tim coughs]__ That joke was so disgusting it killed Tim."

#### TIM

I just thought well, that's, that's sh-__[bleep]__-ing on a table. __[laughs]__

#### BEN

Oh! I didn't even go there! I went immediately to f-__[bleep]__-ing so, I guess...

#### TIM

I mean, I'm still gonna talk about the glass table I have at home and *nothing* sticks to that. People can make their own jokes.

#### BEN

Awful. __[Tim chuckles]__ Just, just awful. Like good, but awful.

#### TIM

Okay.

##### [transition beep]

#### BEN

"To jail!"

#### TIM

"Pop it in the brig."

#### BEN

"Pew! Why did I do--" __[breaks into laughter]__

#### TIM

Pow! Kabam!

#### BEN

__[nonsense noises]__ "Waffle ba baa!"

#### TIM

"Wijous! __[Ben as David continues making nonsense noises]__ Sploosh!" Okay.

#### BEN

"Woof." __[laughs]__ This one's really... __[both chuckle]__ I think fun but definitely got away from us. __[Tim laughs]__ Anyway!

##### [transition beep]

#### BEN

"--that works. A desk."

#### TIM

"Did the clock not work in the old room?"

#### BEN

"No!"

#### TIM

"Did it not?"

#### BEN

"No!"

#### TIM

"Oh. I'm sorry for __[laughs]__ interrupting you."

#### BEN

"Come with me on this one!"

#### TIM

"Okay."

#### BEN

"Trexel."

#### TIM

"Okay."

#### BEN

"Yes and."

#### TIM

"Okay. We'll just say a clock that works."

##### [hand clap marker]

#### BEN

__[laughs as David]__ Unless there is a genuine importance with that.

#### TIM

"Well, I thought that there was a clock and..."

#### BEN

Yeah.

#### TIM

Yeah, okay.

##### [hand clap marker]

#### BEN

No, to be fair, what I said was reasonably nonsensical.

#### TIM

Okay. __[chuckles]__

#### BEN

I mean, it's never stopped us before but it is a good point. __[chuckles]__

#### TIM [laughs]

Oh yeah, 'cause, 'cause otherwise you would-- how would you know that there's only 20 minutes left.

#### BEN

F-__[bleep]__-ing internal clone time.

#### TIM

Internal clone time? You can't just say that, Ben. __[laughs]__

#### BEN

I can. It's improv. That's literally the game.

#### TIM

Then use it. Okay, internal cl-- __[Ben laughs]__ Yeah, okay, in which case tell me you know what time it is and I will say, 'but there's no clock,' and you'll say, 'internal clone time'.

#### BEN

I love it.

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

"We're in the big time, honey bear!"

#### BEN

__[on the verge of laughing]__ "Um, right."

#### TIM

__[laughing]__ Sorry.

#### BEN

"Sorry."

#### TIM

Was it 'cause I called you honey bear?

#### BEN

__[laughing]__ "Yeah."

#### TIM

I'm keeping it.

#### BEN

"Fair."

#### TIM

Right.

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

"Look at my hand."

#### BEN

"Yes."

##### ["Trexel" grunts, "David" cries out]

#### TIM

"Calm down. __["David" cries out and sighs]__ Don't worry. You got some help." __[muppet-like voice]__ You've got some help. Bah!

#### BEN

__[muppet-like voice]__ Oh, baa baa bubbin.

#### TIM

Just gonna pause that there 'cause I realised--

#### BEN

I'm actually a muppet now.

##### [transition beep]

#### BEN

"You were a design consultant."

#### TIM

"Stop touching the table, David. Stop touching the table and running your fingers up and down it. __[laughs]__ It's not for you. __[laugh continues]__ Okay, now. You're doing a little dance now."

#### BEN

__[chuckles]__ Yes. Okay, sorry.

#### TIM

So, __[David voice]__ "David, I just--"

#### BEN

I wasn't doing that! F-__[bleep]__ you!

#### TIM [crosstalk]

One more!

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

"It's tricky, David, and I don't know if you'll be able-- be lable-- be able to do it."

#### BEN

Just slow down a little bit.

#### TIM

__[loud but starting to break]__ No! I will never slow down! That is never an option, Ben! Have you met me?!

#### BEN

Just... put a comma in there.

#### TIM

Okay.

##### [transition beep]

#### BEN

"What's my job then?"

#### TIM

"Your job?"

#### BEN

"Yes."

##### [long beat]

#### TIM

"I don't know. __[Ben breaks into laughter]__ Don't know what your job is in all of this. You're my wingman. You're my wingclone."

#### BEN

__[happy]__ Okay. Yeah. Run with that.

##### [transition beep]

#### BEN

The thing's not running anymore.

#### TIM

I know 'cause I paused it when--

#### BEN

That's fair.

#### TIM

Well, 'cause, you know, we're not doing it right now.

Wow.

Satan would visit me often as a boy. I'd sit in church; he'd sit in a pew not two and a half ahead of me. He'd hover in the air. He'd turn to mother and flick boiled sweets at her eyes. She wouldn't notice. Then again, she was drinking.

I hope you enjoyed the first part of the season 2 bloopers for Stellar Firma. This is the first release in our inter-season programming schedule.

As you may have guessed, there will be a part 2 to the bloopers but that's not coming out next episode! No, it'll be something different and you'll just have to live with it!
