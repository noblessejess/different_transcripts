##### [shorter version of the show theme]

#### TIM

Hello, and welcome to the Stellar Firma season two Q&A. My name is Tim Meredith.

#### BEN

My name is Ben Meredith.

#### TIM

And we play the people on the show.

#### BEN

If you don't know who we play, you shouldn't be listening to this episode.

#### TIM

No. This will be a weird place to start. Stop it! [__BEN:__ Yep.] Stop it now! Go back to one, and I'll see you back here in three to six months. __[chuckles]__ So, we're going to-- We've got an absolute bucketload of questions from our delightful community, so let's jump right in.

#### BEN

Well, actually, to be clear, we have so many questions that we're not gonna be able to answer them all--

#### TIM

Not even slightly.

#### BEN

--'cause that would be like a four hour episode so, yeah, we're--

#### TIM

Nobody wants that.

#### BEN

We're gonna kind of pick out a grab bag, kind of gonna be a bit at random, so if you get read out, great! If you don't, I'm sorry.

#### TIM

We're sorry.

#### BEN

But you-- but you didn't.

#### TIM

But this is actually an exercise in resilience, because you know what? It's not the end of the world.

#### BEN

Yep.

#### TIM

You will live on in our hearts.

#### BEN

And, in order to teach everybody a lesson, that's the end of the episode--

#### TIM

Sorry about that.

#### BEN

--and I hope you've all learned something.

#### TIM

Well, okay. __[Ben chuckles]__ Uh, right. So the first question is from Tomato: 

>"How difficult is it to keep to the main storyline without going off on large tangents? Or has the end goal changed since you started?" 

How do we not go off on large tangents? Well, well, we do.

##### [Ben chuckles, Tim laughs]

#### BEN

Yeah, we-- No, we run a very disciplined show and... end of question.

#### TIM

Yeah. I think that there is a certain element of we've built into the very core and structure of the show the fact that that does not matter, because the main storyline is just, it's dolloped out in little, in little soupçons, and little, little dollops, so that when we spend twenty minutes talking about nothing in particular it doesn't matter.

#### BEN

Yes. We have a vague plan, and then at the start of a season we sit down and we go, "Okay, well that's where we ended up. How do we get to where we want to go?"

#### TIM

Yeah.

#### BEN

And then we kind of work it out from there. Things have changed as we go. [__TIM:__ Mm.] But also just 'cause-- Not because we've gone and said weird stuff that we have to factor in, but also because just our idea of what we want to do has changed.

#### TIM

And also sometimes 'cause we said something weird, [__BEN:__ Oh, yeah!] looked at each other and thought, "You know what? That's better than what we thought."

#### BEN

Yeah. Pretty much. So yeah, it's like a healthy combination of the two. The tangents are the story, right.

#### TIM

The tan-- Sorry, I don't mean to blow your mind, but the tangents... are the story.

#### BEN

Woah!

##### [Tim makes exploding noises]

#### TIM

Both doing hand gestures that won't come across in the-- __[Ben makes exploding noises, Tim laughs]__ on audio format. Pow!

#### BEN

We make it up as we're going along.

#### TIM

Kabloom!

#### BEN

Wow! __[explosion noise]__

#### TIM

Alright, next question. Your choice.

#### BEN

Okay. I'm gonna take a question from eddie sourboy who asks: 

>"Does Trexel have any formal education? He talks a lot about going to school as a boy, but did he graduate? Go to space college? Or is he just guessing about everything all the time?" 

I think, to be more accurate, it's more he's *lying* about everything all the time.

#### TIM

Yes.

#### BEN

But what is a lie except a dishonest guess.

#### TIM

_(laughing)_ It's a guess that you know you're wrong about.

#### BEN

Yeah.

#### TIM

__[laughs]__ I think he's got compulsory education. It is formal, but it's very much you are being, you know, put through a Rube Goldberg-like-- The music __[starts scat singing "Powerhouse" by Raymond Scott]__ would be playing. Who is that? Raymond-- Raymond-- Ray-- Raymond something-or-other.

#### BEN

I don't know.

#### TIM

Somebody will be listening to this and screaming the second name of the composer Raymond "that-guy", who did all of those, like, Looney Tunes songs, but yeah, like--

#### BEN

The Looney Tunes Rube Goldberg machine man.

#### TIM

Loon-- Well, no, Rube Goldberg is a completely different man.

#### BEN

No, I know, but the Rube Goldberg machines are usually what that guy composed that song to. [__TIM:__ Ah.] That song is typical. It's like the Rube Goldberg machine *theme* effectively.

#### TIM

Yes, and I think it's called, like, Powerplant or Powerstation. This is one of those tangents we were talking about, so it doesn't have--

#### BEN

But this is-- we're-- we've factored it into the story __[Tim laughs]__ of the episode and, uh, [__TIM:__ That's the arc.] so that is our craft.

#### TIM

That is our craft! Uh, yeah. So, like, you're forced to go to primary school, but you don't *graduate* from primary school. It just sort of ends, and they ask you not to come back. And I think that's, __[both snort]__ that's what happens. Is that what happens? [__BEN:__ I don't know.] They just send you away at the gates when you're seven years old and say, "Don't come back!"

#### BEN

You think we end primary school at seven years old?

#### TIM

I took a guess, and __[Ben chuckles]__ I got it wrong.

#### BEN

You did it!

#### TIM

I know!

#### BEN

It happened to you!

#### TIM

__[chuckles]__ I can't remember. Like most things, I can't remember.

#### BEN

Twelve to thirteen.

#### TIM

Well, there you go! Asked and answered. Right.

#### BEN

Yeah.

#### TIM

Next question. __[both chuckle]__ Let's go for this one from Faya: 

>"How did David keep getting materials for his hobbies, especially in the expediting basement?" 

So I'm assuming this refers to your crafting materials and various doohickeys.

#### BEN

Uh... yeah. Sure. I mean--

#### TIM

How Ben? How?

#### BEN

Yes.

#### TIM

Answer me.

#### BEN

So-- so, here's a little thing, [__TIM:__ Mm-hmm.] uh, that-- It feels like when people notice details in the shows, and then start being like, "gosh, is that a meaningful decision they've made?" the answer is no. It is--

#### TIM

No, brackets "sometimes".

#### BEN

Yeah. But it's some guff that we've made up, so if there are inconsistencies and mistakes and things that don't quite make sense, [__TIM:__ Mm.] just go with the flow, right.

#### TIM

I disagree. I think what Ben said there __[Ben snorts]__ is in no way factually correct, and I have some deep lore. [__BEN:__ Abject powerless.] I have some deep lore to lay on you. I think--

#### BEN

Oh! Oh, in which case, you'll be fine to field this question.

#### TIM

Yeah yeah yeah. I think what happens--in my truth, personally, for me, for my truth--it's basically stuff's, like, blowing around in the vents, and, like, falling into places and like, you know, it's sort of like a trash basement. You know, a trash hole basement. So, like, just some crap falls through a pipe in the ceiling and David's like, "Ooh! That's kind of like, I don't know, crepe paper." And then makes a lovely paper Bathin. See?

#### BEN

Okay.

#### TIM

Isn't the world a bit more magical now, Ben?

#### BEN

Wow. Wow. __[Tim sighs]__ What a master.

#### TIM

__[laughs]__ I am.

#### BEN

A master of the craft at work.

#### TIM

I'm a craft master. Crafts-man-er as you might say.

#### BEN

_(doubtful)_ Uh-huh. Great! __[Tim chuckles]__ Well. So I'm going to-- Ooh! Ooh, I'm going to ask one from Dusty.

#### TIM

Dusty.

#### BEN

>"Have either of you ever worked in sales? As in: Were any of Trexel's techniques inspired by real-life experiences?"

#### TIM

Oh, dear me. Yes. __[Ben laughs]__ Oh, _(sings)_ ♪ a tale as old as time. __[Ben chuckles]__ A song as old as rhyme. Sales is a hell hole! ♫ Yeah, I've largely had sales-based jobs, because I have no real skills, __[chuckles]__ and therefore, sales is the only place for Tim to make money! __[chuckles]__ I remember when we sat down to plot that, and I think I looked at old documents that I'd had shared with me from old jobs--

#### BEN

You did.

#### TIM

--about, like, sales tactics! And the five steps to sales success! And all those horrifying, toe curling, eye gouging things that you have to look at when you work in a job with any sort of sales, and, yeah, we cribbed them sort of directly from there, and then I did the subtext to them, which is like lying and dishonesty and manipulation. __[laughs]__

#### BEN

Yeah, you turned the subtext into supertext.

#### TIM

It was cathartic! I'm gonna tell you that.

#### BEN

Yes. __[chuckles]__

#### TIM

It was cathartic. Luckily, luckily, dear listener, I now work in a company that, whilst my job has got sales in it, the people that make me do it are nice, and so I get to do it in a nice way with, like, not trying to trick people, __[laughs]__ [__BEN:__ Yeah.] because that's a lot of sales, and it's horrible, and that's why I moved jobs.

#### BEN

So there you go.

#### TIM

So there you go.

#### BEN

Short answer: yes.

#### TIM

In one job, in one job-- I need to talk about this. __[Ben laughs]__ In one job that I got directly out of university because they were like, "Ooh, you're young and stupid", was one of these ones where they were like, "Oh, there's a government scheme where you can get insulation put in the walls of your house". And that's a real thing that happens because the government wants people to have insulated houses. The thing is though, what you need to do is send somebody who has a *bloody clue* what they're doing to your house to check if you should have it rather than giving a drill to an idiot and saying, "drill into this stranger's wall". And people let me do it! And looking back on it, A) I shouldn't have done it, and B) people should not have let me into their house! I clearly had no idea what I was doing! Anyway, that's just something that shocks me, like, once a week, I remember that was my job __[Ben laughs]__ while I was, like, you know, twenty, and think, "Why was any of that the case?"

#### BEN

See, I had a very similar one where there was a government scheme to put solar paneling--

#### TIM

All these schemes! __[laughs]__

#### BEN

--Is put solar paneling. Well, it's because you've got these good, like, subsidies and stuff, but they, you know, they just let any old person 'ave a go at it, and a lot of people spin up companies to take advantage of it.

#### TIM

They really lack follow through on the whole thing.

#### BEN

Yeah. We just sort of-- I was supposed to cold call people and confuse them into getting solar panels put on, and then [__TIM:__ Horrifying.] keep them in a holding pattern, because we were supposed to install them but never did, and then eventually the ex-banker--surprise surprise--owner of the company, folded the company and just sold all of the details to, like, his mate who ran a bigger company.

#### TIM

Oh, wow! You were part of some proper fraud.

#### BEN

Yeah. Yeah.

#### TIM

There you go. Hey kids, don't study the arts! __[laughs]__

#### BEN

He got one of his ex-banker mates to come in and try and intimidate all the students into, like, toeing the line when we were like, "Is this wrong?" and [__TIM:__ Yeah.] he was like, "If you wanna make it in this business..." and at that point I said, "This is nice."

#### TIM

__[chuckles]__ "I don't. I don't want--" __[laughs]__

#### BEN

"I am quitting now. Goodbye."

#### TIM

_(laughing)_ "I don't want to make it in this business. Thank you for opening my eyes."

#### BEN

Yeah. "Also, you as a man, are deeply pathetic, __[Tim laughs]__ and you make me sad in my soul. Bye-bye."

#### TIM

Bye-bye now. Bye-bye.

#### BEN

You're literally shouting at, like, a twenty-one-year-old person [__TIM:__ Yeah.] who's got a temp job. __[Tim laughs]__ What's wrong with you? __[chuckles]__ This is not *The Wolf of Wall Street*.

#### TIM

So what you need to do is you need to study software engineering, and then go work for a lovely company like, oh, I don't know, BAE Systems. You know, something nice and above board.

##### [Ben snorts, Tim laughs]

#### BEN

Uh, BAE Systems for those people who don't know is--

#### TIM

Terrifying defence company. __[laughs]__

#### BEN

Yes. British Aeronautic Engineering?

#### TIM

Yeah. They also do just make planes and stuff. Anyway, we're off topic again! These famous tangents.

#### BEN

Yeah, planes and also missiles.

#### TIM

And also missiles. 'Cause, you know what? What's a missile except a plane where all the passengers explode?

#### BEN

I think maybe actually specifically targeting systems for missiles, [__TIM:__ Could be.] so the things that really make sure the missiles blow the people up.

#### TIM

Okay. So, uh, __[Ben snorts]__ our next question, um... __[laughs]__

#### BEN

That's all part of the story of the episode, okay.

#### TIM

_(laughing)_ It's all part of the story.

#### BEN

We-- we-- We're gonna call-- we're gonna call back to it. It's gonna be incredible.

#### TIM

So this is a question from "many people" and I don't think that's a handle, I think Anil, very helpful collator of these questions, has just--

#### BEN

Just went "loads of people."

#### TIM

"Lots of people." Um, have asked--and I'd be interested to see what you think of this Ben--

>"What was your favourite thing about this season?"

#### BEN

Uh... swole David.

#### TIM

_(laughing)_ Oh, really?

#### BEN

Yeah.

#### TIM

Just *swole* David.

#### BEN

Yeah. And the fact that the detail what we added that he doesn't actually get physically any larger. He just becomes more dense.

#### TIM

_(crosstalk, laughing)_ He just gets denser. __[both laugh]__ Yeah, that is pretty good.

#### BEN

_(slight laugh in his voice)_ And the reason that that was is because we realised that we couldn't have him becoming bigger, because then it has to be, like, something that people refer to, and [__TIM:__ Yeah.] we won't remember to do that. [__TIM:__ Nope.] So we're like externally __[Tim chuckles]__ he looks exactly the same, and here is the definite, sensible reason why that is the case.

#### TIM

So if it gets forgotten, then that's why, and if it gets suddenly mentioned out of the blue, that's also why.

#### BEN

Yep.

#### TIM

We're golden!

#### BEN

Yep.

#### TIM

My favourite bit was where I had to, sort of, work with, I think in the end, both Maddy and Alex to get the sound of--and when I say "work with" I kept saying, "can you do it?" and they eventually said yes--to get the sound of Trexel tobogganing on David down a pile of letters with included slalom movements. That was-- Yes. Apparently, that has given me some notes for season three that run roughly, "Hey, when you think something's funny, that's great, but also think about how much work it will be to soundscape", because that joke took up about as much time as _(begins laughing)_ the rest of the episode put together __[Ben laughs]__ in terms of trying to make it work. Hey kids, don't sound engineer. It seems like a horrifying, horrifying thing to have to do.

#### BEN

I think you and Jonny have managed to get the same note at this point, which is just Alex going--

#### TIM

"Can you make it simpler?"

#### BEN

_(crosstalk)_ "Why are you giving me so much work?"

#### TIM

Yes. Yes, I then-- I also set the previous two episodes in realms full of paper, and again, turns out having to make every movement correspond with a paper rustling noise, lot of work!

#### BEN

Yeah.

#### TIM

Lot of work! People don't like it when you do it.

#### BEN

I mean, actually, to be honest, thinking of that, the other favourite bits was genuinely working with the guests, 'cause they were all great.

#### TIM

They were all great. So great. And I think, I think we'll be seeing some more familiar faces in season three and maybe some new ones? I'll never tell... I mean, yes. Probably. _(fading out)_ Like we're probably gonna...

#### BEN

Moving on! Yeah, let's ask this one. From MuddyHippy which is, "Given the whole molten slurry melting off David's onesie and the subsequent banishment to the Expedition basement--" I got confused. I was like "expediting" but it is "expedition", isn't it?

#### TIM

It is. It is confusing, and we named it badly, and I'm sorry for everyone's trouble.

#### BEN

You're the one who wanted to make a reference to Stalinist Russia!

#### TIM

You always have to make it-- Well, what do you want me to make a reference to, Trotskyist Argentina? That's not a thing! He just lived there. Go on-- On you go.

##### [Ben snorts, Tim laughs]

#### BEN

>"Given the whole molten slurry melting off David's onesie and the subsequent banishment to the Expedition basement, has David 7 been stuck in his loincloth this entire time? He must be so cold!" 

Ah, to assume that David has a loincloth. __[Tim laughs]__ You sweet, summer child.

#### TIM

Nude! __[Ben laughs]__ He's nud-- __[laughs]__ Never comes-- __[breaks into laughter]__

#### BEN

Nude slimy boy!

#### TIM

Yeah, how do you think the slime gets everywhere--

#### BEN

Yeah.

#### TIM

--if there's a onesie in the way?

#### BEN

No. I mean, you remember what we were saying about small details that we just say, __[Tim laughs]__ and then don't really think about. Yes, okay. Fine. [__TIM:__ Good point.] It turns out, we accidentally established a naked David [__TIM:__ Yep.] for the entire time.

#### TIM

Yep. So, you know, that's a little Easter egg for those eagle-eared listeners.

#### BEN

Yeah. Do you know what now? Now that we've had to say that, that's *your* fault, [__TIM:__ Yeah.] and *you're* gonna have to deal with the consequences of your own actions. __[snorts]__

#### TIM

Please forward all of the now alarming art to MuddyHippy@gmail.com. __[Ben laughs]__ That might be somebody's real email address. Please don't do that.

#### BEN

It's definitely somebody's real email address.

#### TIM

Yeah. Well...

#### BEN

Oh, but also-- Sorry. To very swiftly give a more sensible answer, [__TIM:__ Oh, sure.] uh, no. He has a onesie. We forgot. Maybe clones grow onesies out of their skin. Maybe that's something we'll make Maddy soundscape.

#### TIM

__[laughs]__ You heard it there, Maddy. It's Ben's fault when that now happens.

#### BEN

__[laughs]__ Yeah, I didn't get the note. Tim got the note.

#### TIM

Moving on. And-- __[Ben laughs, Tim joins in]__ This question is from Si, brackets "moosearesocool" [pronounced moose are so cool]-- __[laughs]__ It's hard to read words when they're all one word.

#### BEN

Moose-are-so-cool.

#### TIM

Moose-are-so-cool! So that's Si, brackets "moosearesocool": 

>"Did Hartro go to school with Trexel, Bathin and Paxt" Bloody! "Scrum? How long did she--"

#### BEN

I forgot about Paxt Scrum.

#### TIM

Yeah! 

>"How long did she have to suffer Trexel's presence?" 

My serious answer to this is that I get the feeling that they are quite different in age. I think Trexel's probably quite a bit older than Hartro. One of the many indignities that Trexel chafes under is the fact that he's, you know, been doing this for quite a long time and is quite a bit older than most of the other people at his level, and therefore, his line manager is sort of substantially younger than he. So I suspect that Hartro would have gone to school sort of... later.

#### BEN

I don't really have any conception of how old Trexel is 'cause, quite frankly, I don't want to know. He's one of those people that you're like, I just--

#### TIM

He just is.

#### BEN

--whatever the answer is, it's going to be upsetting. __[Tim laughs]__ Like, it doesn't matter what the answer is, but for some reason it will be upsetting, [__TIM:__ Yeah.] so I don't want to know.

#### TIM

It'll turn out that he has an age, but he stole it from a dying child. You know, something like that.

#### BEN

But that's a question as well. Did Hartro go to the same... institution as--

#### TIM

No, they probably wouldn't. They probably wouldn't have, [__BEN:__ No.] 'cause there'll be, like, you know, the consultants and, like, the high end people, and then the line managers, which are sort of like the analogue to the British middle classes, and then there'll be the Build Team school, which is a bit more like a BTech or something.

#### BEN

Yeah, it's like a polytechnic. [__TIM:__ Yeah, yeah.] You'd go to-- Not that those exist anymore. But, you know.

#### TIM

No, no. And not that they were actually worse, that was just some *rank snobbery*. [__BEN:__ Yeah.] But yes, that was-- Sorry, yeah.

#### BEN

It's because you went there to learn to do things with your *hands?!*

#### TIM

What? Do you not have a butler or [__BEN:__ Dis-*gust*-ting!] perhaps large handkerchief?

#### BEN

Yeah. Do you not work in finance, [__TIM:__ Yeah!] you pervert!

#### TIM

Come on! Right, next question. Ben's choice.

#### BEN

Ahahaha!

#### TIM 

_(chuckling)_ Oh! You've discovered a gem!

#### BEN

Well, it's just I think one you're gonna enjoy. From LainyJP: 

>"Tim, do you and Amy sing all the time? Ben, do you also break out in song? And also Ben, what is on your bookshelf? The chat at Gehenna Gaming VHC was obsessed with trying to read your bookshelf."

#### TIM

So let's take this in stages.

#### BEN

Yes.

#### TIM

"Tim, do you and Amy sing all the time?" I sing almost constantly, much to the irritation of Amy up until the point it's something she likes, at which point she joins in with wild abandon. So, it's sort of like if we're giving it, like-- 10 is constantly singing so you never speak, I'm at, like, a 7, 'cause you know, sometimes I'm, like, making work calls--can't sing in them. __[Ben chuckles]__ And then Amy's probably like a 5 or a 6--lot of singing, but a bit less. And Ben, where would you sit on that Beaufort scale of singing?

#### BEN

Probably at a 3? Breaking out in song is not unheard of, but I only do it in very specific situations.

#### TIM

Sure.

#### BEN

To be honest, mostly when talking to you, [__TIM:__ Yep.] in an effort to keep up, __[Tim laughs]__ and sometimes I will sing stupid songs at Rach to annoy her. That's it.

#### TIM

There you go! Asked and answered. Now, onto the second part about books and stuff.

#### BEN

What is on my bookshelf? Just a lot of British white nerd sh-__[bleep]__. Genuinely, like it's one of those things where, through recent events, a lot of people will be like, "Hey, what's on my bookshelf?" and it turns out it's a bunch of white men on mine.

#### TIM

Oh no!

#### BEN

You know, you've got your Ian M Banks-es-- Oh, that's not entirely true. I've got the *Rivers of London* stuff.

#### TIM

That's Ben Aaronovitch.

#### BEN

Ben Aaronovitch. Oh, *The Edge Chronicles*, which are great. I've got, you know, the *His Dark Materials*, Douglas Adams. Oh, I've got *The Dark Forest* and *The Three Body Problem* from Cixin Liu.

#### TIM

Yep.

#### BEN

Oh, a bit of Donna Tartt.

#### TIM

That's not too bad then.

#### BEN

Ehh, it's pretty bad. A shelf of Terry Pratchett. It's also about what the proportion. Like, Ian M Banks, I've got, like, 12 books. Terry Pratchett, obviously I've got, like, 40. __[laughs]__

#### TIM

Yeah, I think Pratchett and Banks, between them, are *really* skewing the numbers.

#### BEN

Yeah, they just really take up an awful lot of space. Like, a bunch of-- Oh, I've got the classic "I used to be an English Literature student". So I've got *The Odyssey*, *The Illiad*, Dante's* Inferno*, *A Christmas Carol*, Hans Christian Andersen's *Fairy Tales*--which I actually bought independently, *The Story of My Life* by Casanova--which is Rach's. We've got a crapload of Philippa Gregory. Rach reads a lot more, like, varied people. Like, I can't just name an author and name like 10 books that--apart from Philippa Gregory--that Rach owns. So... But anyway, there you go. Nothing too exciting.

#### TIM

There you go.

#### BEN

But yeah. There you go.

#### TIM

So I hope you were all bored by that, [__BEN:__ Yeah.] 'cause it's nothing too exciting. Right, this is a question from Lina. The question is: 

>"What do you do when you run out of ideas? __[Ben laughs]__ Or does that just not happen because you're just so good at this! :)" _(reads out the "exclamation mark, smiley face")_

#### BEN

It doesn't happen because Tim doesn't stop.

#### TIM

Well... it does. It does happen. Because, if anyone has listened to the bloopers, you will hear how many times I start speaking, get to the middle or second-third-- Second-third? Yes, yeah the __[stammers]__ third-third. The start of the third-third of the sentence.

#### BEN

Two-thirds of the way through.

#### TIM

Thank you! Two-thirds of the way through a sentence __[Ben laughs]__ and realise I've got nowhere to go with this, and I just sort of either peter out, swear, or yell something. And sometimes, sometimes the yelling just fits right in. But, yes.

#### BEN

To be honest though Tim, that isn't because you've run out of ideas. That's because you've realised the idea you've had is *bad*.

##### [Tim laughs]

#### TIM

That's a good point. Yeah.

#### BEN

There isn't-- It's not like there's no idea there. I mean, I will actually--

#### TIM 

_(crosstalk)_ When you run-- __[breaks into laughter]__ There's always an idea!

#### BEN

I will sometimes run out of ideas. I will stare at you and go-- Uhhhhhhhhhhhhh. Give me a second.

#### TIM

Hang on a mo'.

#### BEN

That'll happen.

#### TIM

Yeah, okay. So I suppose the thing is, we don't run out of ideas, we just often run out of *good* ideas. __[chuckles]__

#### BEN

Yes.

#### TIM

Which is why this is *semi*-improvised and not *entirely* improvised. Right, what one would you like to go for?

#### BEN

We'll go for a simple one. oh hey look at THIS nerd says: 

>"Is the character of Trexel Geistman in any way inspired by Zaphod Beeblebrox? And, do you think they'd get along?"

#### TIM

Weirdly, I think no.

#### BEN

Oh! I was gonna go for yes. Fair enough.

#### TIM

As much as I can see in retrospect, that character, beyond-- And again, who can say, subconsciously, but, like, I'm normally pretty sure of what I'm doing, which is such a broad sentence. "I'm pretty sure of what I'm doing." __[Ben laughs]__ I've only in retrospect been made aware of the fact that yes, he is sort of like a gadabout, allergic to responsibility, space ding-dong. So yes, it is sort of quite similar, but as far as I can think of, I didn't think, "Oh, I'll make a Zaphod Beeblebrox-type," despite the fact we were 100% doing a Magrathea-type thing.

#### BEN

Oh yeah yeah, no yeah. We're not pretending there wasn't any Adams. Also, I think there is one aspect where he absolutely was based on that, [__TIM:__ Oh really?] which is-- Yes, which is where you wanted to have your cocktail? The Flaxen Whisk, because that was [__TIM:__ Ah, yes.] your Inter-Galactic Gargle Blaster? [__TIM:__ Yes.] I think we specifically referenced the Gargle Blaster when we were, like, thinking of what he should be drinking.

#### TIM

That's true, that's true, that's true. But I suppose that was like, "Oh, wouldn't it be good if he had something like..." as opposed to, [__BEN:__ Yes.] "We need a character; let's make him a Zaphod".

#### BEN

Oh, yeah yeah. Absolutely. It's just there's that, like, one little bit where we did.

#### TIM

"And do you think they would get along?" *No!* Like, two egos of that size [__BEN: [chuckling]__ Yeah, god.] would just, like-- It's like when you drop a bomb to put out a fire. They both die.

##### [Ben laughs uproariously]

#### TIM

That metaphor is apt, I say. Apt! Might be a simile.

#### BEN

Oh, too apt.

#### TIM

Too apt. Too apt, bro!

#### BEN

One of-- one of yours.

#### TIM

SamTheQuiche asks: 

>"Are clones important enough to Stellar Firma that they would try to make a clone the ideal human? If so, does Stellar Firma prioritize genetic advantages (better problem solving, more cooperative disposition, etc.) or would they make clones as aesthetically pleasing as possible?"

#### BEN

So, I like that this question has dressed up in many words what is the fundamental question which is, are clones sexy?

#### TIM

Are. Clones. Sexy?

#### BEN 

_(crosstalk)_ Reading between the lines, that is what... that is what's really being asked here.

#### TIM

When a clone walks past, do heads turn and people say "*Dang!* Look at that clone!"

#### BEN

Yeah.

#### TIM

Is that happening? I think clones are incredibly important to Stellar Firma in their function, but I feel like Stellar Firma holds them in complete contempt. Like, I think it's that weird mix of, like, these things mean that we can work at all, but I'm better than you, and I don't care.

#### BEN

It's how you don't pay attention to, like, the paving slabs beneath your feet as you walk along a path.

#### TIM

So therefore, I think the genetic advantages will be like robustness and [__BEN:__ Well, I mean--] replaceability and cheapness. It's like, you know, [__BEN:__ Yeah.] they're like products from the brand Rubbermaid. Like, they're not amazing, but they're, like, tough and utilitarian, and they do the job, and they're not expensive.

#### BEN

I mean also, you can imply how much they value them and what they prioritise them-- with them. First of all, because of the ease with which David could be recycled.

#### TIM

Yes, true.

#### BEN

Because that-- Like Trexel is bad, but Trexel didn't make it easier for things to recycle. He just puts clones in the position where they need to be recycled more often than other people.

#### TIM

Yeah.

#### BEN

And secondly, go back to episode one and listen to the things that IMOGEN begins to instill in David 7 [__TIM:__ Yeah.] if you want to know what the priorities are. I'm pretty sure one of them is classical dance, so--

#### TIM

Could be classical and modern tap, I believe? __[stammers a bit trying to remember]__ No, classical--No, it might just be classical and modern-- I wrote it, but it was two years ago now. I think it's classical and modern.

#### BEN

Yeah. But there are few things there which are more pertinent than the obvious joke which is classical and modern dance.

#### TIM

Yes. But the most important thing--

#### BEN

Which, I mean, it's a joke, but it is true in canon, because we wrote it. [__TIM:__ Yes.] So it's happening now. That is, like, canonically something that, I guess, clones know.

#### TIM 

_(laughing)_ All the other clones can dance... beautifully.

#### BEN

Yeah. It's like bloody *La La Land* out there.

#### TIM

Oh man, in that it should not have won an Oscar! Next question. __[Ben laughs uproariously]__ I believe this is _(laughing)_ your choice.

#### BEN

Yeah. From Mack n Cheese: 

>"During their time in the sales department, David 7 and Trexel were told by each client what animal they would be if they were one. If David 7 and Trexel were animals, what would they be?" 

And I think *you* should answer for David and *I* should answer for Trexel.

#### TIM

Okay, I think David would be... like a minnow. A small, insignificant fish that's always on the brink of being eaten by a whale.

#### BEN

Wow.

#### TIM

Sorry, no. That's just mean. What would-- __[Ben chuckles]__ It would be something quite flighty. Maybe like some sort of slightly emaciated crane. __[Ben laughs]__ Like sort of, you know, they're sort of, like, quite poised and spindly but, like, a bit angular and unsure. Like a-- No, maybe like a concussed crane. Like it *could* be elegant and beautiful, but, because of its many injuries, it is not. __[both chuckle]__ You're a concussed crane. I hope you enjoy it.

#### BEN

I think that Trexel is some kind of, like, really angry crab.

#### TIM 

_(chuckling)_ Get away! __[makes angry crab sound and starts laughing]__

#### BEN

Yeah! 'Cause it's like-- kinda like, acts on instinct, sidles a lot of places. Yeah, is quite bitey, and will lash out, but when you crack through his hard shell, he has an incredibly soft and gooey interior.

#### TIM

And I will die if you crack through my shell. _(laughing)_ Don't crack through my shell!

#### BEN

But by that we do mean, like, not splitting literally Trexel in half. As in, if anybody ever gets to the core of Trexel, he may well just explode out of, I don't know, embarrassment?

#### TIM 

_(laughing, Trexel voice)_ Don't look in there-- Ka-boom!

#### BEN

If anyone allows Trexel to realise the kind of person that Trexel is--

#### TIM

Ooh, no. No, thank you. _(chuckling)_ No, thank you.

#### BEN

Yeah.

#### TIM

Okay, this is a question from Cato AKA Cato: 

>"This season you took two types of submission from the audience (planet pitches & complaints). What was the goal behind that decision and how do you feel it worked compared with Season 1?"

#### BEN

The goal behind that decision was we got to the end of season one and said, "Hey, we did twenty-five planets, [__TIM:__ Mm.] and we don't want to start repeating ourselves, because eventually we will run out of good planet ideas," because, even within a remit as wide as "build a planet" it's still... it's still quite limiting.

#### TIM

Yeah. It can get stale especially when it's, you know, it's you and me, we're on the third episode of a run in a recording session. You want some variety, something to-- [__BEN:__ Yeah.] something to spin off of that's a little bit different.

#### BEN

Yeah, and like, I think we had the two different things because... because I think we planned it in the story of season two, right. We knew that they were gonna get busted down to a different department.

#### TIM

Yeah.

#### BEN

And then it was just a case of like, "Oh, well that would be fun as well, 'cause it means we get to change things up," right.

#### TIM

Yes.

#### BEN

'Cause I think we were both feeling like all of the episodes in season one were, I think, you know, pretty good.

#### TIM 

_(interjects)_ If we do say so ourselves.

#### BEN

If we do say so ourselves.

#### TIM

Pretty good.

#### BEN

But we-- I think we definitely both understood that we were maybe struggling a little bit towards the end. Like, it didn't flow as freely as it did at the start, 'cause we were a bit like, "Oh, well we've kind of done a lot of this stuff."

#### TIM

You've sort of done this. You've sort of done-- Yeah. You start having to quickly check back to see if you've kind of already-- Especially when it's a two-prov... and there's like, you know, at that stage ten hours of materials that you've done. Like ten full hours of talking and you're like, "oh--"

#### BEN

And we can't-- __[Tim laughs]__ Yeah.

#### TIM

Can we remember? No, we can't.

#### BEN

We can't-- No. We can't remember, like, the episode we did previously.

#### TIM

I prefer not to. I like to feel it fresh. [__BEN:__ *(chuckling)* Yeah.] Like, I'm like *Memento* in that way.

#### BEN

You start tattooing episodes on your body.

#### TIM

I do. I do, which is why, after a while, I changed the format, so it looked more pleasing.

#### BEN

Yeah.

#### TIM

'Cause people have also asked-- this isn't the question that we've been asked but there's, like, a question of, like, in season one why the titles started becoming alliterative, and it was because at a certain point I did one and went, "Oh, that's better!" so they're just wildly inconsistent half-way through. __[laughs]__ [__BEN:__ Yeah.] They just change. Changed because I thought, "I want to do that," and nobody stopped me or noticed for quite a while.

#### BEN

There you go.

#### TIM

Right. Next question!

#### BEN

Okay. So, this is a quick one actually. From eden: 

>"Was Enola's name being 'alone' backwards intentional?"

#### TIM

_(surprised)_ No! This is the first I'm hearing of this! __[laughs]__

#### BEN

Well, Helen named Enola so ask Helen.

#### TIM

No, I named Enola. I named Enola.

#### BEN

You named Enola?

#### TIM

I-- I've named--

#### BEN

I thought Helen named Enola.

#### TIM

No. I'm pretty sure. I hope I'm not biting her style.

#### BEN

I don't know.

#### TIM

No, I'm pretty sure because Enola also had a second name that never made it into the show or onto the notes, just through a complete oversight on my part.

#### BEN

What's Enola's second name?

#### TIM

I think it's something like Krautenhammer but yeah.

#### BEN

Oh right. Okay.

#### TIM

Never noticed that it was alone backwards, and that is... apt and kind of freaky, you know. Hey man, if red-- if what I call is red-- looks like red to me, when I say red and you see a different colour, are we talking about red? You know, it's that sort of stuff.

#### BEN

Wow.

#### TIM

Wow. Think about it.

#### BEN

Anyway... __[Tim laughs]__ It's your question.

#### TIM

This is a question from Tescont: 

>"What was the puddle in the expediting office? Did Trexel slurp a clone?" 

So, I think you mentioned this at some point. I can't remember if it was in recorded fashion or if it was just in real life, but no, I don't-- I don't think-- I kind of like the idea that that is the case. That there's a big puddle of, like, clone DNA juice, like, clone medium that just happened to be on the floor for the *whole* of that section and no one realised.

#### BEN

Pretty grim.

#### TIM

But I-- No, I think-- I think that was just a leaky roof fluid, like in an old shack.

#### BEN

Maybe it was-- maybe it was Mez Heckra's assistant.

#### TIM

Oh no!

#### BEN

Who just waited there until they dissolved.

#### TIM

Until they dissolved into nothingness.

#### BEN

Yeah.

#### TIM

But, no. It's-- I don't believe it's-- 'cause the puddle of clone gum that you stepped in in the Sorting Office--

#### BEN

Yeah, it's not very slurpable. It was more of a glue sort of thing.

#### TIM

There was more of a gloopy glue which-- 'cause you know, there's gotta be a lot of polymers in a clone to make it all turgid.

#### BEN

One would-- Yeah, sure. One would assume.

#### TIM

You need to have a-- you've gotta have a turgid clone!

#### BEN

I'm not going there.

#### TIM

__[laughs]__ Coward.

#### BEN

So GarlicBreadandonions, which is a strange combination, honestly. I think. But, you know, each to your own.

#### TIM

Ask the French. I'm pretty sure that's some sort of, like, starter.

#### BEN

Yeah?

#### TIM

Yeah.

#### BEN

Garlic bread and onions?

#### TIM

I think you should open up your bloody horizons, mate.

#### BEN

Fair enough. Sounds like an American thing to me to be honest. But anyway. Anyway: 

>"What are both Ben's and Tim's favourite niche details of Stellar Firma?"

#### TIM

Um, what's a good-- I don't know. I don't know. Have you got anything that comes to mind?

#### BEN

I think, like, it's not exactly a niche detail 'cause it's pretty, pretty in there, but the fact that everyone travels everywhere by tube.

#### TIM

An often tube that is accessed via hatch door in the floor.

#### BEN

Yeah!

#### TIM

There was a beautiful, lost detail that didn't make it into season two because it didn't make sense, but at a certain point we were gonna get busted down again or something like that at the end of season two.

#### BEN

Oh yeah! We were gonna get--

#### TIM

_(excited)_ And we were gonna have a big hammer come out of the ceiling and literally bust us back down to somewhere. __[laughs]__

#### BEN

Yeah. Yeah. We were gonna-- Yeah, we were gonna busted, busted so fast back to down to, like-- Yeah.

#### TIM

To buck private.

#### BEN

Yeah.

#### TIM

Yeah. Yeah yeah, no. That's not a niche detail, 'cause that isn't canon. That didn't happen. There are no ceiling hammers as far as we know. So, yes. So, my favourite niche detail is something that is not really technically a detail, __[laughs]__ because it's not in it. __[Ben laughs]__ I like--and there's a little bit of ambiguity around this, because obviously everything that Trexel says needs to be taken with a pinch of suspicion--but the fact that maybe the reason that Trexel doesn't like Bathin is because they went to school together, Bathin was nice, but Trexel has such a persecution complex that that angered him, and he imagined that Bathin was, like, bullying him, and like has false memories of him, like, giving him swirlies and pulling his trousers down in class or something like that, where Bathin was actually just nice, but you know Trexel's warped, upsetting mind has turned-- has *curdled* that niceness into... into that. Which is why he sort of has this super aggressive anger towards Bathin, but also kind of is aware that Bathin is great? And he should really like Bathin, and Bathin's nothing but nice? [__BEN:__ Mm.] But then, what is truth?

#### BEN

It's also double fake, because also this all took place in like a virtual reality, right? Because...

#### TIM

Yes, we were all in, sort of like, grow tubes with vid-helmets on.

#### BEN

Yeah, you guys just...school pods.

#### TIM

School pod. *Pod school*. Very small class sizes in that it's only your brain.

#### BEN

Yep.

#### TIM

Okay, next _(singing)_ ♪ *question!* ♫ Okay, this is from The Geistman experiment. I think they're a fan. __[Ben snorts]__ 

>"How long did it take you to find the character voices, and do you sometimes struggle to find the voice again after having not used it for a while?" 

...No.

#### BEN 

_(laughing)_ Yeah.

#### TIM

I have found the Trexel voice creeping into my life in a substantial and upsetting way! __[Ben laughs]__ Uh... Because it's too close to my regular voice, it's just _(Trexel voice)_ "me but gravely!" _(normal voice)_ I don't find it hard to find again. Do you struggle to find it again, Ben, and then we'll answer the first bit?

#### BEN

Uh, no. I mean, not to find it. I often find it-- I think I'm getting better at it, but I often find it a struggle to sustain it? Like, I will kind of eventually--

#### TIM

You go Grizzop! You do a Grizzop sometimes!

#### BEN

Well, no, no, I mean, not usually 'cause Grizzop's like quite significantly different--

#### TIM

You still sometimes accidentally do it at the start of a recording session though!

#### BEN

Alright, yeah, well. __[Tim laughs]__ Okay, yeah, no. That's fair. Yeah, no, but it's also like, as we're recording, I'll like, _(David voice, gradually getting deeper and less nasally down into Ben's normal voice)_ "I'll start like really, really obviously, like really up here, and then I'll just slowly kind of drift-- you know, sort of, it'll-- [__TIM:__ There are--] it'll become more natural and then I'll basically--" There was like one episode __[Tim laughs]__ where I was just doing my own voice.

#### TIM 

_(laughing)_ Yeah, we had to be--

#### BEN

'Cause I'm a... 'cause I'm a professional. __[sighs]__

#### TIM 

_(laughing)_ There is definitely some B-roll where you just say things as yourself, and we were like, "I think you might need to do your character voice at some point, __[Ben laugh]__ Ben, because, you know. [__BEN:__ Yeah.] You're playing someone."

#### BEN

Yeah, so that's the thing, I can like, _(David voice)_ "I can always immediately do David. Like, that's fine. It's just remembering to *continue* to do David."

#### TIM

And to be fair, I think there are some points, especially when Trexel is quieter, because a lot of Trexel's character is basically volume and force. _(Trexel voice)_ "So, like he's a-- Ow! All right, this and that! _(quieter)_ But when you go down to sort of a quieter pitch, it's not actually that much different from me just whispering." __[laughs]__ *(normal)* You know, it's not... [__BEN:__ Yeah.] there's not a lot there. It's mostly sort of like... angular-ness of intonation. Like with Trexel it's always like _(jazz scat singing to a rhythm)_ ♪ "Da dee da da! Da doo da dee da-di-da! Dee da! Aha! Doo doo." ♫ You know what, we should do a whole episode where it's just basically, like, interpretive scat singing.

#### BEN

Oh yeah, so we're like: __[random noises in the David voice]__ Aahhh...

#### TIM 

_(joining in the scat singing)_ Di da da!

#### BEN

Ahhhh!

#### TIM

Do da! Ha ha!

#### BEN

Ah ba.

#### TIM

Da dee da!

#### BEN

Aahhh!

#### TIM

Uh! Doooo... Okay. Next question.

#### BEN

Ahh. Wa da da ah we aah we.

#### TIM

Oh no. Hang on.

#### BEN

Oh wha. Mal in ah.

#### TIM

We didn't answer how long did it take us to find them, like, in the first place.

#### BEN

Oh. Uh...

#### TIM

I think Trexel was *relatively*--again, 'cause he's not that different to me--was relatively the same from the start, but we had quite a different... David, didn't we? It was a lot more--

#### BEN

No, I think-- No no no. I think it was-- it was we were doing something, and then Alex said, "Hey, you both sound the exact same."

#### TIM

Yes.

#### BEN

"So do something different."

#### TIM

In fact, yes. I did mine and you were like a very toned down version, [__BEN:__ Yeah.] and then we sounded the same, because the wonderful thing about when you export something as an MP3 is it cuts all of the tops and bottoms, and then there's compression, so all of the volumes get equalised, and then everything sounds like everything else because of audio magic.

#### BEN

Yeah. We didn't struggle to find it. It's more we tried one thing, were told "that doesn't work", so I was like, "Okay. So I'm just gonna do Richard Ayoade then."

#### TIM

Yeah, yeah.

#### BEN

"Okay. I will just do Richard Ayoade then."

#### TIM

Ayoade this thing right up.

#### BEN

Yep.

#### TIM

Right. Next question.

#### BEN

So this one's from Indrid: 

>"Can we get a quick pronoun run-down of the main characters? Yeah, it'd be super helpful to know who goes by what!"

#### TIM

And there's an interesting foible in this one, but I'll mention it when we get to it. I'll mention it when we get to it, which might be pretty quickly. So, Trexel's definitely a he/him. David's an interesting one that I mentioned earlier--I hope you remember--because I think to start off with you were sort of... he/him, but then asserted your gender as David.

#### BEN

Yes.

#### TIM

And then obviously the fandom has very much sort of got behind the, you know, you know, "Third gender is David," sort of-- No, or "there's two genders: David and David," things like that, you know.

#### BEN

Well that's effectively... I mean, "gender is David" is like pronouns are no. Like, don't use pronouns.

#### TIM

Exactly.

#### BEN 

_(carefully and thoughtfully choosing his words)_ But then obviously, yeah, this is one of the... the issues with the improv'd thing. And also, to be honest, us not thinking it through, like, from the off. [__TIM:__ Mm.] _(uptalk)_ Because we've *never* really established pronouns for David? Like, I think obviously we default to he/him because I, Ben, uses he/him? [__TIM:__ Yeah.] And I'm playing David, and we're looking at each other when we were doing it? So...

#### TIM

And I've known you for quite a while, [__BEN:__ Yeah. You know.] so the he/him is quite indelibly marked into my old brain.

#### BEN

Yeah, and we never-- Yeah, we have never said, like, "Okay, well, this is what David's pronouns are." [__TIM:__ Yeah.] And, like, obviously I said the-- I did the David thing, first of all, because, like, it was a funny joke, but also because, you know, why would he have a conception of what gender, because-- I think I've said this before, but gender is a social construct, and David has not been part of that social construct? [__TIM:__ Yeah.] So... you know.

#### TIM

Yeah. So, the joke is he would say "David" because he doesn't know what he/him or she/her or they/them is, he's just...they're just David.

#### BEN 

_(uptalk)_ Well also, not only not knowing what they are, but not seeing... very much the point of it?

#### TIM

The point, yeah. Yeah. But it is so hard to get *away* from pronouns. Like, even in that sentence [__BEN:__ Oh, no. Of course.] I was like, "He thought he was gender: David." It's just-- it's very, very difficult to get away. [__BEN:__ Yeah.] And as you say, it was never... it's more sort of emerged by accident. Having said that, I'm very much not unhappy that we've ended up with a character that is sort of a little bit more... gender agnostic or, you know, gender question mark, because-- Hey! That's a nice thing to have in the show.

#### BEN

Yeah. Yeah, I definitely don't want to pretend like we've specifically and purposefully done something here.

#### TIM

No!

#### BEN

It's like, no, this is-- It's grown out of circumstance, but yeah, like definitely it's also influenced, like, the way, like, David in my head is that-- Like, yeah broadly, David is broadly genderfluid now! [__TIM:__ Yeah.] Because... he'll probably answer to he, they, David...

#### TIM

Yeah, and is a clone. So... may have no identifiable sex organs of any kind!

#### BEN

Yeah, we don't know.

#### TIM

We don't know!

#### BEN

We don't know what junk is going down in his trunk. All we know is that--

#### TIM

And he's never looked inside his loincloth.

#### BEN

Actually, I... have.

#### TIM

Have you? Have you?

#### BEN

Yes, I think there is a specific, in episode-- in season one, at some point I think I look down my trousers. [__TIM:__ Oh no!] And I react to something! But we don't know what that thing is.

#### TIM 

_(crosstalk)_ But we don't know what! Maybe it was just a happy little face.

#### BEN 

__[giggles happily]__ Maybe it was.

#### TIM

Hartro, yeah, I think is a she/her. Standards, I think is more specifically a they/them. And I think that was again, because-- less to be like, "Hey, look, we've got, you know, not-gender-specific characters," but more, like, if I'm thinking about it conceptually, they're the kind of characters who are like... "This is not a thing." You know. "This is not a concern of ours. [__BEN:__ Yep.] Thank you very much." So.

#### BEN

"Not important to our identities, thank you very much."

#### TIM

Exactly. Exactly. Yeah! And--

#### BEN

But also, to be clear, not in like a dehumanising way, [__TIM:__ No, it's just--] 'cause obviously, like, their names-- Well, 'cause their names are Number 1 and Number 48, so you can definitely, like, read it like that, [__TIM:__ Yeah...] but that's definitely not the intent, so.

#### TIM

It was much more an idea of, "Would they be male? I don't know. Would it matter? Would they be female? I don't know. Would it matter? Well, shall we just avoid pronouns? Okay." [__BEN:__ Yeah.] 'Cause you know, it's like why must one assign one when it kinda doesn't matter to anything to do with the plot or story or world or character? [__BEN:__ Yeah.] So there we are. So, we're--

#### BEN

Yeah. They are nonbinary individuals who are cohabiting.

#### TIM

Yeah. And it's very possible--

#### BEN

And definitely in a relationship.

#### TIM 

__[chuckles]__ Yes, an *increasingly tense* relationship. __[Ben laughs]__ And it's very possible--'cause again, we haven't planned any of this out--it's very possible we've committed some faux pas, or accidental like, "Oh, did you not know this is actually a thing within this world that is, you know, bad or misunderstood", so if there is anything like that... do let us know.

#### BEN 

_(crosstalk)_ Yeah, that is one thing. Please tell us! Yeah.

#### TIM

Because we are ignorant. __[laughs]__

#### BEN

Yeah.If we've got an opportunity to learn, grand!

#### TIM

Yes. And we have had a couple of very helpful people where we have misgendered someone in a suggestion who have said, "Hey, you've misgendered someone," and this meant we could just skip back, and I do a quick 3-second re-record, and Maddy pastes over the mistake and, uh, yeah! That's quite helpful! Thank you very much to those who have done that, though I can't remember their name right now! Right, let's do--

#### BEN

Well, more-- more-- we'll do more characters.

#### TIM

Oh gosh! There's more characters!

#### BEN

Right, do we have any-- Well, I mean, obviously at this point we've characters who I don't think we've really established... much at all of?

#### TIM

No.

#### BEN

'Cause, like, Clytemnestra Cairn--

#### TIM

I think they were cast as a she/her.

#### BEN

Yeah. Enola, I don't think we actually establish any...?

#### TIM

Have not established anything there yet. IMOGEN is an interesting one, because IMOGEN is a she, but probably in the way that like a ship... is a she.

#### BEN

Yeah.

#### TIM

'Cause... robots!

#### BEN

Well, the same way that, like, Cortana is a she. [__TIM:__ Yeah.] And well, I mean, basically most bloody AIs in shows because-- ugh.

#### TIM

Which I-- Isn't that something around? Like, I seem to remember when they were doing the GPS things, and it was something like they used women's voices because men didn't like taking instructions about directions from another man? __[Ben splutters]__ They were like, "I know what I'm doing!"

#### BEN

Gah, men are just so pathetic.

#### TIM 

_(laughing)_ Yeah yeah! It was something genuinely, like, they just responded very badly, __[Ben gives a disheartened sigh]__ 'cause it's like, "No, no! I know where I'm going! Thank you very much GPS." Turn it off. __[laughs]__

#### BEN

Good grief.

#### TIM

Now, I'm sure there are plenty of men who are fine taking in driving instructions from anyone, anyone that would offer them but, uh, yes.

#### BEN

Yeah, but the fact that it's a significant enough portion [__TIM: [laughs]__ Yeah.] for them to make that change is pretty damning.

#### TIM 

_(laughing)_ There's an economic imperative to do that is quite upsetting about the human race.

#### BEN

Yeah.

#### TIM

And men in particular.

#### BEN

But then also, like, I guess, Harry's a he/him.

#### TIM

Harry's a he/him. Mez Heckra, probably he/him.

#### BEN

Yeah, but again, had like one speech, so...

#### TIM

And was probably dead when we heard it. So there you go!

#### BEN

Almost definitely.

#### TIM

Okay, Bumble. Sluuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuurp- many U's in there: 

>"What tv shows/ movies exist in the Stellar Firma verse? Do they have any new ones? Anything left over from Earth time?"

#### BEN

Nothing left over from Earth time very specifically.

#### TIM

Fragments of archival footage, tiny bits here and there that they, you know, misinterpret because there's no context around them.

#### BEN

Yeah. And enough for Trexel to get humorously wrong.

#### TIM

Yes, enough for Trexel to get access to Tim's Twitter feed and do a nature walk where, because-- I have a problem. I filmed things in nature, and did commentaries as Trexel to them. You know, that sort of stuff.

#### BEN 

__[laughs]__ But also, like, we very specifically wanted to avoid making, like, explicit references? [__TIM:__ Yes.] And, like, we have-- I think we made it clear. Maybe we didn't actually. I don't know. But like, we have rejected suggestions, because they're too close to, like-- or making too much reference to Earth.

#### TIM

Yeah. Like, I think one referenced Queen Elizabeth II specifically, and it's like, [__BEN:__ Yes.] "Why would we know who that is at this stage? That was two thousand years ago, and the planet blew up with all the files on it."

#### BEN

Yeah, and it's not to the extent where-- Like, obviously we can't completely divorce ourselves from it. 'Cause, I mean, in fiction, Stellar Firma originally came from Earth, but also we are two people who live now. So, you know, it wouldn't be very interesting to be like, "And a washing machine." "What's a washing machine?" "Okay, well, [__TIM:__ Yeah.] let's get into that." Or avoid the concept of washing machines and make up some space-neologism for it.

#### TIM

And that's very much an improv thing, because there is a good old improv rule of, like, when somebody introduces something, it's kind of quite difficult to deal with it if everytime they introduce something you go, "I don't know what that is. What is that? I don't know what that is." Every now and again, sure. I'm pretty sure we've had a couple of things where you've not known what something is, and it's led to a fun explanation.

#### BEN

We have had some very inconsistent knowledge on David's part [__TIM:__ Oh yeah!] precisely because of that. Because when it's funny for me to ask, "But what is this?" [__TIM:__ Yeah.] he does, but he will know about everything else. [__TIM:__ Yeah.] Until it's convenient for him to not know about something again.

#### TIM

And that's, I think, that's something that a lot of, shall we say, more well-thought out fiction is guilty of. Because it's so difficult when you're like, "Oh, this person has, I don't know, amnesia or like this, and they don't know anything!" It's like, "Oh, no no, but they know everything that's, sort of, useful for general st--" Like, there's huge categories of things that they know all about, but they don't know the thing that's really, sort of, important for the plot in a very specific and kind of quite unbelievable way.

#### BEN

Yeah, in a very convenient way. __[chuckles]__ But we didn't really answer all of that question.

#### TIM

What was the-- Oh yeah! We do have new ones because of the holovids.

#### BEN

Yeah, we've got holovids. We've got, like, the wrestling planet [__TIM:__ Yeah.] was specifically to supply that. We had the romance novelist who--

#### TIM

And we had, like, the buckets of blood channel, I think, like in the very-- in the first season.

#### BEN

Yep. I think the broad thing is that, yeah, a lot of entertainment-- I mean, we have the Winter Lettuce Collective, [__TIM:__ Yep.] who make music. Made music.

#### TIM

And probably movies.

#### BEN

But I think, basically, what we have is the consistent rule is that any new media is upsetting.

#### TIM

Because Tim had to think of it whilst being Trexel.

#### BEN

Yes. I mean also, we do have David's Fact Corner, the hottest new... IMOGENcast from--

#### TIM

Nope. Cancelled. David's Fact Cancelled. We heard.

#### BEN 

_(disappointed)_ Aww.

#### TIM

But for patrons, it's David's Fact Ongoing. Along with Trexel Geistman's Unarguable Histories of the Earth.

#### BEN

Yes, David's Facts Sporadically Ongoing. We should probably record some more of those.

#### TIM

Probably. Probably. __[Ben chuckles]__ There's a schedule, and we're fine.

#### BEN

From Si (moosearesocool): "Is calling spirograph a 'graph friend' a British thing, Meredith thing or a Stellar Firma thing?" It is a thing that meant we didn't have to use Spirograph™, [__TIM:__ Yeah.] but everyone knew it was a Spirograph.

#### TIM

Do we think the Spirograph people are coming after us? No, I think we're probably fine, but it would be weird for there to be brand name Spirograph in this world.

#### BEN

Yeah, as we previously said, we try to not be very specific. Unfortunately, I wanted to make a very specific reference __[Tim chuckles]__ so I was like, yeah sure, they've probably got, like, some sort of Spirograph-thing going on. And it's also funny when you call it a Graph Friend.

#### TIM

It is funny when I call it a Graph Friend. __[laughs]__

#### BEN

Yeah. It's a convenient inconsistency again on our part.

#### TIM

Ooh, that should be some sort of a thing. Convenient inconsistency. That's a good phrase.

#### BEN

I mean... that's politics.

#### TIM 

_(chuckling)_ Ka-boom.

#### BEN 

_(chuckling)_ Oh, yeah.

#### TIM

Yeah, here's one from Dr Teatime _(pronounced Tay-AH-Tim-May)_: 

>"Stellar Firma is very bleak when you stop and think about it- #truefacts. Do y'all have any guidelines for yourself to keep it from getting too dark or do y'all just feel it out?"

#### BEN

The second one.

#### TIM

Second one. Yeah, there is definite-- there's definitely-- and I think one of the things I remember from bloopers season one is, "Too dark! That's too dark." __[chuckles]__

#### BEN

Yes.

#### TIM

There is definitely a lot of you follow-- 'cause the themes are quite dark, and the setting is quite dark, and the situation is quite dark, and so often improvising stuff you just say something, and you're like, "Aww, you know what? We're supposed to be here for a good time. So let's not talk about this, I don't know, genocide or something." [__BEN:__ Yeah.] So I think the guideline is, "Do you say it and then immediately feel regret?" [__BEN:__ Yeah.] If that happens, probably don't go in the show.

#### BEN

'Cause yes. Yes, I mean this is a comedy, but as people say, "it's not a very happy one".

#### TIM

No.

#### BEN

Umm, it's pretty... pretty grim.

#### TIM

Pretty grim!

#### BEN

But sci-fi dystopias tend to be, and if we made all happy, it wouldn't really be doing a service to that idea.

#### TIM

But hey, I'm sure it'll all be fine in season three. Yeah? Yeah?

#### BEN

_(crosstalk)_ Yeah. Yeah, it'll be grand. Yeah, it'll be brilliant.

#### TIM 

_(sounding worried)_ Oh *no!*

#### BEN

David will get away; it'll all be brilliant. He'll end up in Bathin's arms. You know, it'll be this lovely, just complete paradise. And yeah. So you guys keep believing that, okay?

#### TIM

Yep!

#### BEN

Cool. Yeah. Nice.

#### TIM

I think we might've ruined Christmas. I don't know how, but I think we've ruined Christmas.

#### BEN 

__[laughs]__ We've gone full Scrooge. Okay, well this is one I'm gonna kinda give an honourable mention, 'cause we've basically already answered it. brinnanza: 

>"So like what's up with Standards; are they married?" 

I mean, they're definitely in a relationship. [__TIM:__ Mm.] Are they married?

#### TIM

Consciously coupled, perhaps.

#### BEN

Yeah. Like, you know.

#### TIM

Is their marriage-- Oh, hang on a minute! Clytemnestra established this. If they have drunk each other's blood, then yes!

#### BEN

_(chuckling)_ Yes.

#### TIM

If they have not, then no! And that's your answer.

#### BEN

And actually, to be honest, thinking of Number 1 and Number 48 and how they are with each other, they have definitely drunk one another's blood.

#### TIM

Sure. Sure.

#### BEN

I mean, Number 48 has, like, a special murder hammer so... __[Tim laughs, Ben is barely holding a laugh in]__ they are the kind of person who has probably drunk somebody's blood.

#### TIM

That was-- No, you know what? I've changed my answer to a previous question. My favourite niche detail is that Number 48 has a special murder hammer that they love. __[Ben chuckles]__ They're like, "Ooh! I can get the hammer!" You know, Slammy, the torture hammer. __[Ben laughs]__ Yep. Yep, yep, yep, yep.

#### BEN

Yeah, okay. Shannon asks: 

>"If there have only been 7 Davids, and Trexel got *all* of them, does that mean Trexel basically got his own clone batch to ruin?"

#### TIM

I think there are runs of clones, and they go out for each need. So like, if somebody else was ruining clones as quickly, then I think Trexel might have got, like, Davids 1, 5, and 9. But the thing is, most people take care of their clones, so yes, Trexel basically gets his own lines of clones, but only because he's going through the stock so quickly that he's basically buying up the whole batch, as it were.

#### BEN

Yeah, it's not that the David line is specifically Trexel's line of clones, it's like the David line is the currently active line.

#### TIM

Yeah.

#### BEN

But Trexel's burned through them in, what? What have we established, like seven weeks? Less than seven weeks?

#### TIM

Something like that. The timeline of the show is *intensely* short.

#### BEN

Yeah.

#### TIM

Which I kind of like. Maybe that's my favourite niche detail. No, Tim, commit to one niche detail. It's the hammer. __[Ben laughs]__ The hammer is the one I like.

#### BEN

And you've already changed it once.

##### [both laugh]

#### TIM

I have. You know what? It's something else. So I think it's, yeah, not intentionally, but yes by accident. And they're not to ruin. He's not supposed to ruin them. They're not his to ruin, but they are ruined.

#### BEN

Well, I mean, they're dead.

#### TIM

I'm gonna do my own honourable mention and then my proper question. My honourable mention is from Silene. [__BEN:__ Oh, fine then.] I believe it's pronounced sih-len or sih-lon: 

>"To the closest dozen. How many murders has Trexel committed?" 

_(slight pause between words)_ *None have been proved!* Next question. __[Ben laughs]__ This is interesting, and I can't remember a lot of this, so I'd be interested to see if Ben knows. This is from suspiciouslygay: 

>"to ask the real questions here, where on earth is Trexel's long lost brother?"

#### BEN

_(confused)_ Who?

#### TIM

Who?

#### BEN

Who?

#### TIM

Do I have a long-lost brother? Did I mention I have a long-lost brother?

#### BEN

I mean, I assume so, because they're asking a question about it.

#### TIM

Hmm. Hmm. __[Ben laughs]__ Well, maybe this isn't my full question, because I was hoping Ben would be like, "Yeah. Oh, yeah. Do you remember? Remember this?"

#### BEN

No! I have no idea. I mean, you had a clone that got taken away but your long-lost brother? You might have to dig into the archives and--

#### TIM

I have to dig into the archives.

#### BEN

--maybe we'll have to find that detail and bring it back for season three.

#### TIM

Yeah. Yeah.

#### BEN

Maybe it's just me doing a Trexel voice.

#### TIM

_(laughing)_ Oh no! __[Ben laughs]__ How awful. How awful-- But would Trexel's brother actually be really quite nice?

#### BEN

Yeah, but with his voice.

#### TIM

And again, it just really, really compounds the point [__BEN:__ Yeah.] that Trexel is just the f-**[bleep]**-ing worst. __[chuckles]__

#### BEN

Yeah, it's like, sure, you had bad circumstances sunshine, but you chose to be like this.

#### TIM

Okay. Yep, I think that's probably enough for one lifetime.

#### BEN

Yes. Well, sorry to those we didn't get to but like--

#### TIM

There were loads of you. There's like sixty questions here.

#### BEN

Yeah, genuinely we got through about a third of them so... I mean, although we'll say, "oh, and then you'll have a three-hour long episode", and then people will be like, "yes, we want that", but honestly--

#### TIM

You don't. We'll run out of steam--

#### BEN

We'll run out of steam.

#### TIM

--by about two hours in, and then it won't be fun anymore. So, thank you very much for joining us for this season two Q&A. Obviously, we will be having some Q&A's at the end of season three, so if you wanted to ask a question or your question wasn't read out, don't worry. You only have about nine to twelve months to wait, so the time will just fly by if you consistently relisten to Stellar Firma on as many different devices as you can locate. So it's goodbye from Tim. Goodbye.

#### BEN

And it's goodbye from Ben. Farewell.

#### TIM

You had to make it different, didn't you?

#### BEN

Course I did, because you tried to make--

#### TIM

You couldn't just--

#### BEN

You're the one who set the thing up! You're-- you started doing a thing!

#### TIM

This is over now!
