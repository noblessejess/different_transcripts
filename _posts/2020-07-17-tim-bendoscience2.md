summary: 'Tim and Ben do SCIENCE Again! <br/><br/>Welcome to this bonus episode of Stellar Firma, where Bryn Monroe (Hamid on Rusty Quill Gaming) delves into the symphony of factual inaccuracy that is Season 2 to find out just how much Tim and Ben know about science… take 2! <br/><br/>Correction- At one point Bryn makes a slight error and says that a Planck length is "10 to the -34 metres"; a Planck length is 1.6×10^−35 m.'

##### [shorter version of show theme]

#### BRYN

Hello, and welcome to Stellar Firma interseason content-- bonus content, I guess. I, today, am your host, Bryn Monroe, and I am joined by the two stars of our wonderful show, Stellar Firma, who are...

#### BEN

Peering out of this big present __[mouth trumpet noise]__ is Bonus Ben!

#### TIM

Walking incredibly slowly through a thin sheet of tin foil, it's Tim Meredith.

##### [Ben chuckles, Tim makes an explosion noise]

#### BRYN

That's right. These guys have asked me back once again. Much like the interseason content between seasons one and two, we're here for more, yet more, Tim and Ben Do Science.

#### BEN

I didn't ask. I thought we were doing episode one of season three but he's just here, so I guess we're doing this though.

##### [Bryn laughs]

#### TIM

No. No. No. No. Mainly for the reasons we haven't plotted it yet, so I don't know what would happen!

#### BEN

Sh-sh-shut up, Tim! __[Tim laughs]__ Keep it behind the curtain. [__TIM:__ Eh.] It's like everyone-- No one knows we have no idea what we're doing.

#### TIM

Look, I've got an incomprehensible page of notes somewhere which should serve.

##### [Ben and Bryn chuckle]

#### BRYN

I'm pretty sure that's how you function, and also how Stellar Firma functions. So...

#### TIM

Yep!

#### BRYN

So, I think the first thing that's really important is to address the massive, dead elephant in the room.

#### TIM

Mm-hmm. Stinky!

#### BRYN

In season two, David and Trexel, of course, moved out of Planet Design. We spent fifteen episodes in the Sales Department and then approximately ten--more like eight, I suppose--episodes in the Complaints Department.

#### BEN

Yeah, we became really lackadaisical with the idea of __[Tim chuckles]__ doing our jobs at that point.

#### BRYN

Yeah, I mean, you didn't start off great, but it definitely got worse the more __[Ben chuckles]__ episodes we've racked up.

#### TIM

Look, you can always go downhill if you've got a good enough shovel. Remember that.

#### BRYN

And one of the key changes, at least from my perspective, about the shift in departments in season two is there's been a lot less science.

#### TIM

Less science. Mm.

#### BEN

Mmm.

#### BRYN

You don't design planets anymore, so you don't have to [__BEN:__ No.] talk about the details of how a planet might work.

#### TIM

Well Bryn, isn't everything science? Really? When you get down to it?

#### BEN

Yeah!

#### TIM

Isn't-- isn't--

#### BEN

Yeah.

#### TIM

Isn't everything science? So...

#### BEN

The science--

#### BEN and TIM

_(simult.)_ Of love.

#### BRYN

Uh, yes. I think literally everything is science, but I was first invited on the show-- I won't go through the entire academic qualifications spiel again. It's a good clip, but it's from--

#### TIM

You can listen back.

#### BRYN 

_(simult.)_ It's in the first one.

#### TIM 

_(simult.)_ It's in this feed.

#### BRYN

Go and listen to Tim and Ben Do Science, Part 1.

#### BEN

Fundamentally, to recap, as far as science go: Bryn got loads, we got none.

#### TIM

Mm. Mm. Mm.

#### BRYN

Yeah, but importantly my specialisation has always been astrophysics and cosmology.

#### TIM

Yes.

#### BRYN

Therefore, I very much don't look into, say, the sciences of psychology or sociology or, you know, business studies. There's some science in business studies, right?

#### BEN

Writing-ology.

#### TIM

Yeah. As we know from lazy journalism, a "scientist" does science. So, if it's a science of some kind [__BRYN:__ Yeah. Yeah.] and you are a scientist, then come on and talk about global warming, even if you have no idea what it is.

#### BRYN

So, I guess, you know, you could bring on, say, a teaching expert or a business expert--

#### TIM

Could do.

#### BRYN

--to analyse, for example, Trexel's Ten Step Program to Sale Success and criticise that from--

#### TIM 

__[stammered interruption noises]__ Uh, "Sales Domination", Bryn.

#### BRYN

Sales Domination, of course.

#### TIM

Thank you.

#### BRYN

Sorry. __[Ben chuckles]__ And criticise that from a perspective of informed understanding.

#### TIM

Yeah.

#### BEN

Nah, they'll definitely come in and be like __[Bryn and Tim laugh]__ "This is A-okay!"

#### TIM

I love it! Profits up!

##### [Ben chuckles]

#### BRYN

But... yeah. But that's really not my position so I'm gonna comb through the episodes of season two for tasty, little scientific morsels, [__TIM: [smacks lips]__ Mm. Mm.] which I'm then going to expand into giant feasts of [__TIM:__ Oh, delicious...] just things I like talking about, basically, __[Tim chuckles]__ while I occasionally ask questions that I hope you guys don't know the answers to __[Tim chuckles]__ so that once again I look really intelligent, 'cause that's how it worked last time.

#### TIM 

_(sing-song voice)_ There's no subtext; there's only text, Bryn-- Ben. __[laughing]__ Sorry Ben. What were you gonna say?

#### BEN

How much of this is you going "Well, you made a throw away comment to this one thing, so, um..."

#### BRYN

Well--

#### BEN

"That's the episode!"

#### BRYN

I've got my two pages of notes here, Ben, [__TIM:__ Ooh!] __[starting to laugh, Ben chuckles]__ so we shall find out!

#### TIM

Alright.

#### BEN

Okay.

#### TIM

Let's throw the metaphorical shrimp onto the metaphorical barbie.

#### BEN

Yep. I've got a beer. I've got a cold one, so I'm ready to go.

#### TIM

I've genuinely got a pot of moisturiser--E45 brand--just next to me __[Bryn laughs]__ so if I get--

#### BRYN

He's holding it up to the camera.

#### BEN

Drink it. Drink it. Drink it.

#### TIM

Mm. Hang on, I'll just... __[unscrews the moisturiser lid]__

#### BEN

Suck it down!

#### TIM

Just unboxing it. Ooh! Can you smell that? You can't 'cause this is audio.

#### BRYN

No... no, that's not how... these things work.

#### TIM 

_(simult.)_ Point one of science: can you smell through a microphone?

#### BEN

_(simult.)_ Wait, was that science? Did he do a science?

##### [Bryn laughs]

#### TIM

The answer: maybe.

#### BEN

Yeah.

##### [Tim and Ben chuckle]

#### BRYN

No--

#### BEN 

_(simult.)_ We just don't know!

#### TIM 

_(simult.)_ Let's teach debate!

#### BRYN

We just proved that you can't.

#### TIM

__[chuckles]__ Okay.

#### BRYN

So, yes, our corporate masters have decreed that we continue a successful thing from the past despite the massive context change, which is obviously very appropriate to Stellar Firma, so we will plunge on. And in fact, Tim has managed to lead me directly into my first point, because in episode 26 itself, the client, who we are not *designing* a planet for but hopefully *selling* a planet to, establishes themselves very early as a big fan of the scientific method. So, my first question is: what do we think the scientific method is?

#### BEN

Stay at home. __[Bryn and Tim laugh]__ Stop the virus. __[laughs]__

#### TIM

I know! I know! I've got an idea. You may have your satire, Ben, but I think I have the answer.

#### BEN

Ah-- mm. Tim. Tim. That was very generous.

#### TIM

What-- __[laughs]__

#### BEN

It was not satire.

#### TIM

_(laughing)_ It was just saying things that have happened.

#### BEN

I made a reference and, uh--

#### BRYN

A joke about current events, therefore, satire.

#### TIM

I've listened to *The Now Show*; I know how it works. For people outside of the UK, *The Now Show* is a moderate to poor satire show. __[Ben laughs]__ So, the scientific method is you conduct exp-- When you're tryna find out about stuff, you don't just go "I saw a thing and, therefore, x equals y", you say, "Okay, I've got an idea that a thing might be a thing, so I'm gonna go into a 'lab environment', which is some sort of controlled environment, and do tests and compare them and use controls and, therefore, through 'scientific means', work out what is likely and what is not." Maybe not what's true! Because what is truth? But have a rigorous controlled way of working things out that stands up to scrutiny. Science.

#### BEN

Uh, mine's just hypothesis, experimentation, conclusions.

#### TIM

No, I preferred mine that took a minute and a half to say.

#### BRYN

I mean, you've basically said the same thing, but Ben said it with better words.

#### TIM

_(defensive)_ Shut up! __[laughs]__

#### BRYN

So...

#### BEN

Yeah.

#### TIM

He's got more degrees than I have.

#### BEN

I did it.

#### BRYN

__[laughs]__ I guess, __[Ben laughs]__ in this case, the points go to Ben. Are we doing points? We did points last time, right?

##### [Tim groans]

#### BEN

We're doing points because I just got the first one.

##### [Bryn laughs]

#### TIM

_(frustrated)_ It's all happ-- it's happening again! I knew this would happen again!

#### BEN

So, 'hypothesis' as Ben says, or 'when you think a thing might be a thing' as Tim said, __[Tim laughs]__ is--

#### TIM

I'm more intelligent than I sound.

#### BRYN

--fundamentally true.

#### TIM

I swear to you. _(laughing)_ Please, believe me! __[Ben laughs]__ Buy my magic beans.

#### BRYN

The scientific method is essentially-- I mean, I think of it as, you know, as a framework for learning more about the universe we live in, [__TIM:__ Yeah.] but yeah. Exactly what it is is probably debatable from a philosophical perspective, but the conduct of the scientific method is, as Ben says, you have a hypothesis and you test it in some way. So, you mentioned Tim, going into lab conditions [__TIM:__ Yes.] to do that, which is interesting because that's not *necessarily* an absolutely vital part of the scientific method. If you're testing your hypothesis, you are doing science.

#### TIM

Okay.

#### BRYN

The third stage that Ben has mentioned, is also really important, is the conclusion. You have to use the test results that you have to basically refine your hypothesis. Tim, you mentioned going into lab conditions to do your test. Now, why do you think we do that? Why do you think we go into lab conditions to conduct experiments and tests of hypotheses?

#### TIM

'Cause things are complicated. So let's say-- The really good one I remember is there is-- I can't remember where it is, but basically they use old salt mines. Like the most lab condition place I can think of is when they're trying to detect, like, deep space particles and stuff [__BRYN:__ Yep. Yep.] and, like, dark matter and all that kind of stuff, there's so much stuff going on, like, so many cosmic rays and... you know, atoms, let's say, flying about the place __[Ben snorts]__ that when you've got really sensitive equipment then you basically, you can't hear it over the static, so you go down a giant, great salt mine into the earth, where it's still quite noisy but less noisy, and you basically use that as-- and that's slightly a lab condition. It's a more controllable environment where you've got less crap going on.

#### BRYN

Absolutely. Absolutely.

#### BEN

I would say broadly the same thing, but I'm gonna say the word "variables" __[Tim laughs]__ and thus win it.

##### [Bryn laughs]

#### TIM

You! Urgh! Hang on a minute, I've just realised something. All I need is a thesaurus and then I can win.

#### BRYN

__[laughs]__ No, I'm gonna give the point to Tim that time.

#### TIM 

_(feigning indifference)_ Eh. __[laughs]__

#### BEN

Noooooo!

#### BRYN

'Cause he talked about detecting deep space particles--

#### TIM

Yeah boy!

#### BRYN

--in salt mines, and that makes me happy.

#### TIM

I've been listening to Bill Bryson's *A Short History of Nearly Everything*, so I'm--

#### BRYN

Oh, I love that!

#### TIM

Oh!

#### BRYN

It's so good! Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's real good, that.

#### TIM

Now, can I remember most of it? No, I can't. The main thing I remember is geology doesn't agree with any other part of geology. __[Bryn laughs]__ That's about where I've got to. __[Ben laughs]__ And people, like, nicked each other's fossils loads.

#### BRYN

That is an excellent book to read if you feel like knowing more about, well, stuff basically. But yeah, the big takeaway is the world is really complex. I think, you know, the clip that got quoted most from our last special was "planets are big y'all".

#### TIM

They are.

#### BRYN

And this time I would say that "stuff is complicated y'all".

#### TIM

__[laughs]__ Now you're gonna get two gravestones just so they can both be carved.

#### BRYN

That's my grand plan. __[Ben laughs]__ That's my grand plan.

#### TIM

Double epitaph Bryn they'll call him.

#### BRYN

And so, yeah, lab conditions or any other kind of restriction on a testing environment is to basically, as you say, reduce the noise, reduce the other variables that might be interfering. Like, most of our hypotheses are relatively simple. You know, we say 'well, if this thing, then this thing'. You know, it's a simple causal statement between one variable and a result. And that's really hard to test, because in any situation, you're gonna have *so* many variables and they could all be interfering, and if you're not keeping a very tight control on a bunch of them, then they're gonna change your results--so not the thing you actually want to test. So, we use a lab of some kind or, you know, a testing facility or whatever it looks like--you do your best to reduce extraneous variables, reduce the complicating factors and pare things down to just the relationship you want to test.

#### TIM

Which, as you can tell in our episode, we did because we're in a room with just two people, so that's a lab.

#### BRYN

Well, apparently not. According to Trexel in that very episode--

#### TIM

__[softly chuckling]__ Oh no.

#### BRYN

--is my next question is: what does a scientific lab look like? What does Trexel state __[Tim groans]__ is the one really essential element of a science lab?

#### TIM

Beakers! Uh... __[laughs]__

#### BEN

Oh! I reckon I know.

#### TIM

Bunsen burners.

#### BEN

Uh, a white coat.

#### BRYN

Point to Tim. __[Tim cheers]__ Yeah. Yeah. Apparently, Bunsen burners __[Tim laughs]__ are the one thing that makes something a science lab.

#### TIM

I just like I get a point: What do you-- what is a thing that you said, recorded and __[Bryn laughs]__ then listened back to three times during an editing process? Well done, Tim. You got it on your *third* go. __[Bryn laughs louder]__ Yes! Nailed it!

#### BEN

__[laughs]__ You just started naming things that you found in science classrooms.

#### TIM

__[laughs]__ That one kid who sets fires to things!

#### BRYN

The points are completely arbitrary. Ben won last time, but if I can make the score 1-1 after season two, [__TIM:__ Ooh.] then I figure you guys will be morally obligated to invite me back at the end of season three!

#### TIM

We can have a *Mighty Ducks 3*. Yeah.

#### BEN

Nah, we're gonna bring you back for-- __[Bryn laughs]__ You're gonna host "Tim and Ben do Poetry". __[Tim laughs]__ And then we'll get Anil to do "Tim and Ben do Specifically Physics".

#### TIM

And then we'll get Helen in for "Tim and Ben Speak Languages that Helen Doesn't Speak". _(slightly panicking)_ I couldn't land the joke because I don't know what languages she speaks. Um... um... Ancient Samaritan!

#### BRYN

I will add that Anil knows a lot about a lot, and he could do __[chuckles]__ this episode on almost any topic [__TIM:__ Oh man.] other than, you know, planetary physics probably--

#### TIM

Handsome and smart? Pfft.

#### BRYN

--which is one of the fewer bits I know more about than he does. Yeah, so I don't know why Bunsen burners specifically. You did also, interestingly, you did mention in that same episode beakers as another fundamental [__TIM:__ Yeah!] part of science labs.

#### TIM

Love a beaker!

#### BRYN

And Ben, yeah, white coats. White coats, probably not necessary. In fact, what do you think the purpose of a white coat in a science lab is?

#### BEN

It's so if you spill stuff on you you can tell.

#### BRYN

Yeah. It-- Well, it's PPE. It's not, you know, scientific equipment as such.

#### TIM

I've got an idea as well. And I-- You know what? I might be wrong about this, but I imagine a lot of white coats are worn because people wanna be like "Hey look, I'm a scientist!" And that's a genuine-- I think a lot of times, that kind of-- I think with doctors in America is the most-- Like, doctors in England, they don't wear white coats *at all*. Whereas doctors in America, like consultants, wear them to be like, "Hey look! I'm a big important senior doctor!" But they're not helpful. In fact, they transmit infection, and they try and make people not wear them. Does much go on like that in more, like, lab-sciencey world? Are people wearing coats when they _(stage whispers)_ don't really need to wear a coat, _(normal voice)_ but they've got a nice coat.

#### BRYN

It's certainly possible, isn't it? I have to confess I've never worked in a science lab. I couldn't tell you for certain.

##### [Tim sighs dramatically]

#### BEN

If Rach wanders past at any point, she used to be a lab manager, [__TIM:__ That's true!] so I'll ask her.

#### BRYN

Oh, very nice. Yeah.

#### TIM

Yeah.

#### BRYN

I'm pretty sure the white coats are PPE rather than equipment though.<a id="footnote-1-ref" href="#footnote-1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> Bunsen burners and beakers though, I mean, this is very much the "British schoolboy" understanding __[Tim chuckles]__ of a science lab. What kind of science do you think you'd be doing if you in fact had Bunsen burners and beakers?

#### BEN

Maths.

#### TIM 

_(laughing)_ Yeah, maths. __[Tim and Bryn laugh]__ Can't set fire to a book without a Bunsen burner, Bryn!

#### BEN

Exactly.

#### TIM

Think it through! Think it through!

#### BEN

And you can't distill the numbers to drink the number juice!

##### [Tim and Bryn laugh]

#### TIM

Now we need to take a titration of the number six and put it into a three mole solution of the number eight. That's right, I'm listing all of the terms-- Nobody adequately explained a mole to me!

#### BEN

It's the strength of acid.<a id="footnote-2-ref" href="#footnote-2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>

#### TIM

I-- Sure! Now people can--

#### BRYN

A mole?

#### TIM

Yeah. When I was in secondary school, I failed science very badly. I got you--

#### BRYN

A mole is a specific number of atoms.

#### BEN

Oh. I thought it was the strength of the concentration of acid.

#### BRYN

I mean, you could use it as a concentration of acid in terms of moles per litre, I think.

#### BEN

Ah.

#### TIM

That was it.

#### BRYN

But a mole specifically is 6.023 times 10<sup>23</sup> (ten to the power of 23) atoms if I remember Avogadro's number correctly.<a id="footnote-3-ref" href="#footnote-3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>

#### BEN

Alright.

#### TIM

Thing is, if somebody had said, "Tim, moles are about Avogadro's number", I'd've been like, "Hold the goddamn phone, that is an amazing name, explain this to me further." __[Bryn chuckles]__ But they didn't. They said, "Shut up, Meredith", and I didn't learn anything, and I failed science. __[laughs]__

#### BEN

I also like the idea, if you explain or if you describe the concentration of acid in terms of moles, if I am correct, all they're doing is pointing at that beaker and saying, "That acid has *loads* of atoms in it. Just *so many* atoms."

#### BRYN

_(crosstalk)_ Yeah, pretty much.

#### TIM [laughing]

So many atoms!

#### BRYN 

_(laughing)_ Yeah, yeah.

#### TIM

Okay, so it's number of atoms of a specific type that you're measuring in comparison [__BRYN:__ Yeah.] to other atoms that aren't that atom.

#### BRYN

Yeah, potentially. A mole is just a number. You know, so you can be measuring it in [and] of itself, or in comparison to another thing.

#### TIM

Fine, but why did no one explain this to me when I was an angry, irritating child? _(laughing)_ I can't tell why.

#### BRYN

I can only imagine. But my question remains, what kind of science can you actually do with Bunsen burners and beakers? 'Cause you can't do astrophysics, I'll tell you that much.

#### BEN 

_(using a funny, husky-ish voice)_ It's chemistry.

#### TIM 

_(mimicking Ben's funny, husky-ish voice)_ It's chemistry.

#### BRYN

Yeah, basically what you're just doing there is you're going to be studying chemicals. You're going to be studying-- And there's various different branches, you could be doing metallurgy. But it's wonderful that that was immediately where Trexel went when asked to create a scientific environment, [__TIM:__ Yeah.] because, to me, that shows that he's been brought up in the British school system of the late 20th century.

##### [Tim laughs]

#### TIM

Yeah, we're doing science which means just chemistry. __[laughs]__

#### BEN

Hang on a minute, Bryn. Are you saying, *are you saying* __[Bryn laughs]__ [__TIM:__ Preach, Ben. Preach!] we draw on our own life experiences and don't subsume ourselves completely into the characters of these people who live in __[breaks off into incomprehensible mumbles, Tim joins in]__ the year of our Lord, Stellar Firma?

##### [Tim laughs]

#### BRYN

The year of our *Board,* Stellar Firma.

#### BEN 

_(simult.)_ Oh, oh. That's good. Steal it.

#### TIM 

_(simult.)_ Ey? Ooh. Ben, you're fired. Bryn, you're on board.

##### [Bryn laughs]

#### BEN

Okay! See you later. How good's your nasal voice, Bryn?

##### [Bryn laughs]

#### TIM

I remember there was-- I'm just going to be nicking things in the Bill Bryson book now, but there was a thing where there was a physicist and he said very unkindly--might've been Bertrand Russel, somebody fancy like that<a id="footnote-4-ref" href="#footnote-4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>--and he said that "Physics is science, everything else is stamp-collecting", and just dropped the mic and walked away. It-- Ah!

#### BEN

To be quite honest, that's just a classic physicist. They're all like that.

#### TIM

They are real bitchy! Physicists are really bitchy!

#### BEN

They are! They are so-- I used to live with a physicist and my-- [__TIM:__ *(laughing)* Catty physicists!] my *god,* the incredible level of arrogance __[Tim laughs]__ that comes with a physicist is just extraordinary.

#### BRYN

Look, as a theoretical physicist, I naturally understand the entire universe and everything in it.

#### TIM

He's put a crown on! He's put a crown on!

#### BRYN

And therefore, I'm entitled to a certain level of arrogance over any other person. __[Ben laughs]__

#### TIM 

_(laughing)_ Where'd that ermine robe come from? And that sceptre!

#### BRYN

The other thing that's mentioned in the same episode is the need for a sterile environment, __[Tim "hmm"s in agreement]__ and Trexel suggests a giant glass ball.

#### TIM

Yeah!

#### BRYN

Because apparently glass is inherently sterile?

#### TIM

Easy to clean. It's wiped down, certainly.

#### BRYN

So, what do we mean by a sterile environment, and how do you achieve a sterile environment?

#### TIM

Bleach. Cover it in bleach. __[chuckles]__ A sterile environment-- yeah, it's an environment that you keep free of interfering detritus, whatever you want to call that--maybe it's microbes, maybe it's dust. You know, it's clean. Clean room.

#### BRYN

Okay, yeah. I'll give you a point for successfully describing a sterile environment.But how do you achieve a sterile environment?

#### BEN

Hang on a minute, I didn't get __[stammers]__ the possible-- the option!

#### TIM

No, sorry. Yeah, this-- __[chuckles]__ the way we--

#### BRYN

You'll have to jump in before Tim one of these days.

#### TIM

--the way we play it now.

#### BEN

Do you know how difficult that is?! __[Tim bursts out laughing, Bryn joins in]__ Do you know how difficult that is, to speak before Tim does?

#### TIM

Especially with the delay. I have set this Skype call up so that I always have five seconds before you. __[Ben laughs]__ Put an artificial delay on Ben. Sorry, Ben.

#### BRYN

You apparently won't be able to use the same tactic you used last time, of just waiting for him to say something wrong and then coming in with the correct answer.

##### [Tim laughs, Ben makes a sound of resigned agreement]

#### TIM

Lying in wait!

##### [Ben chuckles]

#### BRYN

So how do we achieve a sterile environment?

#### BEN

There are many methods. __[small pause] [Tim laughs]__ I mean, genuinely. Boil it, microwave it, X-ray it, like, there's lots of ways. Do something what kills the pathogens.

#### BRYN

Yes, point for that. So sterile is normally in reference to specifically microbe contamination. So you're right, the purpose of making something sterile is to avoid contamination of something, and Tim has raised some of the things that might be considered contaminants, such as microbes but also stuff like dust. Sterile is normally in reference to removing microbes. So it's more important generally when conducting biological research or medical research rather than say, metallurgic research.

#### BEN

Yeah, I'd love to see a virus on a sword being like, "Nailed it. I made it."

#### TIM 

__[laughs]__ Yes! Question--

#### BRYN

Because the things you're testing for-- you know, if you're testing biological things, it's more important to get rid of biological contaminants. If you're testing, you know, mineral objects, then it's more important to get mineral contaminants. And yeah, the normal way of, say, achieving sterility in a standard lab of the kind that is described in that episode would be to boil the things inside them.

#### TIM

Just everything. Fill it with water. Heat it up.

#### BRYN

Physically, your glass ball is in no way naturally sterile, [__TIM:__ Okay.] and you're probably going to have to boil it to make it sterile. Wiping it down with bleach would also not hurt. You might want to do that first.

#### TIM

I say, when you say 'not hurt', it depends how careful you are when you're wiping the entire room down with bleach. But I take your point.

#### BRYN

Well, indeed. Indeed.But also, depending on exactly what you're testing, of course, the presence of bleach in the air of the lab might also be considered a contaminant.

#### TIM

I was testing if bleach was in things, and I've covered everything in bleach! Ahh! __[Bryn and Ben chuckle]__ So here's a question. Here's a genuine question, if say, like, the sterility and contamination is a relative thing, so you know when they did that thing where there was those two Bell radio lab technicians and they spent a year trying to, like, clean out the interference from some broadcast equipment and it turned out they'd accidentally discovered the background radiation from the Big Bang. [__BRYN:__ Yes.] Would that count as like, 'well, it's not a sterile environment'? 'Cause you've got all of this-- you know, what you're looking for can't be found, because the environment is causing interference in whatever *tests* you happen to be running?

#### BRYN

Good question.

#### TIM

I mean, they won a Nobel prize for that, but sure, it wasn't what they were hoping for.

#### BEN

I mean, it's technically not sterile but, uhh, good luck.

##### [Tim laughs]

#### BRYN

So once again, sterile is not quite the same-- is not quite the right word, because what we would refer to in that case in a physics experiment of that kind is it's-- you've got what we would call a noisy environment.

#### TIM

Oh! Okay.

#### BRYN

Essentially, where you're attempting to detect some sort of signal and we call an unwanted signal "noise". [__TIM:__ Hence, yes.] So that-- And noise can occur-- In astrophysics, you know, we're often measuring radiation from the sky, whether that's light radiation, heat radiation or, indeed, microwave radiation. And we call unwanted radiation "noise" in that context.

#### BEN

So, what would you call the perfect environment? Like a silent environment.

#### TIM

What's your perfect Sunday?

#### BEN

Would it be a silent environment, or would it be a sterile? Or, like, uncontaminated?

#### BRYN

Yeah, I think uncontaminated is probably a broader term, because that covers, like, a sterile environment for certain types or a sil-- yeah, I guess a silent environment for different types of research. Now, uncontaminated is, you know, an ideal. There's an old joke about physicists solving problems. A physicist asks which comes first, the chicken or the egg. And they say, "Well, I've got a solution but it's only true for a spherical chicken in a vacuum." __[Tim laughs]__ A lot of physics is about answering questions in completely imaginary perfect conditions which you can't achieve in the real world, and that's a really good example of it. The radiation they discovered is referred to as the cosmic microwave background. It is indeed a bunch of radiation that is *literally everywhere in the universe* and was created, I believe, 300,000 years after the Big Bang, [__TIM:__ Well, how--] for reasons I won't go into.

#### TIM

_(simult.)_ I was gonna say, how does that work? __[laughs]__

#### BEN

_(simult.)_ I was gonna say, what happened there then?

#### BRYN

I could give you a *very* detailed history of the early universe but it might take a while.

#### BEN

There was a secondary pop!

#### TIM

Yes. The Smallish Bang.

#### BRYN

No, the 300,000 years is a different thing. I think it might be 3 seconds. I might be remembering my--

#### BEN

That is a-- Okay, I know in terms __[Bryn laughs]__ of the age of the universe that's not very long, but that is quite long.

#### BRYN

That is... yeah.

#### BEN

Relative to us.

##### [Tim laughs]

#### BRYN

Certain key points after the Big Bang which, you know, like the important ones, and I may be confusing which is which. __[Tim gasps]__ The key point is-- is just after the Big Bang the universe is incredibly hot, and when it's that hot nothing can really exist. And the cosmic microwave background is created at a point where it reaches a certain level of coldness--or, well, not hotness, I guess, 'cause it's still really hot--for essentially photons to start existing in a meaningful way.

#### TIM

Right.

#### BRYN

And photons are the particles that make up all electromagnetic radiation, and the cosmic microwave background is a form of electromagnetic radiation. So, the point is--

#### TIM 

_(crosstalk)_ If I was a betting man, I'd say that was a 3 second-- it'd be weirder for the first 300,000 years of the universe protons did not exist.

#### BEN

Ph-photons.

#### BRYN

Photons.

#### TIM

Photon-- Shut up! Everybody shut up! I tried to say something smart and it backfired! __[laughs, Ben joins in]__

#### BRYN

Wait, I mean, when I say they couldn't exist is... they would have been there, but they would've been being constantly created and destroyed [__TIM:__ Oh! Right.] at this exact stage, and I cannot remember the exact time off the top of my head, I'm afraid. They basically-- the universe becomes cold enough that photons can start to pass through the universe rather than constantly being absorbed and re-emitted by everything else that is there.

#### TIM

Fair.

#### BRYN

So, yes. This cosmic microwave background is everywhere in the universe all the time. So, the idea of having an environment where you filter this out is basically impossible. You could shield yourself from it--

#### TIM

The salt mine.

#### BRYN

--but that's actually very difficult to do if you're trying to send a signal any distance at all, [__TIM:__ Yeah.] you know, like, outside a single room, then you can't shield from this background.

#### TIM

Unless you have a very *thin* but very *thickly* shielded pipe and a good line of sight and the earth isn't curved.

#### BRYN

Yes, I mean--

#### TIM

_(slightly laughing)_ Under those situations. I'm a physicist. If you've got a flat earth, [__BRYN:__ *(laughing)* Yes.] and go with me here 'cause the phrase flat earth [__BEN:__ Oh, don't. Yeah, hang on.] carries _(laughing)_ a lot of baggage! __[Bryn laughs]__ A physicist gets up at a podium and says, "Now, before you go a bit cross, I'm gonna use the phrase 'flat earth' in this speech. __[Ben chuckles]__ But, but!..."

#### BRYN

The thing is all the physicists in the room will shrug and say, "Sure, [__TIM:__ Sure.] spherical chickens in a vacuum."

#### TIM

Yeah. __[laughs]__ 'Kay. Fair enough. Alright.

#### BRYN

There are plenty of experiments you can do where it is impossible to achieve a perfect environment for it, and this is a really good example of one of them. You know, there are other ways to take out confounding factors. There's other ways to remove noise. For example, once the cosmic microwave background has been discovered and you know it's there, well, any future experiments you're like "well, we know it's there we just-- but we basically subtract it from all our numbers."

#### TIM

You go into Audacity, you select 'analyze noise profile', you select 'all universe' and hit 'filter' and then it's done.

#### BRYN

I'm actually gonna give you a point for that.

#### TIM

Yes! __[loud triumphant laugh]__

#### BRYN

Because it is almost exactly the same process. Yes.

##### [Ben laughs]

#### BEN

Alright, if we're just playing [Calvinball](https://calvinandhobbes.fandom.com/wiki/Calvinball), fine. __[Bryn and Tim laugh]__ I've lost all faith--

#### TIM

No, [Mornington Crescent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mornington_Crescent_(game)), Ben. We're playing Mornington Crescent and you know it!

#### BEN

Yeah. Actually, I should-- I am from the UK. I should say [__TIM:__ Come on.] Mornington Crescent not Calvinball.

#### BRYN

Okay.

#### TIM

_(simult.)_ Come on, you garbage trash boy. __[chuckles]__

#### BEN

_(simult.)_ I listen to too many American podcasts. Yeah.

#### BRYN

Okay. Okay. So, I think we've had enough setup now. We've talked about the scientific method and the foundation of science itself.

#### TIM

We're twenty minutes in. We've done the setup! Let's go!

#### BRYN

Obviously, here's a-- Yeah. That's me talking about *one* episode from this season.

##### [Tim laughs]

#### BEN

And we were worried that we wouldn't have enough content for an hour.

#### TIM

Tee hee.

#### BRYN

So, boys--

#### TIM

Lads.

#### BRYN

--in episode 28...

#### BEN

Yes.

#### BRYN

There's a certain... 30-second section during which I could *feel* you both looking at me __[Tim chuckles]__ with a very specific cheeky look in your eyes, which I have seen from both of you on several occasions.

##### [Ben and Tim gasp]

#### BEN

_(feigning surprise)_ A what?!

#### TIM

_(feigning surprise)_ Wh-what?! Us?! We?!

#### BEN

Pray tell.

##### [Tim laughs]

#### BRYN

You mentioned the substance--

#### TIM

Excuse me, let me put my monocle in so I can be shocked and drop it into a glass of water.

#### BRYN

You mentioned the substance "plutanium"--

#### BEN

Yes!

#### BRYN

I notice.

#### BEN

Yes.

#### BRYN

Not as it says in the show notes "platinum" but "plutanium". __[Tim wheezes]__ Plutanium is apparently a subject rarer and more dangerous than gold--

#### TIM

Yes.

#### BRYN

--which is my first minor wince. __[Tim chuckles]__ And you state specifically, and you repeat this sentence--

#### BEN

_(chuckling)_ Wait, sorry. No, hang on a minute.

#### BRYN

--a few times, while making--

#### BEN

I just wanna double back. I just wanna double back on you wincing at "rarer and more dangerous". I mean, the fact that it's fake makes it rarer, __[Tim laughs]__ and the fact that we've weaponised it against you probably makes it more danger-- 'cause as far as I know, gold is actually quite a safe element.

#### TIM

Pretty safe. Pretty safe. __[chuckles]__

#### BRYN

Yeah. Yeah. It's pretty-- Yeah. Why is it not just platinum which is rarer than gold? I mean, [__BEN:__ Because--] it's not more dangerous, 'cause neither of them are dangerous but--

#### BEN

Because I, as the person who introduced it, knew that if I said "platinum" or "plutonium", __[Tim and Bryn laugh]__ Bryn will be able to say, "Well boys, [__TIM:__ Well...] what are the actual properties?" so I said plutanium.

#### BRYN

Okay. Okay.

#### TIM

But we haven't even let you finish your question, Bryn. __[laughs]__

#### BEN

No.

#### BRYN

But the three-- The sentence that was repeated two or three times, which I could feel you both making direct eye-contact with while you said it through a podcast, which is an impressive feat--

#### TIM

It can be done.

#### BRYN

You said it was _(with contempt)_ "mined from inside a black... hole."

#### TIM

Yes, it was!

#### BEN

Oh, yeah.

#### TIM

Ha ha!

#### BEN

Yep, absolutely. One hundred percent.

#### BRYN

Boys...

#### BEN

That's how you do it.

#### BRYN

_(so much contempt)_ Mined. __[Tim chuckles]__ From inside.

#### BEN

Just because--

#### BRYN 

_(furious)_ A black. Hole.

#### BEN

Just because *your* limited understanding of astrophysics __[Bryn laughs]__ [__TIM:__ Mm. Mm. Mm.] cannot comprehend the possibility of [__TIM:__ Preach.] Stellar Firma's mining technology doesn't mean it doesn't exist, Bryn. Doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

#### TIM

You get an equally dense pickaxe. Is it hard to pick up? Yes, it is, but 'like with like'... finished sentence.

##### [Ben laughs]

#### BRYN

So, I'm subtracting a point from Tim there--

#### TIM

Oh no!

##### [Ben laughs loudly]

#### BRYN

--because we covered this last time! __[Tim laughs]__ Anything that is equally dense to a black hole is what, Tim?

#### TIM

Is al-- is also a black hole. __[laughs]__

#### BRYN

Is also a black hole.

#### TIM

_(slightly laughing)_ You pick up the pickaxe and your arm disappears into it. You're like, "Oh yeah, forgot. Hang on a minute, how have I got within thousands of-- thousands and thousands of miles of this dense pickaxe?"

#### BRYN

Yeah, I suppose, apparently in the far flung future where there is only Stellar Firma, [__TIM:__ Yep.] we have invented some form of technology that *allegedly* allows us to mine things from inside a black hole.

#### BEN

Nothing alleged about it. Stuff's built out of plutanium. [__TIM:__ Yeah.] They love it.

#### TIM

Yeah. Yeah. The proof of the pudding is in the fact that we've built things out of this fake thing we made up. __[chuckles]__

#### BEN

Yes.

#### BRYN

So, inside a black hole, what do we think there is?

#### TIM

Uh...

#### BEN

Hang on a minute! I think the answer is: we don't know.

#### TIM

Yes. Yes. I vote for Ben! We don't know, Bryn! How would you find out? The light can't get out of it.

#### BRYN

Interesting.

#### TIM

The light can't get out of it.

#### BRYN

Interesting.

#### TIM

So how would you look?

#### BRYN

Okay, Ben. Yeah, would you care to expand on that answer? Why don't we know?

#### BEN

'Cause you can't perceive inside a black hole 'cause nothing comes back to perceive, so how do you know?

#### BRYN

I will accept that. A point to Ben. We don't know what is inside a black hole, because nothing can get out of a black hole, which includes substances mined from inside it but also includes all information about what is even inside it. So, we do not *technically* know anything about the interior of a black hole. A black hole has something called the event horizon and it is-- that is the boundary through which nothing can pass in an outwards direction. But, our current understanding of black holes is that--

#### BEN

Oh, I've got a second answer. Sorry. Um, it's plutanium.

#### TIM

It's-- yes. Sorry. Ben has a point. It's plutanium. __[laughs]__

#### BRYN

Of course. Of course. Of course. Our current understanding of black holes indicate that the laws of physics actually continue to act normally within the bounds of the event horizon. There is no reason that they wouldn't.

#### BEN

_(slightly higher voice)_ But just really, really small.

#### TIM

_(mimicking Ben's slightly higher voice)_ Just a-- It's just a really, really small.

#### BRYN

Mostly what's inside a black hole is nothing, just like what's outside a black hole. A black hole is generally formed from a star and, therefore, a star is, you know, some stuff surrounded by mostly empty space. Inside a black hole it's the same. It's mostly empty space. What happens is-- is that all the mass in a black hole, as far as we understand, the laws of physics say that the mass will be concentrated to an infinitesimal point at the centre, and it is that point at the centre, which we call a singularity, where the laws of physics break down. But actually, if we consider the boundary of the black hole to be the event horizon, then *most* of the inside of the black hole is in fact nothing.

#### BEN

And if we consider the boundary to be the event horizon, are we agreeing with the scientific community, or are we making some stuff up?

#### BRYN

No. We are-- that is the-- that is what is generally accepted, [__BEN:__ Okay.] because that's the border through which nothing can pass in an outwards direction.

#### BEN

It's the point at which the hole becomes black.

#### BRYN

Essentially, yes. Yeah.

#### BEN

Sure.

#### BRYN

And you have-- you can have what's called Hawking radiation around the event horizon--

#### BEN

Oh, you get that nice little, like, double-loop thing, right?

#### BRYN

--which is a very slow release.

#### BEN

Or is that a different thing?

#### BRYN

Ish, yeah. I mean, that's more of a representation of-- but potentially, yeah. Yeah.

#### BEN

Yeah, so I didn't think you look into the sky and you'd see one of them __[Tim laughs]__ but I mean, like, [__BRYN:__ Yes.] seeing through a certain, like, lenses and stuff.

#### TIM

I found out something fun. I found out something fun. Let's ignore the questions we asked Bryn come here and ask us for a moment. __[laughs]__ I found out that atoms don't look anything like every atom I've ever seen drawn looks like.

#### BRYN

No, that's a complete lie.

#### TIM

They're all lies, [__BRYN:__ Yep.] because all of the electrons are basically everywhere in a big cloud of [potentialness](https://chemdictionary.org/orbitals/), [__BRYN:__ Yes. Absolutely.] and so it wouldn't look anything like _(getting louder)_ every atom I've ever been shown! Explain!

#### BRYN

Atoms are drawn like solar systems because apparently people who draw diagrams of atoms believe children are stupid.

#### TIM

I would have preferred a cloud of-- Look, here is a globe. The atom is everywhere and nowhere all at the same time-- Again, if you'd have told me that and that dude's crazy-ass name, I'd have been much more interested in science!

##### [Bryn laughs]

#### BEN

To be fair though, it would make it much more difficult to count the electrons when you were doing one of those puzzles about, like, we knock the electron out and which isotope<a id="footnote-5-ref" href="#footnote-5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> does it become so you can-- _(simult.)_ you have to count the actual to work it out.

#### TIM

_(simult., laughing)_ You just dissolve it into a cloud and go "best of luck!"

#### BEN

Yeah, exactly! You just flick one out of the cloud and like, pfft! Have a guess.

#### BRYN

This is actually an important point about science is, you know, we talked about science being a method of understanding truth, or not as the case may be.

#### BEN

It's an onion of lies.

#### BRYN

And a lot of science is lies, because what science really is is a *model* of the universe, of reality. It's not, you know, it's not necessarily a perfect understanding and especially when quantum physics was being developed where we discovered stuff like an electron is actually a cloud of possibilities. We discovered that the universe is much weirder and harder to understand than we could possibly have imagined before and--

#### TIM

And so we stopped trying.

##### [Ben snorts]

#### BRYN

Basically... yes. What we have to accept is that our understanding of the universe is what we call a model, and the model is only useful as long as it makes predictions. But the model can also be useful even when it doesn't necessarily reflect reality. And so chemists, to understand chemical reactions and to understand things like isotopes or chemical bonding between elements, their model of the atom doesn't need to care about the fact that electrons aren't lil' balls of stuff orbiting around the centre of the atom.

#### TIM

Okay. Alright.

#### BRYN

Their model allows them to make accurate predictions about the real world based on something that is not *technically* true, but we talked about the scientific method--hypothesis, test, conclusion. If their hypothesis is a model that in certain circumstances we can say an atom works like this and it makes correct conclusions, then it doesn't matter that the real picture is more complicated. And we do this all the time in physics as well. So, you probably both studied... you know, back in school, stuff like the laws of motion, and you probably had to calculate, you know, cars moving around or billiard balls or things on slopes and--

#### TIM

I was asked to. I can't claim that I ever did, but I was certainly asked to, Bryn.

#### BEN

Probably. And at some point, I was asked about Boyle's law<a id="footnote-6-ref" href="#footnote-6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> and shown a spring and I was like, "Ah, I ain't got __[mumbling]__ any clue. I don't know."

##### [Tim laughs]

#### BRYN

Sure. But, in all these examples, we ignore air resistance, unless you're studying, you know-- and depending on what age you're studying these things, you may or may not ignore friction. But we know these things from our everyday experience exist, and we know that if we wanted to get super accurate results we'd have to include air resistance and friction, but actually the results that we get by ignoring them are close enough that if we don't need to be a hundred percent accurate, if we're just trying to make a decent prediction, the prediction is good enough most of the time.

#### TIM

It's spherical chickens again.

#### BRYN

Spherical chickens in a vacuum. Absolutely. And it is-- it's an important joke in a way, because what it says is, well, reality is complex and messy, as we've already established, and science helps us understand it, but if science is making accurate predictions, that's really what's important, and accurate predictions are, you know, essentially specific to a certain field or a certain test. You know, if I say-- well, if I chuck this acid and this alkali into a cup together, I don't need to know what's gonna happen with every single atom inside. What I need to know is what's gonna end up in the cup at the end.

#### TIM

There's potentially a lovely analogy, I think from-- I think it's from cartography, where they say the only true map is the exact size and shape of the thing you are trying to map, [__BRYN:__ Absolutely.] but best of luck taking that on a short camper-vanning holiday in the Cotswolds. __[Bryn laughs]__ So... we use the Ordnance Survey and we like it.

#### BRYN

Perfect. Perfect. Another thing that annoyed me--we're gonna jump here--we've talked about episode 26 and episode 28, and, as I said, there was very little science in this season, so there were way fewer things that annoyed me. In episode 40, Hartro tries to kill you both. Her first attempt to kill you both was by doing what?

#### TIM

Fill the room with acid, I think?

#### BEN

No, it was lava.

#### TIM

Oh, it was lav--

#### BEN

_(crosstalk)_ Oh, it was hot slurry! It was hot slurry!

#### TIM

Hot slurry! It was hot slurry masquerading as lava.

#### BEN

Yes.

#### BRYN

It was hot slurry masquerading as lava. Exactly.

#### TIM

Well, though we don't necessarily know that slurry isn't partially made out of hot stones. Just saying. But go on. __[chuckles]__

#### BRYN

So, in the episode, we definitely described it as being similar enough to lava.

#### TIM

Mm.

#### BRYN

But I think we can--

#### BEN

Wait, hang on a minute! Hang on a minute. Is this-- No, hang on. I'm gonna preempt you. __[Tim laughs]__ Is this because it's technically magma?

#### BRYN

No! No no no no no.

#### BEN

Oh! Okay.

#### TIM

'Cause it's inside Stellar Firma! __[laughs]__

#### BRYN

I'm not quibbling about terminology here.

##### [Ben laughs]

#### TIM

Where's our caldera, Bryn? Where's our caldera?

#### BEN

Wait, hang on a minute! Also, Bryn, you're a physicist and you're not quibbling about terminology? I don't think you're a real physicist.

##### [Tim and Bryn laugh]

#### TIM

You're a botanist in a lab coat!

#### BEN

Aw, they're even worse!

##### [Tim laughs]

#### BRYN

If we take a room and we fill, say, the bottom ten centimetres--

#### TIM

Yes.

#### BRYN

--with lava--

#### TIM

Sure.

#### BEN

Mm.

#### BRYN

--or a substance that is the equivalent heat of lava--

#### TIM

Analogous. Yep.

#### BEN

Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

#### BRYN

--how easy do we think it might be to survive in that room?

#### TIM

I'm-- __[laughs]__

#### BEN

Am I a clone?

#### BRYN

Sure.

#### TIM

I'm not though.

#### BEN

Cool. In which case, yeah, it's fine.

#### TIM

It's fine because--

#### BEN

Explain to me a clone's biology. Right back at you, Bryn.

#### TIM

Okay, but let's say-- Trexel is a human, and I'm also in that room. __[chuckles]__

#### BRYN

I don't--

#### BEN

Ah, remember, we are so very loose with the definition of human.

##### [Tim laughs]

#### BRYN

I don't believe... I don't believe your biology makes a difference here.

#### TIM

Is it going to mean--

#### BEN

Uh, uh-- Well, hang on a minute. Hang on a minute. __[Tim chuckles]__ I could get super strong without having any possible physical changes so... I mean, explain that one, physicist!

#### TIM

So, okay. Can I maybe say that perhaps, perhaps--

#### BEN

Alright, yes. I'll answer the question in good faith, I suppose.

##### [Bryn laughs]

#### TIM

__[laughs]__ --the air in the room is going to get quite hot.

#### BRYN

I'm gonna give a point to Tim.

#### TIM

Yeah!

#### BRYN

Partly because it's the right answer, and--

#### TIM

Is it [pyroclastic flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyroclastic_flow)? __[laughs]__

#### BRYN

--partly because Ben sassed me. __[laughs]__

#### BEN

That's fine. I gave myself a million-billion points just then, so I'm all good.

##### [Bryn and Tim laugh]

#### TIM

Listeners, you can't see this, but he's actually just holding armfuls of points and __[Bryn laughs]__ nuzzling his face into them, laughing! Like an only-from-the-waist-up Scrooge McDuck.

##### [Ben laughs]

#### BRYN

So, yeah. So, in the episode, David seems to be okay as long as he's not touching the lava. [__TIM:__ Yes.] And this is a common misunderstanding in places, you know--

#### TIM

From 'the floor is lava' of our childhood. __[chuckles]__

#### BRYN

For example, in everyday childhood games [__TIM:__ Yeah.] and also in Hollywood and movies. You know.

#### BEN

Do you mean *Indiana Jones* lied to me?

#### BRYN

Yes. __[Ben gasps]__ I'm afraid so. There are three ways by which heat travels. Do we know what they are?

#### BEN

Uh, uh, wait. Convection.

#### BRYN

Yep.

#### BEN

Radiation.

#### BRYN

Yep.

#### TIM

And Uber.

#### BEN

And a third one I don't know.

#### TIM

Convection, radiation and... Ooh.

#### BEN

I'm gonna say emanation, which I think is just radiation and I got my thesaurus out, but it's a-- it's a big word.

##### [Bryn laughs]

#### TIM

Convection, radiation-- Ugh! I feel like I know it, but I can't give you an answer, which normally means I don't know it. __[Ben chuckles]__ Bryn, what's the answer? __[chuckles]__

#### BRYN

The third one is conduction.

#### BEN

Aah, yes! Obviously.

#### TIM

Aah.

#### BRYN

Conduction, convection, radiation. And--

#### BEN

Con-- I'm an idiot. I forgot, like, what happens when a fork gets hot. __[laughs]__

#### BRYN

Basically-- and basically this is how heat travels through a solid substance or another-- a substance of similar density to a solid, a fluid substance, i.e., a liquid or a gas, and through a vacuum.

#### TIM

Conduction is solid, convection is liquid, radiation is gas.

#### BEN

No.

#### BRYN

No, no, no.

#### TIM

No. No.

#### BEN

Convection is liquid and gas __[Tim sighs]__ [__BRYN:__ Yes.] and radiation is-- which is why you have radiation in space.

#### BRYN

It's through a vacuum. Yes.

#### TIM

Aaah.

#### BEN

So the sun radiates because it has to go through space.

#### TIM

No, I believe that there's gas in between us and the sun, and that's how the heat gets here.

#### BRYN

I'm afraid that theory-- that scientific theory was disproved [__TIM:__ What?!] in the early 20th Century.

#### BEN

Uh, funny enough--

#### TIM

_(crosstalk, urgently)_ Hang on a minute! What about the plum pudding? Please tell me that the plum pudding still stands!

##### [Bryn laughs]

#### BEN

But funnily enough, actually, that theory was *reproved* in, uh, 2050-- 2055 so...

#### TIM

Yep. Sorry. __[Bryn laughs]__ Turns out there's secret black matter gas! __[laughs]__

#### BEN

Yep.

#### BRYN

Yep. Yep. Yep.

#### BEN

That's where all the dark matter went!

#### TIM

Wouldn't it be great--

#### BEN

They built a pipe from the sun to earth!

#### TIM

--if they were like, "Sorry, guys. There's no such thing as a vacuum. It's actually just dark matter, and we got confused. Whoopsie!" [__BEN: [laughs]__ You know why--] Not impossible.

#### BEN

"You know how we couldn't see it? Well..."

#### TIM

Well. __[laughs]__

#### BEN

"We couldn't see the wood for the trees, it turns out." __[chuckles]__

#### BRYN

I mean, we don't know what dark matter is. And if in fact the properties of dark matter were consistent with that hypothesis, you could go about testing it. Yeah. So, all three methods of heat transfer are happening all the time, but it's about which one happens best. But essentially, the laws of thermodynamics tell us that heat always moves from a hotter to a colder body. My favourite formulation of the laws of thermodynamics is you can't win, you can't break even, and you can't get out of the game.

#### BEN

Aah, nice. That's a good simplification.

#### TIM

I! Didn't! Understand that! _(laughing)_ Somebody explain it to me!

#### BRYN

So thermodynamics is fundamentally about how energy moves around.

#### TIM

Yeah.

#### BRYN

And basically, the three laws of thermodynamics boil down to 'you can't create energy out of nothing'--

#### TIM

You can't win.

#### BRYN

--'you can't transfer energy with a hundred percent efficiency', you'll always waste somewhere else. Basically, you can't transfer energy from one form to another with a hundred percent efficiency. You'll always create [__TIM:__ Something. Yeah.] a third-- a little bit of loss into a third form of energy.

#### TIM

Noise, heat, whatever.

#### BRYN

Exactly. And 'you can't get out of the game' is you can't destroy energy either, but also you can't-- I forget exactly how you phrase that one. But a lot of thermodynamic laws are about closed systems and stuff, so it's like you can't break these laws by expanding your system, essentially.

#### BEN

Also sorry, very quickly circling back, with the convection, radiation, and conduction thing, does that mean a radiator is actually a convectionator?

#### BRYN

Sort of, yes.

#### TIM

Wow. Hang on. Sorry--

#### BEN

'Cause unless I've sucked all the air out of my room-- __[chuckles]__

#### TIM

My room is now full of scales, because they've all fallen from my eyes. Sorry, let me just shift these away.

##### [Ben and Bryn laugh]

#### BRYN

Well, as I said, all three forms of heat transfer are happening at any given time from a hot object. If a hot object is near a cold object, or surrounded by cold air for example, then on the very surface conduction happens--you know, the hot object conducts heat into the cold air. Radiation is being given off-- heat radiation is being given off by the hot object and being absorbed by the cold object, but certainly in a fluid substance the main transfer of heat is through convection, which is where the little bit of the air next to the hot object has gotten hot first and has started to move around the room.

#### TIM

So we'd have been pyroclastic-flowed to death pretty quickly from superheated gas.

#### BRYN

Well, essentially, yes. If the slurry-- the hot slurry introduced to the room was in fact the temperature of lava, it would not take very long at all for that heat to be spread to all the air in the room.

#### BEN

I can't remember if we explicitly gave a reference to how hot it was. Like, it was definitely hot enough to kill you, [__TIM:__ Sure.] but boiling water would do that, like, would do a big number on you. [__BRYN:__ Yeah.] But I can't remember if we had the thing where like-- and it might've only been soundscaped but like, you know, the bed legs catch fire as they touch them and stuff like that. __[Tim chuckles]__ 'Cause obviously with boiling water, it would just be submerged, and all the [__BRYN:__ Yes.] objects would be sad but wouldn't be on fire.

#### TIM

It'd cook. You'd get sort of a soggy, wobbly table. Like pasta.

#### BEN

Yeah.

#### BRYN

I'm very much using a little scientific licence here, because--

#### BEN

Oh no no no. We were a hundred percent being, like, [__TIM:__ Yeah. It's lava.] it's lava. But--

#### TIM

So, I seem to remember-- maybe this is because it's being insulated by rock, but I seem to remember people standing next to lava flows and being like, "this right here is lava" and poking it with a stick, because, like, the rock is cooled, so it's still lava, but the rock that's cooled down is insulating the inside which is still lava.

#### BRYN

So, one of the key facts there is also the environment in which this is taking place. [__BEN:__ The outside.] __[Tim and Ben chuckle]__ So if you've got a small stream of lava flowing down a mountain--

#### TIM

Lots of room and lots of air. Yeah.

#### BRYN

--you've got lots of room, you don't have that much lava. But-- And the hot air, you know, the air heats up and very quickly moves away from the lava, but, you know, it's not being contained in one place and so the hot air quickly leaves.

#### TIM

Alright. Bucket of lava in a walk-in wardrobe. Do I survive?

#### BRYN

Probably not.

#### TIM

Really? Just a bucket.

#### BRYN

Probably not. Yes, I think-- Now, you can do specific calculations about how much heat there is in the lava, and how much heat will be transferred to the air and how quickly that will be. But essentially, if something is in fact several hundred degrees, if it's hot enough to be considered lava, then it's going to heat the air around it very quickly. And we've definitely established in the past that the room that Trexel and David live in is a pretty closed environment.

#### BEN

That Davidlives in and Trexel visits sometimes.

#### BRYN

That's the-- that's the one. Yes.

#### BEN

Also, I wanna circle back to what kind of bucket are you holding, Tim, that just is full of lava? We're not playing minecraft. __[chuckles]__

#### TIM

One of the ones from a foundry that has liquid iron ore in it. One of the big stone ones. I think they're stone? I think they're stone.

#### BEN

Fair enough. Are they buckets?

#### TIM

Yes! They've literally got a giant swingy handle!

#### BEN

Yeah, but at that point are they called, like, cauldrons or something?

#### TIM

Gah, that's just a fancy bucket with ideas above its station. __[Ben snorts]__

#### BEN

I like that idea of, like, __[Bryn laughs]__ a really-- a witch with no airs just uses a bucket [__TIM:__ Just a bucket!] instead of a cauldron.

#### TIM

"Ah, don't do that stuff. Anyway, 'ubble bubble, boil n' trouble. Get in the bucket!" __[Ben laughs]__ "When shall we three meet again?" "I don't know! Text me." And walks out.

#### BEN

Yeah.

#### BRYN

Yes. So I'm afraid in the game 'the floor is lava' you die very quickly whether or not you touch the lava because the air around you becomes super-heated. And I'm pretty sure that was the fate of David 7 in that episode. But I'm going to give the point to Ben for that question, because he got two out of three versions of heat and he was very good at finding potential loopholes __[Tim and Ben laugh]__ to divert me from my [incomprehensible due to the laughter] and I think that deserves a point.

#### TIM

Yeah. For tricksy-ness, if nothing else.

#### BEN

Got those big strong clone lungs.

##### [Tim laughs]

#### BRYN

Yeah. So, part of the point for knowledge and part of the point for nerd pedantry, both of which I appreciate.

#### BEN

Love it.

#### BRYN

In episode 34, we have a client looking to buy a planet who is a Mantis Shrimp.

#### BEN

Yes.

#### TIM

Stefan.

#### BRYN

And the Mantis Shrimp can apparently see the hidden colours, [__BEN:__ Yes.] and all the wavelengths of light which David and Trexel are not privy to.

#### TIM

Yes!

#### BEN

Yes, and we're very jealous.

#### BRYN

Yeah, a big point is the jealousy and the desire to conquer the same worlds as the Mantis Shrimp.

#### BEN

Do you know how hard it was during that episode not to say [octarine](https://discworld.fandom.com/wiki/Octarine)? __[Bryn laughs]__ [__TIM:__ Oh. Oh!] It was so difficult not to say octarine.

#### BRYN

I assumed as much.

#### TIM

We were all sitting on chests with many legs.

#### BRYN

So what do we know about light? We mentioned the concept of wavelengths of light. Do we know what the wavelength of light is? And in terms of seeing hidden colours, there's a very good, you know, scientific principle on which that could be based. And in fact, several non-human creatures [__TIM:__ Mm!] do in fact see what we could think of as hidden colours, because they are able to see things that we cannot.

#### TIM

I believe this is a rare example of where Tim and Ben knew some real-life facts about the mantis shrimp because--

#### BRYN

I believe this is true, yeah.

#### TIM

Because obviously what we consider 'visible light' is very much 'visible to humans' so the visible spectrum is very much from a human standpoint. So I believe that mantis shrimps can see, like, up into ultraviolet and down into-- I don't know.

#### BEN

Infrared.

#### TIM

Infrared. And things like that. So their visible spectrum is much broader than ours. So there are potentially what we would, if we could see them, class as different colours, if only we had the eyes.

#### BEN

Well, I think that's the problem as well. We can't tell, because we can't perceive as a mantis shrimp, and any way that we do [__BRYN:__ Absolutely.] perceive infrared and ultraviolet is being interpreted into a [__TIM:__ Computer or yeah.] human visible spectrum, so we don't know what it looks like. We *can't* know what it looks like.

#### TIM

Also, a question. Is there any-- is it sort of a bit of a tree-falling-in-the-forest question of everything that we consider a colour is our brain's interpretation of a wavelength. [__BRYN:__ Yes.] So that there isn't any independent-- there's no independent colour of processing of our brain.

#### BEN

That's how you get colour-blindness.

#### TIM

Yes, that is a very good point.Yes, that's a very good point.

#### BEN

Red isn't red, it's just what we agree as red. Broadly.

#### TIM

This is a 'university, we've been drinking, it's 3 AM' argument: "What I call red, man, is that what you call red, dude?"

#### BEN

Well, no. But again, like, for physics, it's a model.

#### TIM

Yes.

#### BRYN

Absolutely.

#### BEN

We have a model of red, and we apply the model to the world, that means we can all understand, unless you have colour-blindness and then it becomes a problem.

#### BRYN

Yes.

#### TIM

It's very irritating. And you have to have special settings on your computer.

#### BRYN

I mean, there's certainly a philosophical question about colour there, which I choose not to address because it is very much a 'well, what is meaning, __[Tim breaths in deeply, sighs dramatically]__ what is knowledge, what is truth.'

#### BEN

Well, experience is perception, right?

#### TIM

Yeah.

#### BRYN

We are able to divide the visible spectrum into certain wavelengths, and we know that different people will identify those different sets of wavelengths within the visible spectrum as the same colour. In that sense, colour is a scientifically-replicable experience--

#### TIM and BEN

Yeah.

#### BRYN

--because different people call it the same thing. Now, when we say spectrum, we've talked about visible light, we've talked about ultraviolet and infrared, what is the spectrum we're talking about?

#### BEN

Do you want us to give numbers of frequencies? Because I've-- No way. __[Bryn laughs]__ Absolutely not.

#### TIM 

_(confidently)_ Uh, six to a hundred!

#### BEN

Oh my god.Okay, I know that's wrong.

##### [Tim chuckles]

#### TIM

Like, fifteen million--

#### BRYN

I don't mean what the numbers are, [__TIM:__ Four!] I'll happily share the numbers. I mean what is the spectrum as a whole? What else is on it, and what is it called?

#### TIM

It's the electromagnetic spectrum.

#### BRYN

It *is* the electromagnetic spectrum.

#### BEN

Oh.

#### TIM

And we have got X-rays, gamma rays, uhh--

#### BRYN

Yep.

#### TIM

Uhh-- __[chuckles]__ *Ben!* Uhh--

#### BEN

Microwaves.

#### TIM

Microwaves!

#### BRYN

Yeah.

#### TIM

Thank you! Radio waves.

#### BEN

Radio waves.

#### BRYN

Yep.

#### TIM

Which are very long and slow, and that's why they get everywhere and can go into space.

#### BRYN

I'm going to give you one point each there. [__TIM:__ Oof!] You both named several parts of the electromagnetic spectrum and you've in fact named them all. In order it is radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, gamma rays.

#### TIM

So the micro in microwaves, is that to do with, like, wave height? Because th-- Like, if radios are the long, slow ones and then micro is the second biggest after radio, why is it micro?

#### BRYN

That is a really good question. And I think you're going to enjoy this answer actually.

#### TIM

Hang on, let me just pick up my drink _(voice sounds more distant as he presumably leans back)_ and lean back in my chair. *Do tell*.

##### [Ben chuckles]

#### BRYN

It is not the height of the waves. Waves have certain properties. One of the properties of a wave is its height, and we describe that as the amplitude of the wave. And the amplitude of any section of the electromagnetic spectrum could be tiny or could be huge. They are literally waves, and the thing that is waving is an electromagnetic field. So you can, in fact, detect it as tiny changes in electricity and magnetism passing through a point. The other property, the one we've already been discussing, is the wavelength. Do you know what the wavelength of a wave is?

#### TIM

It is the distance between the peak of a wave and then the next peak of the wave. So it's-- it's, yeah, those two points and the distance between them.

#### BRYN

Yeah. I'm going to give you a point for that. I like that. __[Tim starts clapping]__ Very clear, very concise, and very correct.

#### TIM

I got points! Yay!

#### BRYN

Yeah, so the wavelength is what matters. And the reason microwaves are called microwaves is because their wavelengths are measured in micrometres because we are in the SI system of units. So we know what a metre is... I would hope.

#### TIM

Yes. __[chuckles]__

#### BEN

Broadly, yeah.

#### BRYN

It's a measure of distance. Yeah.

#### TIM

I can't believe that you waited for us to confirm. "No, I don't know what a metre is. I only work in feet and yards!"

#### BRYN

I just-- I worry when the audio is only me talking for too long.

##### [Tim and Ben laugh]

#### BEN

On this show, it's a blessing and a rarity.

#### BRYN

A problem I know you don't share Tim.

##### [Ben and Bryn laugh]

#### TIM

I just keep going. Blah bl-blah blah blah blah!

#### BRYN

Now, the SI system of units says that we have prefixes we can append to metres to indicate a different amount, and there's a system, and the one you're probably most familiar with is kilometres.

#### BEN

Well, actually, I'm most familiar with a metre.

#### BRYN

Yeah.

#### BEN

To be honest.

##### [Tim and Ben laugh]

#### BRYN

But, again, so kilometres is every-- one kilometre is a thousand metres, and you've probably also heard of centimetres and millimetres--

#### TIM

Yeah.

#### BEN

No.

#### BRYN

--which are a hundredth of a metre and a thousandth of a metre, and I'm saying very basic things here. I'm sure that's not a surprise. But the system extends in both directions, and, in fact, you again would be familiar with some of the larger parts of the system, mostly from computers.

#### TIM

Yes.

#### BRYN

So, after kilometres you technically--and we don't use them--but you technically have megametres--

#### BEN

_(loudly)_ Megametres!

##### [Tim laughs]

#### BRYN

You have megametres, gigametres, and--

#### BRYN and BEN

_(simult.)_ Terametres.

#### TIM

And petametres, and...

#### BRYN

Eventually.

#### TIM

Ugh.

#### BRYN

Exactly. Now, on the other side, under millimetres you have micrometres. So, a micrometre is one one-millionth of a metre. And then a term you've probably heard before is nanometres, which is one one-billionth of a metre.

#### TIM

The intervals with which they move are so irritatingly inconsistent. Like, 'cause they're all-- I'm sure they have a consistency but they're all, like, exponential [__BRYN:__ Yes.] in a way that I find deeply irritating, because you're like "Oh, sorry, this is one down, and by one down I mean a *hundred-thousand* down".

#### BRYN

So, it's actually every-- every increment for the-- except centimetres, which doesn't fit the pattern and is therefore, bad and wrong. We shouldn't really use. __[Tim gasps]__ But, everything else--

#### BEN 

_(sarcastic)_ Oh, yes. Sorry for being the most human understandable measurement.

##### [Tim laughs loudly]

#### BRYN

Everything else in this--

#### TIM

Scientists won't allow it! __[laughs]__

#### BEN

Yeah.

#### BRYN

Everything else in the system is three zeros. One step of the, in terms of the prefixes we use, is add three zeros or take away three zeros, essentially.

#### TIM

Right. Right.

#### BRYN

So, that's the consistent step. Yeah, because if you have to measure both very tiny things and very big things, you just can't do it in any other way. You've gotta do it on a system which respects orders of magnitude, factors of ten.

#### TIM

It'd take too long.

#### BRYN

Yeah. Visible light is, if I remember correctly-- I really should have looked this up before the show, I believe it's from 340 nm to 790 nm, the wavelength of visible light.<a id="footnote-7-ref" href="#footnote-7"><sup>[7]</sup></a>

#### BEN

Let him know in the comments. Please @ him.

#### BRYN

Yep.

#### TIM

Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep.

#### BEN

He's, I think, @BraveSirRobin on Twitter. __[Tim laughs]__ Just let him know.

#### BRYN

Uh, [BraveSirFblthp](https://twitter.com/BraveSirFblthp) is it.

#### TIM

Oh!

#### BEN

Oh! BraveSirFblthip.

#### TIM

Length and frighteningness of message encouraged.

##### [Bryn laughs]

#### BEN

Yeah. __[chuckles]__

#### BRYN

Yeah. So, microwaves are called microwaves because their wavelengths are measured in micrometres.

#### TIM

But what a weird thing to do, like, hey, we've got these measurements. We're gonna name one of them about __[Bryn laughs]__ the measure with which we use to measure them and the other one's not because-- Did they just get discovered at very different times by different people [__BRYN:__ Yeah!] and just no one can agree?

#### BRYN

Most of these phenomena were indeed discovered at different times by different people, and it took a long time for everyone to realise they were essentially all the same thing.

#### TIM

Oh, so they've all got different backgrounds and conventions, and then it's like, [__BRYN:__ Exactly.] "Aah, we've been calling this for so long now! It'd be really awkward to change all the books!"

#### BEN

They had to have a big counsel, right?

#### BRYN

Yeah.

#### BEN

'Cause that's what the SI scale is. Everyone met up and went, "Right. [__BRYN:__ Yep.] We're just gonna work this out 'cause this is silly". And then America went, "No, screw you. We're doing our own thing".

#### BRYN

I mean, Britain did for a long time too, but Britain eventually changed their minds.

#### BEN

Yeah, that's because we're America-lite.

##### [Bryn chuckles]

#### TIM

America did a very fun thing in paleontology where we all *eventually*, *eventually*--mm, still here and there--agreed on certain ages of the world. And then America said, "That's great; we've got our own and none of them match up. Anyway, goodbye." And it has messed with paleontology and geology ever since!

#### BEN

Nice. Also, I have another thing which is--first of all I wanna check but then also if I'm right I wanna show off to Bryn-senpai __[Tim laughs]__--which is, I think I know what the smallest unit of measurement is.

#### BRYN

Yeah?

#### BEN

And that is a Planck length, and is that...?

#### BRYN

_(impressed)_ Yeah.

#### BEN

Yeah!

#### BRYN

Yeah.

#### BEN

Nailed it!

#### BRYN

I'll give you a point for that. That is--

#### BEN

Yes! Ha ha!

#### BRYN

A Planck length is *way* smaller than any of the ones we've discussed. So, under nanometres there's-- God, there's something like femtometres and attometres,<a id="footnote-8-ref" href="#footnote-8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> and, when you get to this kind of scale of things, everything's expressed in powers of ten, so nanometres is ten to the minus nine (10<sup>-9</sup>). A Planck length is something like ten to the minus thirty-four (10<sup>-34</sup>) metres,<a id="footnote-9-ref" href="#footnote-9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> so that's 0.000-- where you've got thirty-three zeros and then a one.

#### BEN

It got developed to try and, like, measure... sort of like neutrons or something absurd, wasn't it?

#### BRYN

No, way smaller than that. I mean--

#### BEN

Oh, right. Okay.

#### BRYN

Femtometres and attometres measure atoms and nuclei, respectively.

#### BEN

Oh, are we getting onto quarks then?

#### BRYN

Well, if you're talking about Planck length, you're talking way smaller than that even.

#### BEN

Oh, wow! Okay.

#### BRYN

It's, like-- a Planck length is like the fundamental smallest possible distance in the universe [__BEN:__ Ahh.] essentially.

#### TIM

Is it a theoretical one? Is it sort of like, mm, maybe this is a thing but it's not a thing we can really look at?

#### BRYN

Well, you're asking the big questions.

#### TIM

Oh, yes. What is god? Bryn, discuss. __[laughs]__

#### BEN

Uh, god is a Higgs boson, and we've found him. Just hangin' about. __[chuckles]__

#### BRYN

_(groaning)_ Oh god. Don't-- do not refer-- do not refer to the Higgs boson as the God particle in front of me.

#### TIM

Yeah yeah yeah yeah.

#### BRYN

I make an angry face!

#### BEN

I don't know why they ever got that. __[Tim sighs]__ Like, what were we gonna achieve with the Higgs boson [__TIM:__ Yeah.] that's like, oh my god!

#### TIM

Especially given that it was like, well we're pretty sure it exists but we're gonna prove it. Like, well then, like, not much has chang-- I get it's important, but it's not like we're gonna, like, do a test and then a *door* is gonna open and then a bearded face is gonna poke out [__BRYN:__ Yeah.] and go "congratulations, you won!"

#### BRYN

Not exactly.

#### BEN

Maybe they thought it was!

#### TIM

Oh, true.

#### BEN

Maybe everyone at CERN was like I really hope a door opens.

#### BRYN

No. No.

#### TIM

But anyway, Bryn, what we can be certain of is there's _(sarcastic panic)_ a chance it'll make a black hole! Oh no! __[chuckles]__ We should all be worried!

#### BEN

In Switzerland!

#### BRYN

No. No.

#### TIM

__[laughs]__ The looks. The looks, people.

#### BEN

Zurich. Zurich is a singularity now!

##### [Tim laughs]

#### BRYN

So, you may have heard of something called the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.

#### TIM

Yes.

#### BEN

I have and have no idea what it is.

#### BRYN

Essentially, the properties of elements of the universe--and by elements, I mean mostly subatomic particles--are not as well defined as we think. A bit like Tim discussed earlier where an electron is not really a lil' solid lump of thing, but it's more of a cloud of possibilities. Well it turns out everything is like that, and the amount of possibility, even, varies a lil' bit. And, you know, that's called uncertainty. And basically, what Heisenberg's uncertainty principle says is, yeah, it is absolutely impossible to know certain properties of subatomic particles exactly, because they fundamentally don't *have* these properties. [__TIM:__ Yeah.] The properties are mixed in with a whole bunch of other properties and the whole thing is a lil' ball of possibilities.

#### BEN

Hmm.

#### BRYN

And the Planck length describes the smallest possible distance you could ever measure because, if you get smaller than the Planck length, distance ceases to have meaning, because it is absolutely physically impossible, by the laws of the universe as we understand them, for something to exist at all smaller than that, because anything that exists must be at least uncertain enough to be bigger than that.

#### BEN

Aah.

#### TIM

Is it-- Yeah, so is that to do with where there's a-- again, this is Tim Meredith half remembering a fact from a science book, but there's a thing where you can either, like, view where it is or where it's going but not both. There's a whole thing [__BRYN:__ Yes.] where the act of looking at it messes with things so much that you can know one-half of it or the other half of it but never both.

#### BRYN

Absolutely. And that was the first demonstrable effect of the uncertainty principle, and the uncertainty principle has become broader than that over time as our understanding of quantum physics has increased, but the first observe, and in fact where it was coined, was about exactly that situation you're describing where it turns out we cannot measure both the *position* and *movement* of an individual particle because if we measure one, the other changes, and they're related by a certain amount of uncertainty.

#### TIM

Right.

#### BRYN

But it turns out that, fundamentally, there is some level at which the particle doesn't *have* those properties. It has a *combination* of those two properties *together* and, therefore, to measure one or the other is essentially meaningless in some sense, because all we can say is these two properties are related.

#### TIM

And so that's where Elvis and Lord Lucan are hiding, correct?

#### BRYN

Presumably so.

##### [Ben snorts, then laughs]

#### TIM

Okay. Right.

#### BRYN

One can only assume. That's a good hypothesis. Devise scientific tests that test that hypothesis and get back to me.

#### TIM

__[laughs]__ I've found the Elvis particle!

##### [Ben laughs]

#### BRYN

Uh, yeah. So, we've gone pretty deep there, and it takes a long time to explain the uncertainty principle well and the exact nature of uncertainty. But I'm definitely giving Tim a point for knowing about the position/momentum [__TIM:__ Yes!] uncertainty relationship.

#### TIM

I'm telling you, this Bill Bryson book is paying dividends. __[Bryn and Ben laugh]__ I'm so glad I started with that one and not *Notes from a Small Island*.

##### [Ben laughs]

#### BRYN

So what you said is you've done homework since last time we did this episode. __[laughs]__

#### TIM

I've done-- I've done *pre*-homework. __[laughs]__

#### BRYN

Yeah, so, in fact, in theory, the entire electromagnetic spectrum could potentially be visible to different creatures--

#### BEN

_(chuckling)_ Oh, yes. We were talking about mantis shrimps.

#### TIM

_(laughing)_ Oh yeah! Twenty minutes ago. __[laughs]__

#### BRYN

But, one of the key features is any *receiver* of an electromagnetic signal works best when it is approximately the *same size* as the wavelength of the thing it's receiving. [__BEN:__ Ah.] So in fact, the bits in our eye which pick up visible light are about the same size as the wavelength of visible light, and therefore, it's very easy to think of creatures which have slightly bigger or slightly smaller, and therefore, can pick up... things the size of that. But it would-- It's almost impossible to imagine a creature which can *see* radio waves, 'cause the wavelength of radio waves is several meters, and that would have to mean that the constituent parts of their eye that detected radio waves [__TIM:__ Yeah.] would have to be that large. So you'd have to be talking about some sort of theoretical giant space whale that could see radio waves.

#### BEN

Oh, they're Star Marlins.

#### TIM

If *only* we had... Space Whales and Star Marlins.

#### BRYN

Absolutely.

#### TIM

If only.

#### BRYN

And it's all but-- therefore, for a similar reason, almost impossible to imagine a creature that could see X-rays, because it would have to be so small that there just wouldn't be enough atoms to make up a creature that could detect X-rays.

#### TIM

Yes. You haven't got enough atoms to have eyes. [__BRYN:__ Basically.] __[laughs]__ Which feels like something-- like it should be some sort of weird, I don't know, title for a biography. "Not Enough Atoms for Eyes: 5 Years as an... Amoeba." I don't know. __[chuckles]__

#### BEN

Well, I think "Atoms for Eyes" is a Thom Yorke solo project,<a id="footnote-10-ref" href="#footnote-10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> right?

__[Bryn laughs]__

#### TIM

Ey! Ey! C'mon!

#### BEN

Wow, that was niche.

#### TIM

This ain't no "Them Crooked Vultures". __[Ben laughs]__ Which I think is another supergroup of some kind. __[laughs]__

#### BRYN

It is indeed.

#### BEN

I like the idea that we're talking about supergroups and that one-- that supergroup was just Thom Yorke on his own. __[laughs]__

#### TIM

Yeah yeah yeah yeah. Sorry, yes.

##### [Ben laughs]

#### BRYN

There was one other thing that was touched on this year in Stellar Firma which I want to mention, and it was again-- it was almost a throwaway line. But, it's a topic--

#### TIM

Most things are! _(laughing)_ It's a show *entirely* consisted of throwaway lines. __[laughs]__

#### BRYN

It's a topic *I* enjoy, and I think that it will appeal to Stellar Firma fans, which is in episode 31, you mentioned the concept of a Dyson sphere--

#### BEN

We did.

#### TIM

Yes.

#### BRYN

--which is a favourite of science fiction fans around the world and, given that Stellar Firma is science fiction, hopefully, therefore, something of interest to our audience.

#### BEN

And a completely irrelevant thing!

#### BRYN

In a sense, yeah.

#### BEN

Well, the thing is basically, once somebody has the technology to build a Dyson sphere, you can build something that's much better than a Dyson sphere, so it would only exist as a weird __[Bryn laughs]__ vanity project.

#### BRYN

Almost certainly.

#### TIM

Like those pretend castles that people build.

#### BRYN

What is a Dyson sphere?

#### BEN

Uh, it's that thing from Halo. It's fundamentally the Halo, right? Like, Halos are Dyson spheres. Is that true or is that-- Are they slightly different?

#### BRYN

Halo is a computer game of which I have heard.

#### BEN

It is. __[Bryn laughs]__ Oh, yes! You don't play computer games! __[Tim joins in laughing]__ Um...

#### TIM

It's weird. It's weird! You'd think he would!

#### BEN

Well, no.

#### TIM

And yet he doesn't.

#### BRYN

I know science, guys, but you're talking about pop culture here. I think I have to lose a point for not knowing about Halo.

#### BEN

Yeah. I mean, eh, actually, yeah. To be honest, Halo is a reasonably seminal work, I suppose. __[Bryn laughs]__ *(getting quieter, kind of speaking to himself)* And actually, probably quite influential in science fiction, despite being very derivative, but all science fiction is kind of derivative in certain ways.

#### TIM

Oh, come back to us, Ben! Come back to us!

#### BEN

__[chuckles]__ Sorry.

#### TIM

He disappeared into his degree. Come back!

##### [Bryn laughs]

#### BEN

Oh! Ah! __[Tim chuckles]__ My degree and my career interest.

#### BRYN

I see Ben the literary theorist __[Tim laughs]__ has made an appearance.

#### BEN

Yeah. Um... No, so a Dyson sphere is, I think, it's like a-- it's a big ring with a surface on the inside? And as it rotates it creates a certain gravitational force because it's rotating. I think. Or is it the big doughnut? __[laughs]__

#### TIM

These aren't spheres! What are all the people talking about?!

#### BEN

No, I know. I think Dyson spheres are a little bit not spheres.

#### BRYN

You are *almost* there.

#### BEN

Ah, okay. Fair enough.

#### BRYN

Tim has poked the major hole in your description of what a Dyson sphere is.

#### TIM

These are *tubes,* these are *bands!* Not a sphere to be seen!

#### BEN

Oh! Hang on a minute! Are Dyson spheres the thing from *Matter*? From-- Oh, I was gonna bring it down.

#### BRYN

Yeah!

#### TIM

He's literally reaching up to a bookshelf next to him full of science fiction books. Iain M. Banks' *Matter,* the new "Culture" novel.

#### BEN

Yeah. *The Hydrogen Sonata*.

#### BRYN

If you are a science fiction fan, one of my favourite science fiction series is Iain M. Banks' "The Culture" novels, and he describes in those novels a whole, huge variety of places people can live in when you have the technology to create things more complicated than planets. But I don't think-- Actually, I think he describes the living environment in *Matter* a little differently. I think-- So, the ring you're describing--

#### BEN

Well, that's more of a Dyson onion. __[softly chuckles]__

#### BRYN

Yeah. The ring you're describing from Halo sounds pretty close. But the fundamental problem is it's not a sphere.

#### TIM

_(irritated)_ For-- Chr-- Ugh. What is it with scientists and science people and naming things that are not the thing that they are naming?

#### BEN

No no no no no no no! To be fair, to be fair-- No no no. A Dyson sphere *is* a sphere, it's just basically a sphere with a livable-- It's a hollow sphere with a livable surface on the *inside*.

#### TIM

_(still irritated)_ Then why did Bryn just say it's not a sphere? What is going on? __[chuckles]__

#### BRYN

Oh no. I said the thing *Ben* described [__TIM:__ Okay. Alright.] was not a sphere.

#### BEN

Yes. The Halo ring is like they peeled a Dyson sphere and, like, took a stripe of it.

#### TIM

Oh, like with an apple with a knife [__BEN:__ Yeah!] like you'd see a cool person do. Okay. Right. Alright. [__BRYN:__ Yeah.] Outburst retracted.

##### [Ben laughs]

#### BRYN

Yeah. So, the original description of a Dyson sphere is in fact an entire sphere built around a sun.

#### TIM

Right.

#### BRYN

And the idea is that people live on the inside of that sphere. And, in fact, the radius of that sphere is huge. It is in fact the same as the distance between the sun and the earth. So that sphere is *ridiculously* massive.

#### BEN

Lot of livable spa-- lot of real estate though. [__TIM:__ Yeah.] Property prices probably quite low.

#### BRYN

More than can be comfortably conceived by a human mind. __[chuckles]__

#### BEN

It would be quite the commute.

#### TIM

I think this is in *The Three-Body Problem,* but they use a very, very weak sun.

#### BRYN

So that you don't have to build it quite as far apart.

#### TIM

Yeah. Like, I think at one point somebody, like, travels from one side to the other and it doesn't take, you know, a hundred million years, because it's quite small.

#### BEN

Oh yeah. Bryn, have you read *The Three-Body Problem*?

#### BRYN

I haven't actually. No.

#### BEN

Would recommend.

#### BRYN

Okay.

#### BEN

Written by a Chinese theoretical physicist, and it gets *really* theoretical physicist-y.

#### BRYN

Yeah. I have heard good things. I should check it out. So, a Halo ring, one of the earliest descriptions of that was also in a sci-fi novel called *Ringworld* by Larry Niven. _(half-hearted)_ Uh, it's fine.

#### TIM

__[laughs]__ Oh, the withering fake praise!

#### BEN

Look. Look. It's an old sci-fi novel, right.

#### BRYN

I won't recommend it whole-heartedly. There are aspects of it that are problematic, both scientifically and... culturally.

#### BEN

I'm gonna guess at the gender politics not being okay and probably some eugenics because it's early-ish sci-fi.

#### TIM

Oh, they loved it! Oh, they loved it!

#### BRYN

I can't remember exactly, but there's definitely some problematic elements. But-- So, a Ringworld, or I assume this is what a Halo ring is.

#### BEN

Yes. It is fundamentally they lifted a Ringworld.

#### BRYN

It's essentially if you imagine that the earth when orbiting around the sun left a trail behind itself that eventually joined up into a single ring. So the entire orbit of the earth was in fact then a ring of material, [__TIM:__ Yeah.] and people could live on the inside of that ring, and the ring would slowly spin to create gravity, and people could live everywhere on the inside. That's what we would call a ring. If you take that ring and then you spin it on the other axis so it gradually creates a sphere around the sun, that's what a Dyson sphere would look like.

#### TIM

You get a very inconsistent gravity in a Dyson sphere though.

#### BRYN

Well, it would depend exactly how you were-- how you span it, but yes, you're right that you would not get the same gravity everywhere within a Dyson sphere.

#### TIM

No, 'cause there'd be, like-- there'd be points 'round the axis where it spins where the gravity disappears.

#### BRYN

More or less, yes. You would have-- Yeah. The equator would have the highest gravity, and the poles would have the lowest gravity. And I'm gonna give you another point for understanding that [__TIM:__ Ah!] because that's very good.

#### TIM

I remember you explained gravity to me in the last episode __[Bryn laughs]__ and, uh, __[chuckles]__ I was thoroughly chided.

#### BEN

But what force isn't it? __[pause]__ That creates that-- less--

#### TIM

Uh, centrifugal.

#### BRYN

Very nice.

#### TIM

It's not-- That's an effect, not a force.

#### BEN

And it is centripetal force, right?

#### BRYN

Nice. Very nice. Yep.

#### TIM

And also, I believe gravity is a thing that we call a thing, but we believe gravity is an effect resulting of a thing we don't understand, __[Bryn softly gasps]__ 'cause we don't actually have a good explanation for it.

#### BRYN

Very good. Very good. Yes.

#### TIM

Yes! _(yells)_ Bill Bryson! __[laughs]__

#### BRYN

You didn't remember the words, but you remembered the principle, so have two bonus points [__TIM:__ Yeah!] for remembering something from the previous episode.

#### BEN

Oh yeah! 'Cause it's what-- It's called, like, the weak... _(tentative)_ um, the weak attraction force? Or weak...

#### BRYN

No, you're thinking of one of the different forces.

#### BEN

Oh, okay.

#### BRYN

Gravity is actually the result of the curvature of space-time due to the presence of mass.

#### TIM

Imagine a rubber sheet [__BRYN:__ Exactly.] and an iron ball placed upon it. [__BRYN:__ Yep.] Well, guess what? It's not that. This another one of those lies we use.

##### [Ben and Bryn laugh]

#### BRYN

Yep. Not lies, models. Helpful models.

#### TIM

_(sarcastic)_ Sorry. Sorry. "Helpful models", brackets lies. __[Ben and Bryn laugh]__ It's a flat earth, I'm telling you!

#### BRYN

Once you have a Dyson sphere, you can have smaller things that are essentially part of a Dyson sphere, and a ring is essentially one of them. But, in fact, some models of Dyson spheres and some model of ring say, rather than filling in every possible space, why not have, you know, things roughly earth sized at regular intervals around the edge, for example, or have holes in your Dyson sphere, you know, so that some of the light can get out, and things like this. But, yeah. So, a Dyson sphere is in theory a complete enclosure. A Ringworld is a ring around-- And there are various things that are, like, plays on those two basic ideas, or partial, or somewhere between the two. For example, you could have a series of interlocking rings that met at the axis of rotation and, therefore, you could have multiple Ringworlds around a single star.

#### TIM

What's the point of this? Why would we bother?

#### BRYN

To create all this extra space. The amount of habitable space you would get from any of these projects [__TIM:__ Oh!] is absolutely huge.

#### TIM

'Cause we've got very limited Goldilocks zoning, so we can't just... go to another planet and go "we'll use this one" because, guess what? The atmosphere isn't thick enough or whatever so let's do a thing.

#### BRYN

We're talking about, you know, civilisations here like Stellar Firma which are powerful enough to basically create whatever they want. You have to-- [__TIM:__ Sure.] Because there is one very natural, very huge barrier to ever creating, certainly a Ringworld and, even more so, a Dyson sphere. What do you think that might be?

#### BEN

Uh, it's political will.

##### [Bryn laughs]

#### TIM

It's _(laughing)_ political will. It's been locked up in Congress for decades! __[Ben chuckles]__ The pork-barrelling, Bryn! The pork-barrelling... I'm gonna say it's you'd have to have so much stuff to ma-- The sheer mass that you're building you'd have to, like, go to another solar system, crush everything in it up into, what-- you know, base material, and then rebuild it some-- It would be a-- It would be really hard, Bryn! It'd be really difficult!

#### BRYN

Point to Tim. __[Ben laughs]__ Yeah.

#### TIM

Yes!

#### BRYN

You very much have to harvest the entire mass content of multiple solar systems to build any of these things.

#### TIM

We've just gotta work out some sort of [Haber process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haber_process) but to create usable matter from nothing.

#### BRYN

Yeah.

#### BEN

What is a Haber process?

#### TIM

It's how you make ammonia.

#### BEN

Oh.

#### BRYN

Yeah.

#### TIM

That's how all of the world's food is now produced because it creates it out of-- Oh, I've forgotten. Water? I can't remember. Anyway, it makes fertiliser.

#### BEN

_(crosstalk)_ Oh! There was a [*99% Invisible*](https://99percentinvisible.org/) about it, wasn't there?

#### TIM

Makes nitrates.

#### BEN

Or something.

#### BRYN

Yeah.

#### BEN

Oh, yeah.

#### TIM

There's lot of things about it _(stage whispers)_ 'cause the guy who made it also made loads of poison gases and it was really dark. And then it--

#### BEN

Oh, that was it! It was a [*Behind the Bastards*](https://www.iheart.com/podcast/105-behind-the-bastards-29236323/episode/fritz-haber-the-man-who-invented-48562360/).

#### TIM

Yeah. Yeah yeah yeah. He was a weird dude. __[chuckles]__

#### BEN

'Cause he was awful. __[chuckles]__ Yeah.

#### TIM

He was a weird dude. Anyway, Bryn, let's not talk about war criminals.

#### BRYN

But that's fine. __[Tim laughs]__ So, theoretically, if we indeed had the power of Stellar Firma and we could just pump out planets willy-nilly because we felt like it, we would in theory also have the ability to create larger, more complex habitable objects. And in fact, a planet is a naturally occurring object, but it is not necessarily the best design.

#### TIM

It's just the one we've got. It's got poles; they're useless.

#### BRYN

If we wanted to create a lot more livable space, then rings or Dyson spheres create huge amounts of space but also give you huge amounts of resource, because it's very easy to collect a lot of the radiation given off by a sun which is the primary source of power for any advanced civilisation.

The other one, which we mentioned "The Culture" novels just now, is what in "Culture" is described as an orbital, which is essential is a Ringworld but on a much smaller scale, and, rather than being the entire orbit of a planet, you know, you have planet-sized areas, a bunch of them bolted together into a ring, and you just set that ring into the same position as earth is and start it spinning, and you get a lot of free real estate but you don't have to spend quite as much-- you get more surface area for your buck, essentially. It takes less material to create the same amount of surface area, but you can create gravity the same way, and you get sunshine the same way, and it's a pretty efficient structure.

#### BEN

Yeah, that's the thing about the Dyson sphere or the Ringworld though. No night and day! Which should be really confusing. __[chuckles]__

#### TIM

Well, if you put it spinning, if you put the ring and then you put the-- it thin side on and then it's spinning, you would have a night and day.

#### BEN

Well, no, 'cause the side you're living on is always facing the sun. A bit like we can't see the dark side of the moon, right, because the moon is always facing the same way relative to us.

#### BRYN

Absolutely. Yep.

#### BEN

If you're on the inside of the ring and you look up--

#### TIM

Oh, sorry, we're on the [__BEN:__ Yes.] inside of the ring.

#### BEN

Also, if you're on the outside of the ring, you'd never get any sun. It would be the opposite problem. __[chuckles]__

#### BRYN

So, for example, in the original novel *Ringworld* by Larry Niven, you have the Ringworld and then you essentially have giant, solid blocks which are like these plates also orbiting the Ringworlds with big holes between each one just inside so that there is basically-- you have a roof approximately half the time to create a day/night cycle.

#### TIM

Ooohhh! Right. Right. Yeah, that'll work.

#### BRYN

Once you're creating giant structures in space anyway--

#### TIM

Why the hell not?

#### BRYN

Why not?

#### TIM

But couldn't you, like, just slightly tilt the angle so that you would spin and then, on that spin, you get sunlight, and then you get to the other side and then you be in the shade 'cause the back would be towards the sun. So that would work.

#### BEN

Not if you were orbiting the sun. Which is what a-- a Ringworld orbits a sun.

#### BRYN

You're thinking about the orbital concept that I described where the ring is floating away from the sun. And in that case, then you can have one side of the ring pointing the sun and one side of the ring pointing away from the sun. But if you're orbiting the sun, if your ring is around the sun, then the inside of the ring is fundamentally always pointing at the sun.

#### TIM

It's-- Yeah. Alright. Alright. Fine. I didn't solve a deep science problem with a half-assed thought __[Bryn chuckles]__ in a room in Brighton. __[Ben laughs]__ Alright, fine.

#### BRYN

But, since Dyson spheres were mentioned in the show, and indeed in another episode, which we won't get into, one of the clients asks for a planet capable of producing stars which, as we've discussed in previous times--

#### TIM

Not happening.

#### BRYN

--slight contradiction. You were fundamentally opposed to providing the client with such a thing, [__TIM:__ Yep.] 'cause it would mean they were infringing on the intellectual property of Stellar Firma.

#### BEN

Yeah. It's our USP.

#### BRYN

But as discussed, it would be a big problem size-wise as well, [__TIM:__ Mm.] because one of the defining features of a planet is that it is smaller than a star. But we've also mentioned Dyson spheres as well, and, given the ability of Stellar Firma to create the things it creates, it's likely that they would be capable of creating much more interesting, much larger structures as well as the planets they pump out on a weekly basis.

#### TIM

I've got a confession to make. Now we've discussed and talked about Dyson spheres, I had *no idea* at all what a Dyson sphere was when we were doing the episode. I thought it was something else! Luckily, it seems I didn't say anything specific enough about it. __[chuckles]__

#### BEN

Remember, I also answered that question wrong so I... I also didn't know what a Dyson sphere was.

#### TIM

Neither of us-- So we did an episode where we were talking about Dyson spheres and __[breaking into laughter]__ neither of us knew.

#### BEN

I mean, I knew it was a sci-fi planetary like hab concept so that was enough to get us through the episode.

#### BRYN

So, sadly, this year we didn't have enough time to discuss the concept broached in episode 29 where we met a four-dimensional being who existed within our space. I was gonna ask you about extra-dimensions and higher dimensional--

#### TIM

Again, read *The Three-Body Problem*. *The Three-Body Problem* is *all* about that stuff, Bryn. You'd love it!

#### BRYN

In episode 38, we were building a workout zone for someone, and I wanted to ask you why you didn't just say, "let's give them a nice high-gravity planet"?

#### BEN

Uhhhh, 'cause--

#### TIM

Alright. Hindsight's 20/20. __[laughs]__

#### BEN

Yeah, 'cause we didn't think about it is the fundamental answer.

#### BRYN

In one of David's Fact Corners, he built-- he described a civilisation which built a statue which was 0.5 astronomical units high. Didn't get to ask you if you knew what an astronomical unit was or exactly how big that statue would be.

#### TIM

I wrote this, Bryn, and I-- because I knew--'cause this is Patreon stuff for people who haven't listened to this--I *knew* this would come up. I looked it up, and an astronomical unit is the distance from the earth to the sun, so I looked it up so when I decided to, like, build something that high, I was like, "is that, like, pretty big but not so big as to be, like, across an entire galaxy?" So, *yes*, Bryn. *I* *do know*!

#### BRYN

Well, let's just say, even building that would encounter the same problem as building a Dyson sphere. There is probably not enough stuff inside the solar system--

#### TIM

_(getting louder)_ It was a funny joke, Bryn!

##### [Ben laughs]

#### BRYN

--to construct something that large.

#### BEN

_(crosstalk)_ It could have been very, very thin.

#### TIM

It was a funny joke that people were supposed to enjoy! __[chuckles]__ To be fair, the whole point of that was they built it and it destroyed their society, because it made them crash into the sun. __[Ben laughs]__ So, to be fair--

#### BRYN

I could do an entire episode on just that three-minute segment alone, __[Tim laughs]__ let me tell you. So, there's some stuff, sadly--

#### TIM

_(crosstalk)_ And that's one I tried to research.

#### BEN

So, if you wanna know what ground Bryn's gears so much, subscribe to Patreon.

##### [Bryn and Tim laugh]

#### BRYN

So, sadly, there's always more we could discuss despite the much smaller presence of science in season two, and I for one am very excited to see where Trexel and David end up in season three and how much science is or isn't involved there.

#### BEN

Well, as Tim said, we'll sit down and work it out.

##### [Tim laughs]

#### TIM

Oh, speaking of which, Ben, we should really book in that chat. Anyway... __[laughs]__

#### BEN

Yeah, we probably should actually. Yeah.

#### BRYN

Until then, all hail the Board.

#### BEN

All hail the Board.

#### TIM

All hail the Board. May it preserve and keep you!
