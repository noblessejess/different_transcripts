##### [show theme]

#### IMOGEN

Rusty Quill presents: Stellar Firma.

##### [theme continues]

##### [rustling of plants, as door whooshes to admit a mysterious humming figure]

#### DAVID

Uh, oh Trexel... Wait, who--? [__FERN CREATURE:__ Oh. Ah!] What--? Who, who are, who are you? What are you doing in this office? Why have you got ferns stuck to your head?

#### FERN CREATURE

_(speaks in a voice that sounds like it has a vocoder applied)_ Hallo, I noticed that you can see me... Do you see me?

#### DAVID

Y-Yes. You're standing there. You've got one foot in a plant pot. And the other one has a piece of metal strapped to it. I don't-- Who are you?

#### FERN CREATURE

Hallo sir, I am a fern creature. And I'm here to deliver a ferning selection to your... uh, your lovely room. Will you be [__DAVID:__ Um.] partaking in ferns today, sir?

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Records indicate that no fern creature or fern-obsessed salesperson is currently registered as a visitor to this station. My guess is, that this is a weirdo who is from nowhere.

#### DAVID

_(hesitantly)_ Uh... no Fern Creature. I don't want to... buy any ferns from you.

##### [rustling as if leaves are sobbing]

#### FERN CREATURE

Oh, you make Fern Creature so sad.

#### DAVID

Uh...

#### FERN CREATURE

Oh no, I grew these specially for you, sir. And your s-- your room, [__DAVID:__ Um.] there's no life in your room. Oh, sad creature.

#### DAVID

Uh... I'm sorry to make you sad, Fern Creature, but I-I don't want to get any ferns. I don't have any money, and there's not really any shelves to put them anywhere. Um...

#### FERN CREATURE

But you *believe* that you *could* have bought a fern from me? That I am a fern seller?

#### DAVID

That is a, a weird question. Um, that I-- I am now getting suspicious... of you...

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ If your suspicions are only raised now, then I am deeply disappointed in you.

#### FERN CREATURE

_(softly)_ Deactivate voice modulator.

##### [two beeps as it deactivates]

#### HARTRO

_(whispers)_ It's me!

#### DAVID

It's who?

#### HARTRO

It's me, it's Hartro.

#### DAVID

Har-Hartro, [__HARTRO:__ It's me--] why are you dressed as Fern Creature, beloved fern salesman?

#### HARTRO

Ye-Yes! See! Did you-- You believed it! Didn't you, David 7? [__DAVID:__ Uh...] Did you believe it? [__DAVID:__ Yeah...] You bought it!

#### DAVID

I did. I did. Which is-- It's, it's weird actually, because now that I think about it, you didn't actually change your face at all. You just glued some ferns to your head, and put your foot in a plant pot, but--

#### HARTRO

But it's the, it's the whole thing. I mean, I-I was, I was it, I was feeling it. I was--

#### DAVID

Yeah, you we-- No, you-- At that time you *were* Fern Creature. [__HARTRO:__ That's right.] I mean, I-I almost became Fe-- I was so convinced, I started to think *I* was Fern Creature, [__HARTRO:__ This is--] as well, that's, that's incredible.

#### HARTRO

This is the thing, David 7. I'm, I'm good at this. I'm-- I can blend... I can blend in any-anywhere. I mean, if the moment calls for it, I can be a... a coffee creature. I could be a newspaper creature. I could be a window-washing creature. I mean, the things I can do to blend in-- Is this is really going well for me?

#### DAVID

Yeah, as long as it's, sort of, a creature bit. Um, okay.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ And come Hallowe'en, you will be spoiled for choice!

#### HARTRO

But I'm getting information. I'm, I-I-I'm--

#### DAVID

Ooh, yes!

#### HARTRO

Yeah!

#### DAVID

Information! Well, what information have, have you got?

#### DAVID

So much information, some of it--

##### [door whooshes as Trexel enters]

#### TREXEL

Ah, here we are!

#### HARTRO

Ah, oh...

#### TREXEL

Da-David?

#### HARTRO

_(softly)_ Activate voice modulator.

##### [two beeps as it activates, amidst rustling leaves]

#### TREXEL

We appear to-- _(ecstatic)_ Fern Creature!

#### FERN CREATURE

Oh, oh.

#### TREXEL

_(enthusiastic)_ Ah, how long has it been? Two days? Three? How are you doing Fern Cre-- Still selling ferns?

#### FERN CREATURE

I am. Nice to see you again.

#### TREXEL

You know, I've already bought two ferns, so I'm you-- But guess what? I'm here to buy a third. I love your ferns, Fern Creature! David, have you bought one of Fern Creature's ferns?

#### DAVID

Uh...

#### TREXEL

They're great ferns, David, I can't tell you!

#### FERN CREATURE

Don't make fern creature sad. __[makes noises of faux sadness]__

#### TREXEL

No, y-- I would n-- Yeah, in fact-- Oh, oh, Fern Creature, please hang on.

David, can you, can you, can you loan me some more credits? I want to [__DAVID:__ Why?] buy another fern from [__DAVID:__ No.] this delightful fern creature.

#### DAVID

_(whisper)_ But Trexel, I don't have any, any more credits, I-- we've burned through the David's Place savings I had, like my nest egg is gone now. What-- And you want to buy ferns?

#### COIN FRIEND

__[buzz]__ That's him! That's the one who depleted our credits. Oh, to be a Coin Friend without coin! __[weeps digitally]__

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Coin Friend sorrow detected. Security checking their balance, and counting the hours until payday.

#### FERN CREATURE

You might be able to do something [__TREXEL:__ Yes!] else to gain a fern from me, hmmm?

#### DAVID

David, I think you're going to have to dance for a fern. [__DAVID:__ No.] I'm sorry, I know it's degrading, [__DAVID:__ No you--] but we need these ferns.

#### DAVID

*You* barter with Fern Creature. I don't have anywhere to put ferns. I told Fern Creature, I have no shelves.

#### TREXEL

Fern Creature, now-- Hang on a minute.

#### FERN CREATURE

Yes?

#### TREXEL

Fern Creature, why are you *here*? In, in our consulting room at this time. Normally it's Hartro that would--

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Even you can do this, Trexel. It's an easy one.

#### FERN CREATURE

You look like you're thinking about ferns... Are you thinking about ferns?

#### TREXEL

Fern Creature, this is-- I can't even believe I'm saying this, but are you--

#### FERN CREATURE

Deactivate voice modulator.

##### [two beeps for deactivation]

#### TREXEL

You--

#### HARTRO

It's, it's me!

#### TREXEL

Ha-Hartro!

#### HARTRO

It's me!

#### TREXEL

_(roaring)_ I knew it!

#### HARTRO

Ah! No, you didn't! No, you didn't! You did not.

#### TREXEL

_(roaring)_ I knew it! I could tell, I could always tell! [__HARTRO:__ No.] I always knew! I bought those ferns for a joke to, to humiliate you because you're the one who should be humiliated. [__HARTRO:__ David--] You're the humiliated one. People are pointing, and saying, 'You idiot!'

#### DAVID

Well, I mean they, they are, but they're not pointing at Hartro.

#### HARTRO

No, it's you. No-- People are starting to call you 'Fern Boy'. It is hilarious.

#### TREXEL

_(wailing)_ No! Gah!

#### HARTRO

Yes, yes, yes.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ I haven't had this much fun spreading a nickname since 'Weatherboy'. Although character assassination is less fun when the character is already dead.

#### HARTRO

They've named a drink after *you* in the Cosmic Lounge. I know you can't, can't go in there.

#### TREXEL

But what did, what did they call it?

#### HARTRO

Fern Boy.

#### TREXEL

Nooooo!

#### HARTRO

Yes!

#### TREXEL

_(wailing)_ I don't want to be known as Fern Boy!

#### HARTRO

Ah, nobody buys it, but-- __[sighs]__

#### TREXEL

It's just like school all over again. Except instead of 'Fern Boy', then it was 'Go Away Trexel, No-one Likes You'.

#### HARTRO

Yeah, there are quite a few drinks named after you in that bar.

#### TREXEL

Yeah, the, the Trexel Go-Home. The Burning Hot Trexel Shame. What's That -- An Exploding Planet in My Mouth, Bet Trexel Made It, Guffaw, Guffaw.

They're all long names and not particularly witty, but they're hurtful!

#### HARTRO

But back to me!

#### TREXEL

Hurtful.

#### HARTRO

'Cause look--

#### TREXEL

Yes, why, why have you been pretending to be Fern Creature?

#### HARTRO

Good question.

#### TREXEL

This absolutely convincing character that is beloved by most of the senior staff?

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ No-one is buying this. Stop selling it.

#### HARTRO

Well. There's a good reason. I am getting some information. I am getting so much information, I have to sift through it at night in my room, and, and what is important and what isn't. And I have a whole wall dedicated to information and, and little red lines connecting this one to that one to this one to that one.

#### TREXEL

Oh, you've got a plotting wall.

#### DAVID

What does see information *say*?

#### HARTRO

I, I managed to get a memo from S--

#### TREXEL

Wow, that's really interesting. But I think before we get into that, we should really do the review, eh?

#### DAVID

Um?

##### [noises of disbelief and confusion from David and Hartro]

#### TREXEL

Because that's what we're all here for, the review? Reviewing our work. So let's all just put that-- just table that motion over there, and get on with the review. How has Trexel done? I bet it's great. [__DAVID:__ No, but--]

_(crosstalk, singing)_ Oh, Trexel! [__DAVID:__ Trexel, no but-- Trexel--]

Oh Trexel, we're so happy with you!

Oh, Trexel! Oh Trexel, it's time for review

All the things that you've done

And the things that we've seen

Are so good for you and me!

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ Okay, Trexel-- No Trexel-- But no, Trexel. Trexel? Trexel?

#### HARTRO

_(crosstalk)_ Actually-- Trexel? Stop. Stop!

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ Oh, it's the-- What-- yeah?

#### DAVID

Trexel? You know-- I mean, yeah, we're doing the review-- You know, we don't actually have to... review... anything, right?

#### TREXEL

What do you mean?

#### DAVID

Well... __[sighs]__ Oh Hartro, you tell him.

#### HARTRO

Trexel, it's, it's, it's-- the, the sham's up, alright. I just-- I'm, I'm, [__TREXEL:__ The sham?] I am rubber stamping everything that comes from this department. Um, I-- the reviews come to me, I'm like, 'Yes, yes, yes. Stamp, stamp, stamp.'

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ _(flat)_ Oh no, we're not going to lose the rigorous quality checks, are we? Whatever, shall we do?

#### HARTRO

Listen, [__TREXEL:__ Oh.] we've got bigger fish to fry. I mean-- I did-- Sorry, I didn't say fish, I did not say fish. We have got more--

#### TREXEL

_(resigned)_ Bigger brooms to sweep.

#### HARTRO

Yes.

#### TREXEL

I understand. I just, I just always thought that, you know--

#### DAVID

Bigger ferns to pot.

#### HARTRO

That's right. Thank you.

#### TREXEL

No, it's-- Sure. You know, I, I understand, you know, we don't-- we're not focussed-- we're focussed on other things now, you know. We've got David's plan, and your plan, and--

#### HARTRO

There's a plot!

#### TREXEL

It's *our* plan, Trexel. It's everyone's, everyone's plan.

#### TREXEL

__[burbles in agreement]__ I under-- I understand. I just, you know, I just always thought that at the heart of it, really, you know, with-- There's other things going on, there's plots and things, but you know, really when you get down to the, to the real core of, y'know, what, what we're all about, it's about me and my designs, and, and my plans--

#### HARTRO

This thing does go very deep. I mean, this is-- We're talking high level. I mean, we're talking high level stuff here.

#### TREXEL

Yeah...

#### DAVID

It goes all the way to the top.

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ Yeah, yeah, but, but, but you know--

#### HARTRO

_(crosstalk)_ Well, I mean--

#### TREXEL

_(getting more and more high-pitched)_ --I, I'm, I'm, I'm always at the top, you know? On the pyramid of priorities, so I think, really think we should, we should just, you know, just talk a little bit about, about, about our, our, our management consulting efforts, and talk about how good they are. I just think we should just cover that a little bit.

#### HARTRO

_(crosstalk)_ Alright, alright, alright, alright. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Okay. So, so there is some-- I-I-I've got the review here... uh, in this pot here. __[rustling and clacking]__ This fern is-- [__TREXEL:__ Mm-hmm.] I keep my paperwork here, and-- Oh look! Oh, the memo, the memo from Standards is here as well.

#### DAVID

Oh.

#### HARTRO

So, this is what I found!

##### [Trexel mumbles]

#### HARTRO

It's incredibly important. Basically... it says that they've got to get things in line before the stakeholder's meeting, which is happening at the end of the quarter.

#### DAVID/TREXEL

_(together)_ Stakeholder's meeting?

#### HARTRO

Yes! It's underlined, it's highlighted, I seriously think that's important.

#### TREXEL

Wait, wait, wait. Hartro?

#### HARTRO

Yes?

#### TREXEL

What colour is it highlighted in?

#### HARTRO

It's highlighted in yellow.

#### TREXEL

That's plotting colour!

#### DAVID

Yeah...

#### TREXEL

That's the plotting colour. Clearly Standards have some sort of highlighter-based plot. [__DAVID:__ Wait, and then--] We must find all their stationery, and confiscate it!

#### DAVID

Actually, also-- Hartro, um, Standards did, did come to me.

#### HARTRO

They came to you?

#### DAVID

A couple of days ago...

#### HARTRO

_(incensed)_ Why didn't-- Why didn't you tell me this, David?

#### TREXEL

_(background)_ Always coming to the golden boy.

#### HARTRO

This is the sort [__DAVID:__ 'Cause--] of stuff that needs to go on my wall!

#### DAVID

No, but, but-- Because I am telling you now. Because we can't communicate, this is first opportunity--

#### HARTRO

You should have told me, before you told me.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ A harsh policy. But fair.

#### TREXEL

In many ways I should have told you, but you were pretending to be a fern, who I thought was my friend!

#### DAVID

Yeah. But your fern creature act spun me for a loop. A loop!

#### HARTRO

I know, very good. I'm very good.

#### DAVID

Ah, no, but they came to see me, and they were talking about, like, my plot with IMOGEN. I don't have a plot with IMOGEN, [__HARTRO:__ Do you?] but they thought-- No, they thought I had a plot with IMOGEN--

#### HARTRO

Wait. Look at me in the eyes--

#### DAVID

Yes?

#### HARTRO

--and tell me: _(slowly)_ Do you have a plot with IMOGEN?

#### DAVID

_(whispered in exhale)_ No...

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ I also say no. If anyone cares.

#### HARTRO

Okay, he doesn't.

#### TREXEL

Now, David, look in my eyes.

#### DAVID

Yes?

#### TREXEL

_(enunciating)_ Have you seen any drinks just hanging about?

#### DAVID

_(whispers)_ There's a slurry dispenser in that cupboard.

#### TREXEL

Okay. Well. Regular one, fine. Just checking, just checking in case there was bonus drinks.

#### HARTRO

I know, know, know how this works. I know how this works. You need-- Those two, we can't really judge it on that. We need to put him under distress. And then ask a question.

#### DAVID

Wait, what?

#### TREXEL

Oh, we need to distress David, and then interrogate him about his ties to IMOGEN?

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ No, I don't want to be-- I'm-- Uh, no. Look I'm usually--

#### HARTRO

_(crosstalk)_ Yes!

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ Okay, fine. I've got a minute!

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ No, I'm usually distressed!

#### HARTRO

We need to find out, David!

#### DAVID

No, yeah, that's fine. I'm not doing anything with IMOGEN! I don't what--

#### TREXEL

Right. David, sit in this chair. __[scraping noise]__ I've got some twine here. Just tie you into this chair, yeah.

##### [sounds of brief struggle]

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Ooh! A new type of crime. What fun.

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ Look, okay, I am letting you do this.

#### TREXEL

Uh, IMOGEN, have we got any sort of anglepoise lamps? Any sort of a-- __[twang of springs]__ Uh, thank you IMOGEN.

#### HARTRO

Wait, wait, wait, wait. But we're asking IMOGEN to help us see if David has a thing with IMOGEN.

#### TREXEL

Okay, that's true. I don't need your anglepoise lamp IMOGEN. __[click]__ I'm just going to yell the word 'light' into your face. 'Cause that's kind of the same effect.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

LIGHT!

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

LIGHT!

#### HARTRO

Okay. I'm gonna ask him something.

#### TREXEL

LIGHTS!

#### DAVID

Yes, Hartro? What do you want to know?

#### TREXEL

LIGHTS!

#### HARTRO

Do you...

#### TREXEL

LIGHTS!

#### DAVID

Yeah?

#### HARTRO

...think my fern creature...

#### TREXEL

Light!

#### HARTRO

...was convincing?

#### TREXEL

Ligh-- Hartro, I thought we were trying to find out whether or not IMOGEN was involved? You've got--

#### HARTRO

Sorry.

#### DAVID

But, but yes, the answer is yes. Obviously. Yes.

#### HARTRO

Obviously, he has nothing to do with IMOGEN.

#### DAVID

It was a masterpiece, so--

#### TREXEL

Well, I mean, I think you've got side-tracked from the real issue, which is: Are you absolutely sure there's no special extra drinks, David?

#### DAVID

There could be. I ha-- [__HARTRO:__ Ooh.] I don't know how many panels there are, or cupboards in this room. I keep pressing things, and new things, appear. There was a sort of shower thing, but only for your hands that I found...

#### TREXEL

It's called a sink, David, you weirdo.

#### HARTRO

There's bubbly slurry, I showed you last week.

#### DAVID

No, no, no, it wasn't a sink. It was like-- it's a box that you just poke your hand into, [__TREXEL:__ Oh!] and it's only big enough for your hand. And then it kind of just sprays stuff on it. And, and I think it comes out cleaner.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ On Old Earth, such devices were used to punish commuters by giving them wet, slimy hands.

#### TREXEL

You know, I'd always be frightened if, if I ever found a mystery box in the wall that was like, 'Hey, put your hands in there'. My immediate thought is, it's going to cut off my hands. I mean, [__DAVID:__ Trexel.] maybe that's just me, but you know-- What?

#### DAVID

Trexel, I was so bored.

#### TREXEL

Oh, I see. So you were, like, 'You know what, if it chops off my hands, fine.'

#### DAVID

At least it's something to do.

#### HARTRO

I never put my hands anywhere I can't see them.

#### TREXEL

Yeah. You keep your hands in your eyeline at all times.

#### DAVID

Not even in your pockets?

#### HARTRO

No, have you ever seen--? Never.

#### TREXEL

Ah, no, never! Never!

#### HARTRO

__[rustling]__ I mean, my hands are ferns at the moment, but I can see them [__TREXEL:__ Yeah.] amidst the-- it's obvious. I'm just going to put a few of these about, is that alright?

#### TREXEL

Ah, no, please, please. This room is a bit drab. [__DAVID:__ Oh, but th--] But now David--

#### DAVID

No, there are no shelves. There are n--

#### TREXEL

_(oblivious)_ This is really important. If you've ever got something in your pocket--

#### HARTRO

Of course there's a shelf. Look, there's a shelf right here. __[mechanical whirring]__ You just wave your hand.

#### DAVID

How did you find that?

##### [clinking as Hartro deploys ferns]

#### HARTRO

A fern shelf.

#### TREXEL

_(oblivious)_ If you ever find yourself in need of putting your hand in a pocket--

#### DAVID

How does everybody know how this room works except for me?!

#### TREXEL

_(oblivious)_ --you just open it up so you can see all the way in as well. So you don't ever lose track of your hand. [__DAVID:__ Quite.] Oh, this room's looking nicer already.

#### HARTRO

There we go.

#### DAVID

Yes, it is a bit more, you know, bright.

#### TREXEL

So anyway, the memo!

#### HARTRO

The memo.

#### TREXEL

So Standards is having some sort of quarterly meeting and I, Trexel Geistman, am core to their plans. As I always expected. Also, [__HARTRO:__ Actually...] David was mentioned.

#### HARTRO

Funny you should mention, it's David, this time, David 7, it says specifically, look here on the memo.

#### TREXEL

No I think-- Let me just have a look at that.

#### HARTRO

"David remains the best option for submission at this time." You see where it says [__DAVID:__ Trexel? Hey Trexel?] in yellow highlighter.

#### DAVID

Do not eat that memo.

##### [Trexel mumbles sotto voce]

#### HARTRO

No, take that-- that is evidence.

#### DAVID

Do not eat that.

##### [Trexel attempts to devour the memo messily; Hartro and David protest while Trexel smugly chuckles and chews]

#### HARTRO

That's evidence! Right!

##### [smashes a fern on Trexel, who disgorges the memo]

#### DAVID

Right, oh...

#### HARTRO

I liked that fern!

#### TREXEL

That fern hurt.

#### DAVID

Thank goodness that was saliva-resistant paper.

#### HARTRO

Of course the Board write everything on saliva-resistant paper. They're not stupid!

#### DAVID

Yeah, I can see why.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ The Trexel-resistant memos are some of my finest work.

#### DAVID

Anyway. So they think that I'm impor-- That, well, that, that makes sense. That's, that, that makes sense as to why they were asking me about IMOGEN's non-existent plan, because the--

#### TREXEL

Doesn't make sense to me.

#### DAVID

Well, they were worried if I'm the most, like-- if I'm the key, if I'm like [__HARTRO:__ Yeah.] [__TREXEL:__ The key? Oh wow.] the, the best option, it says here--

#### TREXEL

Now, let's talk about ideas above their station. You've gone from lowly clone to key to the universe, just because you've got a wet piece of paper covered in someone's saliva! [__DAVID:__ Yeah, you're, you're right.] I think you should wind your neck in David, personally.

#### DAVID

Yeah, no, you're right. Oh well, tell, tell you what Trexel, tell you what. Would you like to punch my neck? Do you just-- Do you wanna--?

#### TREXEL

No, I'm quite alright not punching your neck because-- I, I could!

#### DAVID

Do you not want to punch the neck of this lowly clone?

#### TREXEL

No, I could, and it would probably break your neck in half, so I wouldn't do it, David.

#### DAVID

_(humouring Trexel)_ Mmm. My poor little head would snap off and bounce around--

#### TREXEL

Yeah, yeah. I think that would happen.

#### DAVID

--and end up in a fern pot.

#### TREXEL

It wouldn't, it wouldn't--

#### HARTRO

Alright, boys, boys, boys. What is this violence? Now cut it out, we've got things to do. And it does remind me -- all of my little red things, just, they connect to you, David, on my wall of... clarity, at home. They're all coming back to you!

#### TREXEL

All connecting to David! So I think what we should do, [__HARTRO:__ Yes.] is not lose sight of the core issue, which is we should review *my* work from the past week! __[Hartro sighs]__ So let's just review that now, shall we?

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ Trexel. It doesn't--

#### TREXEL

Because I think we've really lost sight of what matters here! Which is Trexel K G K Geistman, Esquire, established 2 billion and shut up!

#### DAVID

Trexel, it doesn't matter!

#### HARTRO

It doesn't--

#### TREXEL

Oh, it doesn't matter?

#### DAVID

No.

#### HARTRO

No, i--

#### TREXEL

_(petulant)_ Oh, oh, it doesn't matter! Oh sorry! I wasn't aware that it didn't matter! Oh, sorry! I feel such a fool! You know what else might not matter?! If, if things aren't mattering, you know, if just things don't just matter? [__DAVID:__ Oh no...] You know, if things just all don't matter all of a sudden! Maybe it wouldn't matter [__DAVID:__ Mm-hmm.] if I was just to go out and tell people that, I don't know, that Hartro is a double agent and David's planning to overthrow the Board--

#### HARTRO

_(crosstalk)_ Wh-What?

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ Okay...

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ Maybe I should just go and do that!

#### HARTRO

_(crosstalk)_ Wait up!

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ You know what? You're right. I'll just hop out of here, and go start yelling now!

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ Alright. Okay Trexel. Okay Trexel--

#### TREXEL

Alright! Where's my hat? I'll wear a hat! __[starts banging panels]__

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ You are going... You are going nowhere, mister!

#### HARTRO

_(crosstalk)_ I just... No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no! You sit down! Mister!

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ Get off my--! Get off my c--

##### [sounds of a struggle]

#### TREXEL

Oh, that was a very forceful put down, David. That was a little frightening.

#### HARTRO

Well done, David 7.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### HARTRO

I need to remember that move.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### HARTRO

That's right. You sit there with your ferns. __[rustling]__

#### TREXEL

_(softly)_ Ooh, I like... I like these ferns.

#### HARTRO

You hold these.

#### DAVID

Take that. Maybe, take that one as well.

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### DAVID

And, maybe, that one or two.

#### TREXEL

Oh it's, too many, too many ferns...

#### DAVID

No, just, just hold them.

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### HARTRO

Now I, I, I may have said that the reviews... don't matter that much.

#### TREXEL

You did! You did! You said that!

#### HARTRO

I did-- I meant, they don't matter so much to David 7 and I, because they-- they're so much about you...

#### TREXEL

Right?

#### HARTRO

They're really, they're really just reviews of you.

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### HARTRO

You... you're really important--

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### HARTRO

--in these reviews.

#### TREXEL

Yes. Yes, this makes sense. I like this. [__HARTRO:__ Yeah.] Yeah. Keep going.

#### DAVID

And, um, and they don't matter because they're all so... good.

#### TREXEL

I want to hear-- [__HARTRO:__ They are!] [__DAVID:__ Sort of...] I want to hear why they're good. I want to hear specifically [__HARTRO:__ That's right, that's right.] what's good. What's good about them?

#### HARTRO

Where's my file fern. One of you, uh, __[rustling]__ that one, Trexel, I need that one back.

#### TREXEL

Oh, hang on, there... there you go.

#### HARTRO

That's where I keep my paper. Oh, here we go. Here we go. The reviews. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Oh, I-I'll just-- I can whip through these, and spend some time with these, and, and tell you that--

#### TREXEL

Well, you should already have notes written up, because obviously you've already done the reviews. So just [__HARTRO:__ I do!] read, read out, read out what your thoughts-- You don't need to think about it [__DAVID:__ Yeah...] just read out what you thought, but from the reviews you've already done.

#### HARTRO

Ohh...

#### DAVID

Just, you know, just like the, the thing about the, um...

#### HARTRO

The Gademy Academy!

#### DAVID

Yes, you know, the, the, [__HARTRO:__ That one!] the, the really loud school that needed us to, uh, help them with their, with their loud supplies and, and being loud on a budget.

#### HARTRO

I--they loved you.

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### HARTRO

And they loved your suggestions. [__TREXEL:__ Which?] They said, wasn't that fantastic to, um, suggest putting some ears [__TREXEL:__ Uh-huh.] on the side of the school [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] with a, with a cornucopia of sound projectile, [__DAVID:__ Right...] uh, science.

#### DAVID

...don't... I just, I don't, um...

#### TREXEL

You know what, Hartro? That I was thinking exactly the same thing. What a suggestion from me!

#### DAVID

No, what a good--- yes. What a good--

#### TREXEL

What a sugg-- Ears on the school!

#### HARTRO

Yeah, do you like that?

#### TREXEL

Put ears on the school! I-- You know what I was having a good day, that day. Great day. Great day.

#### DAVID

Oh, what a good--

#### TREXEL

Come on, come on. What about the others?

#### DAVID

--some real, real...

Are you sure we have to go through the others? I think we could just--

#### TREXEL

I think we do. I think we should. I think we must!

#### DAVID

Okay...

#### HARTRO

There were, um...

#### DAVID

_(talking sideways)_ It's the, it's the Diabolical Flotilla Actors' Guild.

#### TREXEL

Yes!

#### HARTRO

Actors' Guild?

#### DAVID

The Actors' Guild

#### HARTRO

yes.

#### TREXEL

Don't need to talk out of the side of your mouth, David. I can hear you just as well.

#### DAVID

No, I was just, I was just thinking really hard about the, the, the good things that Hartro is going to be saying about the thing that she knows about.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Yes! The thing about this situation is how much good quality thinking is going on. Really! Top notch!

#### HARTRO

That's right. And Trexel.

#### TREXEL

Yes?

#### HARTRO

The thing is, you know, it might be hard for David 7 to hear how well you're doing.

#### TREXEL

I know, it's tough.

#### HARTRO

Okay?

#### DAVID

This is, this is--

#### TREXEL

It's tough.

#### DAVID

_(humouring Trexel)_ Yes, I'm very distressed. I'm as distressed as, as you wanted to make me earlier. I'm so--

#### TREXEL

Have a fern for comfort. __[rustling]__

#### DAVID

Yeah, no, no, thank, thank you.

#### HARTRO

Ferns all round.

#### DAVID

I'm going to bury my head in this fern out of distress.

#### HARTRO

Yeah, tho-those actors. They... they've got a new season, [__TREXEL:__ Mm-hmm.] and it's just something to be seen. They've got these... plays that they're going to be performing...

#### TREXEL

Sure. Which one did you like?

#### HARTRO

I really liked that second one. Uh, with the, the, the dogs...

#### TREXEL

Yes?

#### HARTRO

You had dogs, um, dancing.

#### TREXEL

Arf!

#### HARTRO

That was, it was the dancing dogs.

#### TREXEL

How'd they learn to dance? That's so stupid, how did they learn to dance!

#### HARTRO

Well, that, that song in particular: How Do-- How Did They Learn?

#### TREXEL

_(excited)_ Oh, I remember it!

_(singing)_ Oh.... how do they dance?

Who taught these dogs to dance? Do-do-di-do-do.

That pooch sure can prance!

Whooo in the hell, taught these dogs to dance?

Was it the butcher, the baker, the candlestick maker?

Who taught these dogs to dance?

'Cause' -- duh-duh-duh

##### [Hartro and David attempt to join in with varying enthusiasm and ability]

#### Trexel

_(singing)_ When a dog likes to dance -- dah-dah-da-da-dah

And a dog likes to prance -- dah-dah-da-da-dah

There's just one way to be!

A dancing dog!

Jazz hands! Jazz paws!

#### HARTRO

Yeah!

#### TREXEL

Jazz paws!

#### DAVID

Yeah, yeah, yeah, you know, *Dancing Dogs 2: Rex's Revenge*.

#### TREXEL

Ah, bad Rex. Two down, two to go!

#### DAVID

Okay, we're going to have to really... just go through all the plays?

#### TREXEL

No, no. The other two briefs, the other two briefs!

#### DAVID

Oh, thank the Board.

#### HARTRO

Oh, there's two more! I-- The two... best ones!

#### DAVID

Yep. Oh, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep. Yep. That's Construct-a-Creature.

#### HARTRO

David 7, that third one...?

#### DAVID

Construct-a... Construct-a-Creature. Yes. No, um, good, uh, examining on me if I can remember it. Um, I'm going to-- you're test--

#### HARTRO

I'm testing you.

#### DAVID

Yes, you're testing me, and [__TREXEL:__ Test him!] uh, it's Construct-a-Creature, and they wanted us to help them out with some legal trouble because of their--

#### HARTRO

Are you sure?

#### DAVID

--sub-standard... Yep, sub-standards safety procedures with their creatures, which mauled and killed--

#### TREXEL

Stop talking David! What did Hartro think? That's what I want to know.

#### HARTRO

Brilliant...

#### TREXEL

Brilliant! That's what I like to hear.

#### HARTRO

They don't have any more problems...

#### DAVID

Yeah.

#### HARTRO

Legal or... mental or... emotional... or...

#### TREXEL

They're just well-rounded, happy. They've got the emotional support they need.

#### HARTRO

They did!

#### TREXEL

Here's a question.

#### HARTRO

Huh, yeah?

#### TREXEL

Why? What was it that we did that particularly helped them?

#### HARTRO

It's, it's, it's something you did Trexel.

#### TREXEL

Is it? Oh, I, I'm... I wait with bated breath.

#### TREXEL

You got those creatures-- I can't believe you don't remember sitting with them, and hugging each [__TREXEL:__ Yes...] and every one of those [__TREXEL:__ Yes...] creatures... [__TREXEL:__ Yes...]

#### DAVID

Calm the creatures down, [__TREXEL:__ Calm them down.] that's what we said. We said just ca-calm, calm, calm with cuddles.

#### TREXEL

Calm them down so they won't maul anyone. Don't change the, the, the, the product at source, that'd be really expensive to retool. Create, create the monstrosities, [__DAVID:__ And it--] and then calm them down, soothe them...

#### DAVID

And it went so well, [__HARTRO:__ Mmm.] Stellar Firma had to blow them up because they were competitors.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ That would certainly make sense.

#### TREXEL

Yes. And, you know, what had happened sometimes, sometimes it just play like that. Sometimes it get play like that.

#### DAVID

You succeeded so much that everyone died.

#### HARTRO

Too good.

#### TREXEL

That's just sometimes how we do.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

You know?

#### DAVID

Yep, yep, ye, yep, yep, yep. Yeppity.

#### TREXEL

Wow, that's, that's powerful stuff. Well, final one, [__HARTRO:__ Oh, great!] final one!

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Fancy that. What happenstance.

#### DAVID

The final one, which as, as Hartro knows, was for the Placaters of Planetary Puzzles...

#### HARTRO

Puzzles.

#### DAVID

And, and they wanted us to help, uh, help them out of a bit of a--

#### TREXEL

David, stop talking.

#### DAVID

What?

#### TREXEL

Hartro, what did they want us to do?

#### HARTRO

Well, I wasn't sure David really remembered there, he looked like--

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ No, I think he knows. Dav-- He-- I, I--

#### HARTRO

--he looked like he was making it up.

#### TREXEL

I think, yeah, I think David should never talk again. Now Hartro--

#### DAVID

No, I think, I think I fell down, and hit my head, and I can't remember anymore. So I'm just, y'know...

#### TREXEL

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I reckon that. Now, Hartro, what's, what's that?

#### HARTRO

Yeah, well those, uh... it's just those planets, you know, they had... they needed... something from you.

#### TREXEL

They sure did! They sure--

#### HARTRO

They really needed it!

#### TREXEL

By howdy, how they needed *something* in particular! Which was...?

#### HARTRO

Really specifically, they needed the answer...

#### TREXEL

Yes. To the question, which was...?

#### HARTRO

Help us...

#### TREXEL

Exactly. They needed help. And we helped them. And how did we do it?

#### DAVID

Yup.

#### HARTRO

You-- You know, it's funny--

#### TREXEL

I do. Yeah, funny.

#### HARTRO

--how you always-- you just don't-- You know what it is, Trexel? You don't like to praise yourself.

#### TREXEL

I'm very humble.

#### HARTRO

You know, you, you often don't like to stand up and go, 'Yeah, I did it.'

#### TREXEL

That's not me.

#### TREXEL

'You know, who did it? I did it.'

#### TREXEL

I just like-- I like, I like the credit to fall where it falls, you know.

#### HARTRO

Yes. You do!

#### TREXEL

The higher path. The nobler cause.

#### HARTRO

If you do something good, like, what you did, [__TREXEL:__ Yeah.] you just, you know, you're happy to just let, you know, you know it's, you know it's been noted. [__TREXEL:__ Yeah.] And that's... enough.

#### TREXEL

It's-- You know what? I live my life by a simple mantra. You do what you do because you can, and you can because you have, and when you have, unlike having not, not only within yourself, but then with other people, the people that make up what you are, are enjoying the time of their lives, which is now, [__DAVID:__ A-an--] and now is the time to be alive, not taking all the credit.

#### DAVID

And that is exactly what *we* said to them, which was so good.

#### TREXEL

Their minds exploded with how good it was. They were like, 'Wow! What, what a saying! So succinct, I'll put it on a mug!' And then they [__HARTRO:__ They... yep.] just paid us millions of credits.

#### DAVID

Yep. Yep. Yes, that's--

#### HARTRO

I just--

#### TREXEL

I just feel so much happier now we've done, now we've just done a little review.

#### HARTRO

Well done.

#### TREXEL

I don't feel the need to go out, and expose everyone's deepest, darkest secrets ending in their deaths anymore.

#### DAVID

Oh! Well, that good.

#### HARTRO

Alright.

#### TREXEL

Y'know, that, that's just me. That's just me in my life.

#### DAVID

Well, what a, what a happy bonus, um--

#### TREXEL

Well, not a bonus, David, because it was the entire point of why we're here. _(getting irate again)_ Un-unless, of course, it wasn't the entire point! And it was a bonus thing! An extra--!

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ No, no, no, no, no! It was entirely the point.

##### [Hartro tries to be placating as well]

#### DAVID

Nope. It was absolutely, a hundred percent, all about you.

#### TREXEL

_(calm)_ Okay.

#### DAVID

Just to ask some, some really frivo-frivolous, trivial questions like, like old, old, stupid David 7 likes to do--

#### TREXEL

Old fripperous David!

#### DAVID

--'cause' he-- 'cause he does get his fancies. David does get David's fancies.

#### TREXEL

The clo-- The 'clone of fancy' we call you! Look at him, there. Fanciful clone!

#### DAVID

Yeah. Oh David, they love to ask just irrelevant, irrelevant Davidly questions.

##### [Trexel sighs]

#### DAVID

So irrelevantly they ask--

#### TREXEL

Humour him, Hartro, humour him.

#### DAVID

Hey, hey Hartro? Did it-- did you, did you get anything else on your mission?

#### HARTRO

Funny, you should ask, because.. I did.

#### DAVID

Oh?

#### HARTRO

I did. This girl did. Yeah, I got another thing. It is a report, a medical, official medical report on--

#### TREXEL

I had it removed, and they said it was fine.

#### HARTRO

What, what?

#### TREXEL

What?

#### HARTRO

What?

#### TREXEL

Sorry, what are you-- What? What report, what medical report are you talking about?

#### HARTRO

This-- Well, funny enough, this medical report is about you Trexel, it's about your... specific clone.

#### TREXEL

_(relieved)_ Oh, about my clone. Okay, that's fine.

#### HARTRO

_(crosstalk)_ It's about your clone.

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ I understand. Phew!

#### HARTRO

_(crosstalk)_ Well, it's about clones, possibly--

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ I, I thought I'd burned the oth-- It's not important. Off you go.

#### HARTRO

Yeah. Uh, basically, uh, it's, it's a report it's called, uh, "Why So Swole?"

#### DAVID

Right?

#### HARTRO

It-- Yeah, it's about clones, and how they are genetically engineered to be incredibly strong. I mean, here, here, have a look...

#### TREXEL

Here, here, let me have a look. __[grabs report]__

#### HARTRO

_(crosstalk)_ Yeah, have, have a read there.

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ You, you read that. Yeah, 'cause it's all about you...

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ Just says-- Not seeing my name anywhere on it...

#### HARTRO

_(crosstalk)_ All about your... clone exper... __[trails off]__

#### TREXEL

But it's not important, it's, it's about, it's about my clone.

#### HARTRO

_(crosstalk)_ It's on there.

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ So, "Why So Swole? A study into the enstrengthening of clones at unexpected rates".

##### [muttered reading noises]

#### TREXEL

And, uh, here we are, here we are...

#### HARTRO

I think it's quite important.

#### TREXEL

"Clone David 7 has exhibited some extremely swole tendencies, ripping through walls, [__DAVID:__ Ah... Mm-hmm.] metal bending..." so-and-so-and-so, ah here we are, here we are, here we are! "In looking into the issue of why we have yet to see, previously, any grand enswolenings of clones, our science dude reckons that is because clones are genetically engineered to grow so quickly that if one were to exercise, the extremely accelerated cells used to make up its body would become very strong, very dense, very quickly. I reckon. Leave me alone. I'm on break." So, I suppose what they're saying here is that all clones *have* the ability to become as frighteningly strong and dense as David, it's just that, why would a clone exercise? When would that ever come up?

#### DAVID

_(pondering)_ Why would a clone exercise? [__HARTRO:__ Hmmm.] Yeah...

#### TREXEL

So, David, you're the first clone to ever exercise.

#### DAVID

_(sotto voce)_ Ah, but maybe not the last.

#### HARTRO

G-give me the evidence back. Cause I'm gonna put that--

#### TREXEL

I just want a, I just want a...

##### [Trexel attempts to devour this report as well, struggling ensues]

#### DAVID

Wait! No, no, no!

#### HARTRO

No! Get it!

##### [Trexel is divested of the report, after another fern is deployed]

#### TREXEL

I'll get it one day.

#### HARTRO

These are quite handy. I might always just keep a fern around, you know? You know, when you don't have a--

#### TREXEL

Well, I mean it's better than the foot. I mean... yeah, yeah.

#### HARTRO

--foot. I has been a long time since a footing...

#### DAVID

Ah! __[burbles at the prospect]__

#### TREXEL

I'd say we're done here! I, I'd say were done David? Would you say we're done?

#### DAVID

Ooh, done, done. Done-dy, done, done.

#### TREXEL

Oh, so done.

#### DAVID

Done, done-dedy...

#### HARTRO

Well, I'll be seeing you...

#### DAVID

Diddly-done.

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### HARTRO

And I think, I think that the, uh, the, the proper information has been received for this week. I think my continuous spying mission shall carry on.

#### TREXEL

Ah, just, uh, tod-tod-toddle off on whatever is your--

#### HARTRO

Yes. Yes. Fern Creature will be leaving now.

#### DAVID

Okay. Yes. Yes. Fern Creature.

#### HARTRO

_(conspiratorially)_ I'm going to go back into it, you know, as I leave. 'Cause I-- 'cause I came in as--

#### TREXEL

_(background)_ Fern Creature... Fern Creature...

#### DAVID

I've already forgotten that Hartro was here.

#### HARTRO

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Good. Yeah. Yes. 'Cause I ca-- I came in, and I need to stick with it, because people will wonder, 'Why it's Hartro is coming out of--

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ We would hate to ruin the illusion.

#### HARTRO

_(softly)_ Activate voice modulator. 

##### [two beeps as it activates]

#### DAVID

Go-- Oh, b-bye Fern Creature! Thank you for the fern, lovely ferns. Same fern time, same fern place. Am I right?

#### FERN CREATURE

And... goodbye.

##### [door whooshes as Fern Creature leaves]

#### TREXEL

That's it David. Let's not be weird about the fern creature. The fern creature has its own things to do. Now, David, I just want you to remember something.

#### DAVID

Yes?

#### TREXEL

Always. Buy. Ferns. They're a great investment.

_(crosstalk)_ In fact, I need to chase down Fern Creature, because I think we can buy a couple more plants.

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ Well, no, actually. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, Trexel, Trexel, take the, take the--

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ Fern Creature! Fern Creature!

##### [door whooshes as Trexel leaves]

#### DAVID

Oh, what am I going to do with all these ferns?!

##### [show theme starts]
