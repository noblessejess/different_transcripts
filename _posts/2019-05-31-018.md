Rusty Quill presents: Stellar Firma.

##### [theme continues]

#### DAVID 

__[sigh]__ Yeah. I knew it. I knew nothing would change. "Friends." We're "friends". Well, ten minutes, not-friend. Or-- __[footsteps approach]__ I just-- Look, I knew this was gonna happen. I knew this was gonna to happen.

#### TREXEL

_(drawn out)_ David.

#### DAVID

Trexel.

#### TREXEL

David 7. There you are. __[soft chuckle]__ I've been looking for you! Where have you been?

#### DAVID

In-- in this, the same room I've always been in.

#### TREXEL

Isn't that just like you, David? Always in the room. Because you can't leave! __[laughs]__

#### DAVID

Yes. Yes, that's very much like me.

#### TREXEL

Not allowed to leave. I know what you're thinking. He said he'd be earlier. And you're right, David! I did say I'd try and be a little bit earlier. I did say that. But the funniest thing happened, David. I was walking along the western terrace, [__DAVID:__ Mm.] and I saw a beautiful pebble. And I thought, "I should get David a gift. He's my friend now. He's a friend of mine. [__DAVID:__ Right.] We're friends." And I thought, "What can a friend get a friend more than a lovely pebble?"

#### DAVID

Being on time.

#### TREXEL

And I dropped that pebble and it fell in a load of other pebbles. And I thought, "Well, I have to find that pebble again." So, I was digging through and thinking, "I've got to do something for David. He's put up with so much from me!" And I thought, "I have to find him that pebble." And I-- I couldn't find it. But I thought, "I'll find a good other pebble."

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

There's a couple of million pebbles on the western promenade so I started sifting through. And-- and then I draw sort of a crowd, and __[laughs]__ I did-- I did throw a couple of pebbles. Security didn't take too kindly to that, so they detained me for a few hours for questioning and light tasering. But, after that, I got out and I thought, "You know what? It's time to go, pebble or no, to David to do some-- some hard-core planet design."

#### DAVID

So, you don't have the pebble?

#### TREXEL

I don't have the pebble. But I do have... this letter I wrote you.

##### [paper rustles]

#### DAVID

Oh.

#### TREXEL

Can I read it out?

#### DAVID 

_(hesitantly)_ Yes?

#### TREXEL

Okay. __[clears throat]__ "From the desk of Trexel Geistman."

#### DAVID

No, no. 'Cause this is your desk. So...

#### TREXEL

Do, do you really want to do--? I've written-- I've written you a lovely letter, David.

#### DAVID

Yes. No, let's listen to the letter.

#### TREXEL 

__[soft paper rustling]__ Right. "From the bedroom of Trexel Geistman. __[sniffs]__ Dear David 7, I'm Trexel Geistman! Hi! ...You know, I've been doing this for many years. Excellently. In fact, I'm really quite respected. In fact, you know what, you're welcome." There you go.

#### DAVID

Thank you. Yes, I'll take that and--

#### TREXEL 

_(crosstalk)_ You can keep that. That-- that's signed by me.

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ Shredding.

##### [shredding noises]

#### TREXEL 

_(crosstalk)_ So, you can pop that on your wall there. Point it out to passersby.

#### DAVID

Right. Yes, um. So, shall we... do the brief?

#### TREXEL

Why not?

#### DAVID

Design a planet?

#### TREXEL

You know? Between friends? Yes. Let's do the brief, David.

#### DAVID

Right. Yes. Okay. Well, good. I'm gonna get it out now, then.

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ Initiating.

#### DAVID

Okay. __[sighs]__ So, this client is Orren Thruul.

#### TREXEL

Orren Thruul.

#### DAVID

They want this planet in order to host the exhibits for their latest intergalactic art show, *Rebirth of the Star Marlin*.

#### TREXEL

*Rebirth of the Star Marlin*? Ah, a sequel! Have you heard of the *Birth of the Star Marlin*?

#### DAVID

No.

#### TREXEL

Oh, wonderful show. A wonderful show. Orren did a-- an amazing job on that one. I didn't go because it sounded like it would be... culture. But I heard a lot of people did go and they were like, "Gosh. That's quite the Star Marlin. Did you see it get born? [__DAVID:__ Okay.] Did you see the birthing sack? Did you see it split? Did you see the Marlin midwives taking it out and cleaning it up?"

#### DAVID

Okay, so, this is a show about...

#### TREXEL

The birthing of the Star Marlin.

#### DAVID

Okay. And, do you know what the *Rebirth of the Star Marlin* is-- is about? I-- I don't know if they've done any previews or anything like that. But, I don't really have *access* to...

#### TREXEL

Well, ch-- What do you-- Check on IMOGEN. You'll get a clip of th-- the original. Just type in the *Birth of the Star Marlin*. It's a *classic*, David, I've heard.

#### DAVID

Okay. Well, right. Let's just have a look here. Okay.

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ Opening holovid: *Birth of the Star Marlin*

##### [calm music, growling, screaming, birthing noises]

#### TREXEL

Ah, there's the Star Marlin. Giving birth.

#### DAVID

Oh.

#### TREXEL

There you are.

#### DAVID

Augh, oh.

#### TREXEL

That's graphic. That's graphic. So much more fluid than you would expect.

#### DAVID

Ooh! Oh. Oh. __[gagging]__

#### TREXEL

Culture. Culture.

#### DAVID

Ugh. I'm going to turn it off. Okay, there-- there we go.

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ That seems about right. Culture.

##### [David takes deep breaths]

#### TREXEL

So, the rebirth I imagine someone's popped it back up and it's coming out again.

#### DAVID

Oh.

#### TREXEL

At a guess! That's what I'd say's happening.

#### DAVID

Right. So, Star Marlins, is that a real... thing?

#### TREXEL

D-- do you want to roll back the tape? That's a Star Marlin.

#### DAVID

Oh, that's actually a--

#### TREXEL

A Star Marlin, they-- they are...

#### DAVID

That's not a prop.

#### TREXEL

They're a benevolent force in-- in the universe. The Star Marlin is a symbol of hope and-- and-- and, um, purity in the galaxy. Like a fine chilled glass of vodka. It sits there, pure, unblemished. That's the Star Marlin.

#### DAVID

Okay, that Star Marlin looked pretty blemished to me and what it was doing was not pure.

#### TREXEL

Birth is beautiful, David. Birth is beautiful. Remember when you were born? How was that?

#### DAVID

Awful.

#### TREXEL

Okay, maybe a bad example because you're a clone and your birthing process was a little bit awful. But-- but real people birth and real Marlin birth is a *beautiful* thing, a-- a time for bonding, a time for coming together, a time to be *covered* in amniotic fluid!

#### DAVID

Okay. Right. Well, what they want is something for this *Rebirth* [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] *of the Star Marlin* to host the exhibits... for the latest intergalactic art show? So... there are exhibits?

#### TREXEL

Yes. Of course. Of course. This Star Marlin's been alive for a while. It's being reborn, sure. But you need the accoutrement of a Star Marlin life well lived.

#### DAVID

Right, so this was sort of a-- a-- a walking show where you-- you wend your way through [__TREXEL:__ Yes, wend your way.] the various artifacts of the Star Marlin [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] and then the pièce de résistance [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] was watching... *that*.

#### TREXEL

The *Rebirth of the Star Marlin*.

#### DAVID

Right. Okay, well, what they *absolutely* must have, [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] umm, is excellent lighting.

#### TREXEL

Well, of course. If you can't see the Star Marlin being born, w-- w-- what-- what's the-- what's the point of going to the __[laughs]__ *Rebirth of the Star Marlin* show.

#### DAVID

Hmm.

#### TREXEL

"Oh, look. I-- I-- I'm looking at the, at the artifacts that have-- have made up the life of one of the beautiful creatures that are Star Marlins. Oh, no. It's entirely dark." _(yells)_ *Are you a moron, David?!*

#### DAVID

What? No. I-- This is-- That's the nonnegotiable feature, so, they thought that it was necessary to specify that, so...

#### TREXEL

Fine. Fine. Fine. Well, you know, sometimes artists *are* a little flighty. "Oh, I need light. Oh, oxygen please." Demanding people.

#### DAVID

Right. Um, so, this is a-- I-- I'm assuming this is... like, the same sort of format as, as the previous one so...

#### TREXEL

No no no no no, David. No no no no, David. David, David, David. Silly, stupid David. Quiet. Shh, shush, quiet David. Quiet. I'm just going to press my hand up against your face.

#### DAVID

Mm.

#### TREXEL

Stupid-- __[laughs]__ stupid, beautiful David. Shut your face. Shut it. Shut that hole.

##### [beat]

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ Prolonged clone-consultant contact. Security alerted.

#### DAVID

Mm-hmm.

#### TREXEL

The first birth of the Star Marlin, as the name suggests, was the *first* birth of the Star Marlin. What exhibits are you gonna have? "My first day in the womb." "My 400th day in the womb." Wombs are pretty similar. It's just a gently growing egg that then gets, like, a-- arms and a face. You know, th-- there's not much to go in there. That's maybe, like, one wall of an exhibit. So, with that one, it was like, "Hello. Sit down. Bam! Birth of a Star Marlin. [__DAVID:__ Right.] One showing. Get out. Buy some candy floss." You know, that real first effort.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

This, this is a more mature show. A more mature showing. Now it's about the *journey* of the Star Marlin. You can't be reborn unless there's something you're being reborn *from*. So many hopes! "Ah, a Sta--" Role play, David. Role play. We need to do some role play. We need to do some role play. Role play, role play.

#### DAVID

Uh, okay. Right. Yes.

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ Roleplay holovision initiated.

##### [electronic powering on sound]

#### TREXEL

You're a-- you're a newly born Star Marlin.

#### DAVID

Um. __[purring]__

#### TREXEL

You've got it! You've got it. That's exactly how a Star Marlin sounds. You are a universal symbol of peace and prosperity. Everything that you do is watched, like-- like a hawk.

#### DAVID 

__[purring, but with an uptick, like a noise of confusion]__

#### TREXEL

Will you unite two people or will your ignorance of their plight cause a war? I-- it's all possible. You're a Star Marlin. You're a symbol for everything that is good and hopeful.

#### DAVID 

_(starting to panic)_ Oh. Oh! Oh, this is a lot of pressure.

#### TREXEL

Exactly. And your failure will directly hurt people.

#### DAVID

Oh!

#### TREXEL

Now, imagine you're in a world with information superhighways crisscrossing this way and that. Everybody watching your every move. Every planet. __[David panicking more]__ Billions upon billions of beings looking at you every day.

#### DAVID

No. No!

#### TREXEL

"Look to the Star Marlin."

#### DAVID

That's too much! That's too much!

#### TREXEL

"Help us. Save us!"

#### DAVID

No. I can't! I can't!

#### TREXEL

_(yelling)_ "Save us!"

#### DAVID

_(panicking)_ I can't! I can't! Aahh! Ah!

#### TREXEL

Wanna be reborn?

#### DAVID

Aahh, umm..

#### TREXEL

Want it to start anew?

#### DAVID

Uhh...

#### TREXEL

Want a fresh start?

#### DAVID

Ahhhh, are people going to look at me less?

#### TREXEL

Maybe. Who knows?

#### DAVID

Um. Can I be reborn not as a Star Marlin?

#### TREXEL

It's the *Rebirth of the Star Marlin*, David. You can't be born as something else.

#### DAVID

Okay, well, if I'm gonna be reborn, could I... maybe be a less pressured Star Marlin?

#### TREXEL

Perhaps. Only you can write that story, Star Marlin David. "Only you as we follow the *Rebirth of the Star Marlin*."

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ Roleplay holovision terminated.

##### [electronic powering off sound]

#### TREXEL

Do you see?

#### DAVID

Wha-- n-- no! 'Cause I-- I didn't write the show. I didn't make the show, so I don't know-- like, I felt like that when you described [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] being a Star Marlin to me. But we can't assume that that's how Orren Thruul will approach this kind of thing. Art is subjective.

#### TREXEL

You can't-- you can't assume? David, all I do is assume! Every single day. Assume this. Assume that. Never ask anyone their opinion!

#### DAVID

Maybe that's the problem.

#### TREXEL

...The problem?

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

...David. That's a good point. Okay. I won't assume.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

What do we do?

#### DAVID

Ah.

#### TREXEL

Ah-ha ha! I have caught you. In a logical trap. If I don't assume, how can I create? If I'm waiting on everybody for their input-- "Oh, I won't-- I won't make this mountain explode every Thursday because I'm waiting for the input from the client." "Oh, maybe they want nitrogen in the atmosphere but I've used ammonia. Maybe I shouldn't have done that." I'm not going to wait around for some pencil-necked, pencil pusher to pencil me into their pencil book for a pencil meeting, am I?!

#### DAVID

Okay. Okay.

#### TREXEL

Am I! Am I?

#### DAVID

No.

#### TREXEL

Have I done that?

#### DAVID

No.

#### TREXEL

Exactly.

#### DAVID

Okay. Well-- so-- o-- okay. Well, in which case, maybe in the past your assumptions have been slightly wide of the mark.

#### TREXEL

Mm-hmm.

#### DAVID

Hence the reaction and feedback we've had and the deaths you've caused on most planets.

#### TREXEL

Almost certainly.

#### DAVID

So... what would you assume [__TREXEL:__ Mm-hmm.] about the *Rebirth of the Star Marlin*?

#### TREXEL

Fluids.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

You need to waterproof the room.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

This is gonna be a fluid affair. Sloshing gallons of amniotic sac fluids.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

Everywhere!

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

You don't wanna keep any books on the floor, they'll be ruined.

#### DAVID

O--

#### TREXEL

Got any old antique furniture? Keep it off the floor!

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

It'll be covered in birth fluid.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

So, we need a tank. In fact, let's make a pit. Tanks are easier than pits. Right. An entirely waterproof world. Water can't even touch its surface. It just springs off.

#### DAVID

Ah-- oh-- hmm. Okay. How are they going to drink?

#### TREXEL

They don't. It's an art exhibit. Keep them thirsty. Keep 'em off balance. Keep 'em off kilter. This is a hostile world because *art* isn't your *friend*.

#### DAVID

How long was the *Birth of the Star Marlin*?

#### TREXEL

Twenty-nine hours.

#### DAVID

Okay, and sequels are usually longer.

#### TREXEL

Sixty-four hours.

#### DAVID

Okay. So... we're gonna have people not drinking anything for sixty-four hours?

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

Now, remember what I said about your assumptions? So let's do the opposite of that. Right?

#### TREXEL

Okay. Fluid everywhere!

#### DAVID

No.

#### TREXEL

Everybody's drowning!

#### DAVID

What? No!

#### TREXEL

You know-- in fact, everybody turns up to a-- an entire water world. You tie a lead weight to their foot. It's freshwater, though. _(yells)_ *Drink as much as you want! Are you happy now?!* [__DAVID:__ No, that's just--] *You've got water!*

#### DAVID

No, that just murders people.

#### TREXEL

But that's the exact opposite of what I said.

#### DAVID

No, it's not.

#### TREXEL

Is it not?

#### DAVID

No! Where did the lead come from? Where did the drowning come from?

#### TREXEL

You've got to get them in the water.

#### DAVID

No, you don't have to get them in the water.

#### TREXEL

You really get them in it, man.

#### DAVID

You just said that it was-- you need to be a waterproof room 'cause there's going to be a lot of water! All I'm going to assume now is that the *Rebirth of the Star Marlin* is a particularly dry affair!

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### DAVID

Should take place on a mountain.

#### TREXEL

Fine.

#### DAVID

Actually, what's the-- the habitat of a Star Marlin? I assume it's the void of space.

#### TREXEL

It is indeed the void of space. They-- they glide through the void of space dispensing justice and wisdom hither and yon.

#### DAVID

Okay, so why do you think it's so wet?

#### TREXEL

In space?

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Have you been in space? Have you been in the vacuum of space, David? Look in my eyes. Tell me. Are you a vacuum of space man?

#### DAVID

No.

#### TREXEL

Are you a vacuum man?

#### DAVID

No?

#### TREXEL

Are you a v-man?

#### DAVID

I-- No?

#### TREXEL

In which case I vehemently say, you know nothing of space. And neither do I. So, *who's* to say, David? Water is a fluid. And gas can act like a fluid. So, in the vacuum of space where there's no gas, then why wouldn't it act like a fluid as much as a fluid would. Do you follow? Do you follow? It's-- it's a logical progression, David. Gases can be like fluids. Fluids can be like gases. There isn't any gas or fluid in space. So, maybe the space is a fluid gas. Maybe it's a fluid gaseous fluid flow flowing flowidly through the flow-flow.

#### DAVID

Okay, I think we've got a bit too hung up on the Star Marlin thing.

#### TREXEL

What is gas?!

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ Gas: a gaseous substance.

#### DAVID

Right. It's-- it's a show. It's an art show.

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

Okay. So, wha-- what do you need for art show? And they want good lighting, okay?

#### TREXEL

Ah.

#### DAVID

Which implies maybe they-- they need the things that shows *normally need*.

#### TREXEL

The light *is* the show.

#### DAVID

No. Th-- the show is the *Rebirth of the Star Marlin*.

#### TREXEL

No. David, shut up! The light is the show. You have a lamp. You have an uplighter. Au contraire, sir. That's merely a way of saying "I have been defeated by a system that I hate. Oh, oh, I'm showing art that is supposed to-- to *challenge* the patriarchy and challenge the preconceptions of your universe but I'm using a lamp. What is a lamp other than an expression of-- of-- of *control*. Down with the lamp! Up with the imprisoned sun!" You lasso a sun out of the sky. We don't make one, David. We steal one. We thieve a sun away from a solar system, *casting* it into everlasting darkness.

#### DAVID

What?

#### TREXEL

And you imprison the sun in an orb. And around that orb, you channel mirrors. And then, you channel the mirror-- the mirror orb. _(voice gets louder and louder)_ A whole trumpet into the room in which you're lighting. And is lit with a thousand lumen light of a stolen sun! And *there* is your *art*!

#### DAVID

Okay. Two things. How many lumens do you think is in a sun?

#### TREXEL

I-- uhh--

#### DAVID

A lot more than a thousand.

#### TREXEL

Is it more than a thousand?

#### DAVID

Yes! Second, right, how do you think solar systems work? You can't just take the sun out of them. They're not just dark. They-- they-- they--

#### TREXEL

But that's, that-- that's art, David.

#### DAVID

No, you've just killed, like, billions of people.

#### TREXEL

No! We'll-- we'll only need it for a weekend. We'll put it back later.

#### DAVID

But the solar system's gone by then.

#### TREXEL

Really?

#### DAVID

Yes!

#### TREXEL

W-w-well, won't it all just sort of hold in place until we put it back?

#### DAVID

No, the sun's what holds it in place!

#### TREXEL

Gravity! Of course! I've got-- Well, thank goodness you were here, David. I was this close to stealing *plenty* of suns.

#### DAVID

Well, look.

#### TREXEL

That's how my last four wars started, so...

#### DAVID

__[sighs]__ Look, the-- the idea of the imprisoned sun is quite interesting.

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

They want excellent lighting.

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

The sun is an excellent way to make light.

#### TREXEL

And the imprisonment of it is such a comment on the fact that you've imprisoned a sun!

#### DAVID

Okay, no. Okay, look, Trexel. It mi-- It sounds like maybe you have some bunched up creativity that needs an outlet. Okay?

#### TREXEL

Yes. And I just want to help, David. You understand. I just want to help.

#### DAVID

Maybe-- maybe you should go write a play in your own time.

#### TREXEL

I actually have a-- a small manuscript here, if you'd like. __[papers rustle]__

#### DAVID

Okay, no-- Not, not--

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ Prose detected. Security alerted.

#### DAVID

Trexel.

#### TREXEL

_(reading manuscript)_ We open on a summer's day. Earth 3.6. The Kreluvean Era. Capaltan Dag watches over--

#### DAVID

Okay, scene. Okay, scene. Right. We can't do this now. We have a planet to design.

#### TREXEL

Yes. Of course. Of course. Of course, David.

#### DAVID

And the show is the *Rebirth of the Star Marlin--*

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

--by Orren Thruul.

#### TREXEL

Okay, well--

#### DAVID

Not whatever that was by Trexel Geistman.

#### TREXEL

What have we got so far?

##### [beat]

#### DAVID

Nothing!

#### TREXEL

Nothing? Surely not. Surely--

#### DAVID

No, we've got... an imprisoned sun?

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

But nothing else.

#### TREXEL

Okay. Well, we've-- we've-- we got-- we've got four or so minutes left. Okay, le-- let's back to basics. Strip it back. Strip it back. Strip it back. Nothingness.

#### DAVID

No!

#### TREXEL

No atoms at all.

#### DAVID

No. Okay--

#### TREXEL

We start physics from the word go.

#### DAVID

Right, we--

#### TREXEL

Right, first physical law, David. Give me a physical law.

#### DAVID

No, we're not doing-- We have to make a planet!

#### TREXEL

Well, you don't want to do-- to be too complicated. I strip it back and that's too simp--

#### DAVID

Okay, you stripped it back too far. Can we please just start *with* a planet.

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### DAVID

A ball, right? What's the environment of this planet?

#### TREXEL

Non-Newtonian.

#### DAVID

A: that's not an environment, and B: it makes no sense.

#### TREXEL 

__[whimpers]__ Well... I don't know what you want from me, David.

#### DAVID

Can we just have a ball? They want to put on an art show, right?

#### TREXEL

Yes. Yes.

#### DAVID

They just want a nice place to put on an art show.

#### TREXEL

_(quiet)_ Alright, fine.

#### DAVID

Somewhere fancy.

#### TREXEL 

_(quiet)_ Okay, fine.

#### DAVID

So they can have their clientele there.

#### TREXEL

Okay, that's fine.

#### DAVID

With good lighting!

#### TREXEL

I'm saying it's fine. Everything's fine. We're having a lot of fun. And everything's fine. Okay. You want a little planet. Just a little dinky, short-use planet for a little art show to be on it.

#### DAVID

It doesn't even have to be short-use. Just has to be a planet where you can put on an art show.

#### TREXEL

W-- w-- w-- what you just want it to be sitting around after the show's done sixty-four hours? We put a time bomb in the middle of the planet.

#### DAVID

No! Wha-- No. They've paid for the planet, they can *keep* it.

#### TREXEL

Fine, if you want to be really reductive about it, David. I didn't realise you were such a square.

#### DAVID 

_(crosstalk)_ That's not what reductive means!

#### TREXEL

You're a reductive square. Look at that square reducing. I can barely see it anymore. Oh, it's just a pixel. A pixel on a screen. A tiny--

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ Wha-- Ok, I'm a... really tiny square that wants to design a good planet!

#### TREXEL

David, I've upset you. And for that, you are sorry. But we have to agree on something, David. We haven't got that much long left.

#### DAVID

Okay. You saw some stuff about the *Birth of the Star Marlin*, right?

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

Apart from that *horrible* video you showed me, [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] is that pretty much everything you know about the Star Marlin?

#### TREXEL

Almost absolutely. I didn't even go to that show.

#### DAVID

Okay. Well, if it's still a birth, then it should look like maybe a place where a birth should happen. Maybe some sort of operating theater. They're going to need a big building, [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] for this show. [__TREXEL:__ Okay.] Maybe it should look like a big hospital.

#### TREXEL

And every single member of staff of the hospital is _(yells)_ *a captured imprisoned sun*!

#### DAVID

What?

#### TREXEL

_(yells)_ Forced into labour against their needs and wills! "I don't want to operate on this lady. I haven't got arms. I'm just an orb under high pressure!"

#### DAVID

No... stop. Assumedly, Orren Thruul will bring their own staff members!

#### TREXEL

So, you don't want all the staff to be imprisoned suns.

#### DAVID

No!

#### TREXEL

What about coerced moons?

#### DAVID

That doesn't-- You've-- you've just made that up.

#### TREXEL

A blackmailed comet!

#### DAVID

That's not even a thing!

#### TREXEL

Okay. Well, you obviously haven't lived, David. I've blackmailed a comet or two in my time.

#### DAVID

Well, I don't think they're going to be very--

#### TREXEL

"I've got pictures of your icy tails so you better do what I say."

#### DAVID

Okay. I... just don't think they're going to be very useful staffing an *art show*.

#### TREXEL

Alright. Tell you what, David. There's such a thing as a hospital cube.

#### DAVID

Right. What's one of those?

#### TREXEL

It's a big cube which is pretty much automatically kitted out to be a hospital.

#### DAVID

Brilliant.

#### TREXEL

How about we just use one of them, put a time bomb in the middle, [__DAVID:__ Okay, no-- Look--] staff it with suns, orbit it around a moon that's actually as big as a sun so it gently becomes a sun as it orbits around!

#### DAVID

_(done with this)_ Actually, yes. No. Fine Trexel.

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

These are all *brilliant* ideas.

#### TREXEL

Thank you.

#### DAVID

I'm just writing them *all* down in the brief and look.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Would you like to submit?

#### DAVID 

_(crosstalk)_ We've not got much time left so you've nailed it again.

#### TREXEL

Nailed it again.

#### DAVID

Off it goes!

##### [chime, pneumatic tube hissing, clunk]

#### IMOGEN

Submitting.

#### TREXEL

There it goes! Ah. Wonderful! Wonderful!

#### DAVID

Yes. Brilliant. So--

#### TREXEL

You know, we work better as friends, David. We work better as friends because, you know, I-- I'm going to admit that, previously, I've been a little incalcitrant in my approach to the design process. My way or the highway. But this more collaborative approach, David, you know, as friends, as-- I'm not going to say equals because I'm *absolutely* not your equal! I'm above you in *every* single way conceivable! But, beyond that, it's a much nicer way of working, don't you think?

#### DAVID

Yes. It was... beautifully relaxing. Now, I'm sure you have a lot of... things to be getting on with.

#### TREXEL

No. I just want to bond, David. How 'bout we talk about you? How are you feeling, David?

#### DAVID

Uhh...

#### TREXEL

You can tell old Trexel.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

You can tell Uncle Trexel.

#### DAVID

Well--

#### TREXEL

I may be your boss, David, but I'm also your friend who's your boss.

#### DAVID

Well, maybe. I mean, I was really interested in... the, umm, script you were writing so-- But-- but I thought that-- that maybe the first draft's a little rough. Uh, maybe you wanna go away and-- and-- and workshop that and then-- and then you can--

#### TREXEL

But you-- but you think there's potential there?

#### DAVID

Oh, no, absolutely. Yes, I think you should probably go work on it right now.

#### TREXEL

Would you like me to do the-- the-- I have a character treatment for-- for a character I call Dominic Quailface. Would you like to-- to read that very quickly?

#### DAVID

Oh, no, no. I'm sure it's really, really good. [__TREXEL:__ No. Okay, you--] So you should probably just, uh, maybe, go and write him in more. He sounds so... very, uh, compelling.

#### TREXEL 

_(chuckling)_ Well, he's one of the Quailface Nine so I would hope so, David.

#### DAVID

Okay. Well, why not Quailface Ten?

##### [beat]

#### TREXEL

Quailface Ten, you say?

#### DAVID

Yes. Oh, you-- Yes. Why don't you, uh, go--

#### TREXEL 

_(excited)_ Yes, of course. That's what's been missing from the Sixteenth Act!

#### DAVID

Okay, so, off you go. Off you go. Off you go. Yes.

#### TREXEL 

_(crosstalk)_ There's only nine Quailfaces so we-- Maybe there was a Quailface that would-- Yes, of course! Th-- thank you, David! Thank you!

##### [door swooshes closed]

#### DAVID

__[sighs]__ Right.

##### [brief is pulled from the tube, whoosh from vacuum being unsealed, pneumatic tube door closes]

#### DAVID

Now I can get some proper work done.
