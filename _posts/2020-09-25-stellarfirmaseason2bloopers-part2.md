Hello, and welcome to part 2 of the Stellar Firma season 2 bloopers, because we know that if nothing else, our fans are gluttons for the punishment that is our consistent and abject failure. Look, th-this feels negative. They're fun! They're bloopers! Supposed to be fun. Enjoy them! Don't cry. Stop crying! <a id="footnote-1-ref" href="#footnote-1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>

"I've got-- I've got two--"

#### JENNY 

_(as Hartro as Ortrah)_ "Chauncey, you present your elaborate, uh, portrayal in front of Big John John and he falls over dead __[Ben snorts, Tim laughs]__ with surprise!"

#### TIM

_(laughing)_ What's that--

#### BEN

_(laughing)_ Sorry-- __[breaks into laughter]__

#### TIM

Sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. __[laughs]__

#### BEN

Didn't expect to go there! But it did.

#### TIM

_(laughing)_ Okay. __[laughs]__

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

_(as Trexel)_ "I sidle up to her and say, 'Hey there, chicken. Want to dance?' What-- what skill do I use for that?"

#### BEN

"You didn't use your voice."

#### TIM

"Sorry--"

#### JENNY

"And remember--"

#### TIM

_(trying to do Trexel as Chauncey, interrupting)_ "Hey there, chicken." [__JENNY:__ Your--] _(as Trexel)_ "What? That's not the voice." __[laughs, Jenny chuckles]__

#### BEN

_(sounding like Elvis)_ Well, hey there, chicken. __[chuckles]__

#### TIM

Sorry. Sorry.

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

Shall we just have it so like-- 'Well, okay, so we fail. What happens now?' 'I think you know what happens, Trexel.'

#### JENNY

Okay.

#### TIM

And then you put the foot in.

#### JENNY

Alright.

##### [Ben laughs]

#### JENNY

Just-- This is proof that it's-- the foot is not all me!

#### BEN

Wait! Sh-**[bleep]**! Tim, we've been rumbled!

#### TIM

We've been-- __[laughs]__

#### JENNY

This is proof!

#### TIM

Look, no no no--

#### BEN

You introduced it!

##### [Jenny chuckles]

#### TIM

You introduced it. We're not saying--

#### JENNY

You want the foot. [__BEN:__ Oh, we-- Oh!] You keep asking for the foot.

#### BEN

Look--

#### TIM

Okay. Okay, okay. We've never denied--

##### [Jenny laughs softly in the background]

#### BEN

This has now been recorded. Jenny just said, 'You want the foot'.

#### TIM

You want the foot. Somebody--

#### BEN

And that, that is on audio.

#### TIM

Somebody cut that out for __[Jenny sighs]__ something unsavory. __[chuckles]__

#### JENNY

Okay. Okay.

#### TIM

You want the foot. Right. Okay.

#### JENNY

_(crosstalk)_ Alright. So...

#### BEN

Some sort of musical remix.

#### TIM

Yes. _(mimicking EDM style)_ ♪ You you-- ♫

♪ You want the foot. ♫

#### BEN

♪ You want the foot. ♫

##### [transition beep]

#### BEN

"Pooping!"

#### TIM

"H-- What?"

#### BEN

"I was pooping."

#### TIM

"I don't think we're having that Ben." __[laughs]__

#### BEN

"Why not?"

#### TIM

"Pooping in the corner?"

#### BEN

"Why not?"

#### TIM

"Really?"

#### BEN

I have my pod! __[Tim laughs]__ I have a toilet. It's been explicitly established. Why does he just neg me?

#### TIM

I don't-- __[breaks into laughter]__

#### BEN

Honestly, yes and. Yes and!

#### TIM

_(laughing)_ I don't-- I don't like the pooping.

#### BEN

I said poop. I'm not actually pooping, Tim!

#### TIM

It made me uncomfortable.

#### BEN

This is not gonna become poo play!

------

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

I was almost gonna stop you and say, 'Why not put on an Out of Office?' __[laughs, Ben joins in]__ *(sounding like a recording)* "'I'm sorry, David 7 cannot be reached at this time!' __[Ben laughs loudly]__ Correct, David." __[Ben continues laughing]__

#### BEN

"You might very well say that. I couldn't possibly comment!"

#### TIM

Right. Okay. Cool. That's good. Um--

------

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

"The Trexel Geistman 10 Steps to Sales Success Program!"

#### BEN

"Oh, yes--"

#### TIM

"That's not its name! That's not its name!" __[Ben laughs]__ Trexel Geist--

#### BEN

It only has the name 'Domination' in there somewhere but yeah.

#### TIM

Trexel Geistman 10 Steps to Sales Domination. __[Ben laughs]__ Right.

#### BEN

It says something about your character that I was like, 'This could absolutely be in the edit.'

#### TIM

Okay. Give me a mo'. Right.

------

##### [transition beep]

##### [hand clap marker]

#### TIM

Just-- Why do I clap?! I ca-- I haven't thought of anything yet! I was just like, 'Tim start.' __[Ben laughs]__ Wawoowoowoo.

#### BEN

'Tim, I wasn't ready. Why did you do this to me, Tim?'

#### TIM

'Hang on. I'll think of something at the end of this clap. __[hand clap marker]__ Eh, that didn't work.' __[Ben laughs]__ Uhh... Right.

#### BEN

Well, to be fair, it's the improv way.

------

##### [transition beep]

#### BEN

"Are you human?"

#### TIM

_(on the verge of having an existential crisis)_ "Am I human?"

#### BEN

"Or are you dancer?"

#### TIM

"Is it-- Da, f-**[bleep]** off."

#### BEN

That's-- __[breaks into laughter]__

#### TIM

I was about-- I was about to have an existential moment and you made a Coldplay reference.

#### BEN

Ha ha! It's The Killers.

#### TIM

Is it Killers?

#### BEN

Yeah.

#### TIM

Basically, it's the same thing at this stage.

#### BEN

_(crosstalk)_ Specifically, B-- Ay!

#### TIM

Ay? Take that.

#### BEN

Also, might be Brandon Flowers's solo album.

------

##### [transition beep]

#### BEN

"Trexel, check your passlock!"

#### TIM

"Ah, oh! My what?" __[snickers]__

#### BEN

"Passlock."

#### TIM

"My passlock?"

#### BEN

"Yes, because passports are because you can pass through ports, and we have airlocks so you can pass through airlocks."

#### TIM

"Oh, I apologise!"

#### BEN

"I'm world building here!"

#### TIM

"I apologise!"

#### BEN

"It's really good!"

#### TIM

It's really good--

#### BEN

"It's a deep cut--"

#### TIM

It's a deep-- __[chuckles]__

#### BEN

"--but I'm very proud of it."

#### TIM

Okay. Look--

#### BEN

"I realise without context... __[chuckles]__ But once I've explained it, it makes a whole bunch of sense."

#### TIM

Okay. Okay. Okay.

------

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

_(yelling)_ "And we were-- Oh, _(chuckling)_ hello Agent! Oh, I... Oh, ho ho! I hadn't thought of anything to say!"

------

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

_(from farther away)_ "If you can't find a t-**[bleep]**-y bar, David, you make a t-**[bleep]**-y bar! __[Ben laughs]__ Yes, we are recording now. __[Ben continues to laugh]__ And that was to you, David!"

#### BEN

Yes!

#### TIM

"David in the editing booth."

#### BEN

Oh god, did you start?

#### TIM

"I did."

#### BEN

Oh, no.

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

Lucy. Alright.

#### BEN

Lucy. Lucy. _(singing like Trexel)_ ♪ Graph friend. Lucy, the graph friend. __[Tim mimics what Ben says]__ The better graph friend that you ever had. ♫ __[Tim laughs]__ I'm not very good at this.

#### TIM

_(sarcastic)_ Oh, yeah. And I'm a f-**[bleep]**-ing king.

#### BEN

Well...

#### TIM

_(singing)_ ♪ Oh, everything has this tune! Have you noticed everything has this tune because iiii-it's the tune I like to do! ♫

#### BEN

__[laughs]__ Well, you sell it well.

------

##### [transition beep]

#### BEN

_(laughing)_ You can't do this!

#### TIM

Sorry. I'm so sorry. I actually didn't mean to do that. __[Ben laughs]__ Okay. Ready. Okay, ready. Ready. I'm... not having fun. Nobody's having fun. __[Ben snickers]__ You're not having fun.

#### BEN

You're doing it still!

#### TIM

No one's having fun.

#### BEN

St-- Shut up. Stop moving, looking at me, or _(laughing)_ talking.

------

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

"A ruthless obfuscator. Who could love a ruthless obthasca--" oh blah blah blah. __[mouth noises]__

Something snarky about how this reflects on Trexel.

#### TIM

Yeah. __[snickers]__ You've-- you've learned our format.

#### BEN

Yeah.

------

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

...Meh. 

##### [Ben and Tim both break into snickers]

#### BEN

Yeah, you had nothing did you?

#### TIM 

_(laughing)_ Don't ask me questions, give me suggestions.

#### BEN 

_(triumphantly)_ Oh?

"Close enough. Good, okay. Keep doing tens."

#### TIM

"Ten for Tim."

#### BEN

"Kee--"

F-**[bleep]** me.

I guess that is your name. But keep--

Just definitely keep doing tens.

__[scat sings]__ Babedo-bawow.

------

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

"Try that one more time, and I will push your face through a table." __[Ben snorts and then laughs]__ Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

#### BEN

Maybe a bit-- a bit direct threat of violence.

#### TIM

I will push *my* face through this table.

Push my face through your fac-- __[breaks into laughter]__

"Laugh in your face and ask you to leave, so um--" __[Ben coughs]__

#### BEN 

_(hoarse)_ Terribly sorry. __[coughs some more and sniffs]__

##### [transition beep]

#### BEN

"After that line, I'm all ready to put up with *him."*

"Sh-**[bleep]**. But just good morning anyway!"

#### BEN

"Oh. Thanks Hartro!" __[chuckles]__

#### JENNY

So much for a nice clean-- clean cut for--

Don't worry, David. This is-- these--

_(crosstalk)_ No, this is genuine stuff. This isn't us f-**[bleep]**-ing about. This is--

#### TIM

Although, there was that one-- Okay. Right, ready?

------

##### [transition beep]

##### [Ben makes panicked David noises]

#### JENNY

"Uh, below your feet you will see, __[soft thumping noise]__ uh, six--"

#### TIM

"You will see a man kicking a desk." __[Jenny laughs]__ A man kicking a desk.

#### BEN

I got too into it!

#### JENNY

Ooh, ooh! __[laughs]__

#### BEN

I got too into it. I put my knee up and then I-- I bumped the desk. I'm sorry.

Okay, so uh-- At your feet. Then what is six-- yeah.

##### [transition beep]

#### BEN

"Well, as-- I'm-- I'm glad those nipples are going away but honestly this is a terrible idea and you shouldn't do it."

#### BEN

What on Earth...?

#### TIM

"I don't know." __[laughs]__

------

##### [transition beep]

#### BEN

Yeah. __[Tim and Jenny laugh in the background]__ Yeah, David, if you make a gull of us, I really won't blame you.

#### TIM

And I will get on a train and come to Scotland and go through it just to show I care.

#### BEN

They've got good escape rooms in Scotland.

#### TIM

I-- Are they known for it?

#### BEN

No, I think just Edinburgh and Glasgow are very good for it.

#### TIM

Okay.

#### BEN

But not known-- Anyway, this is-- __[Tim chuckles]__ Now I'm doing the-- I'm sorry David. It's his influence.

"I can't believe-- I cannot work under these conditions!"

Well, luckily these conditions are 'you're a prisoner, on a-- in space' so--

#### BEN

"--or normally--"

#### TIM

"And I feel like it's brought us closer together in that we were compacted close to each other in a tube."

#### BEN

"Yeah. Physically, yes; emotionally, I am still very distant from you, thank goodness. So, um--"

#### TIM

Whoa, hey. Subtext, buddy! __[laughs]__

#### BEN 

_(half-laughing)_ "What-- what's a subtext?"

#### TIM 

_(sings)_ ♪ "I am the subtext narrator. To-da-too-too, to-da-too-too." ♫ _(laughing)_ We just do texting.

#### BEN \

_(crosstalk)_ "What is a subtext? What is subtext? I don't understand at all. Text or nothing!"

#### TIM

"I'll just say this, sotto voce." I don't know why I'm criticising you. I do it and it's a good way of doing things but in the-- __[chuckles]__

#### TIM

"The DA is-- the DA."

#### TIM

"Dartro Diltz." __[Ben snorts, Tim laughs]__ No? Okay.

#### BEN

No, that's good. But it's just very stupid. __[laughs]__ Dartro Diltz. __[continues laughing]__

#### TIM

I'll speak the name again.

#### BEN

It's a funny name.

------

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

Right, we're back in the room.

#### BEN 

_(deep sultry voice)_ Hello.

#### TIM

Okay.

#### BEN 

_(deep sultry voice)_ Why couldn't I just have this voice? __[Tim laughs]__ Everything's so stressful when you're with--

#### TIM 

_(deep sultry voice)_ Hi, we're two very soft characters.

#### BEN 

_(deep sultry voice)_ I'm just going to have a very calm discussion about things.

#### TIM 

_(deep sultry voice)_ This is a podcast about lemon tea. __[moaning]__ Mm. Lemon tea.

#### BEN 

_(deep sultry voice)_ Okay. That's-- he's made it weirdly sexual.

#### TIM 

_(deep sultry voice)_ Mm, I've drunk lemony-- __[continues to make moaning noises while Ben talks]__

#### BEN 

_(deep sultry voice)_ Why would you ever say--

#### TIM 

_(deep sultry voice)_ Oh lord.

#### BEN 

_(deep sultry voice)_ Okay, you can never put-- 'mm' with-- __[Tim laughs]__ See? See what I mean?

#### TIM

_(deep sultry voice)_ Oh, you mean to engage in wound management? Mm-hmm.

#### BEN

Mm-hmm.

#### TIM 

_(deep sultry voice)_ Hmm. __[laughs]__ *(normal voice)* Right, okay.

#### BEN 

__[laughs]__ I keep forgetting that we are not doing this just to ourselves.

#### TIM

Yeah.

#### BEN

I am so sorry, Maddy.

#### TIM

Sorry about-- _(sudden realisation)_ Oh god, no! __[Ben laughs]__ Oh, I'm sorry! Ohh, Maddy, I'm so sorry. We're sorry. Please contact HR for the crimes.

##### [transition beep]

#### BEN

"I'm gonna regret this. Trexel?"

#### TIM

"Yes?"

#### BEN

"You're a PI."

#### TIM

"I am."

#### BEN

"What does PI stand for?"

#### TIM

"...Personal... Idea person. ...I'd like another go at that, please. __[Ben giggles]__ What's funnier? He's a private investigator, but what's funnier than that?"

#### TIM

"I'm not good at this!"

#### BEN

"You have loads! You have loads! You have your own office! You've got your name! You can go outside! You can go to the Astral Bar! You can do so many things, and you're just sad because now you're in a f-**[bleep]**-ing--"

#### TIM

__[Ben laughs loudly while Tim talks]__ Alright, alright, Jesus! Alright. F-**[bleep]**-in' hell. _(weird voice)_ A bit of the art has crept out in the character there.

#### BEN

Yeah, apparently I'm-- I'm really-- Tim, I'm really jealous of all of your ability to go to bars and whatever.

#### TIM

Yeah! You're not allowed in! They're like 'sir, where's your ID?' and you're like _(blubbering)_ 'I'm just a little baby!'

#### BEN 

_(high squeaky voice)_ I'm a little baby!

#### TIM

Okay. Where do you want to take that from?

------

##### [transition beep]

#### BEN

"Okay. Well, why don't you actually try?"

#### TIM 

_(verge of tears)_ "Because trying is difficult! And I don't want to do it!"

#### BEN

"...Uh-huh. Okay, well, if you don't want to try, why don't you just sit there quietly, and I'll work it out?"

#### TIM

"Because that would make for a bad end to the podcast."

##### [transition beep]

#### ERIN <a id="footnote-2-ref" href="#footnote-2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>

I needed to fart and sneeze at the same time.

##### [Tim and Ben burst into laughter]

#### TIM

Now do both.

#### ERIN

_(crosstalk)_ I was like-- I was like... clench butt. Mhmgh.

#### TIM

Mhmmgn!

#### ERIN

Sorry, they've both gone.

#### TIM

__[laughs]__ They'll come out later.

#### ERIN

_(crosstalk)_ They've both been absorbed back into my body.

##### [Tim and Erin laugh]

#### BEN

'I killed them.'

#### ERIN

They'll just come out later.

#### TIM

'Now I can't p-**[bleep]** for two days.'

#### ERIN 

_(still laughing)_ Ten times worse. I went for a scan at the hospital the other day, and I had such bad farts, the woman couldn't see my ovaries.

##### [laughter explodes]

#### TIM

What, so your colon was so inflated [__ERIN:__ Yeah!] that you couldn't see-- _(as their doctor)_ 'We have literal X-rays that look through your body, and we cannot see-- We've got a magnetic resonance machine that costs millions of pounds, and your farts have defeated it.'

#### ERIN 

_(still laughing)_ We went all the way to Haywards Heath to be told I had the farts. I was like, 'I f-**[bleep]**-ing know; you should smell my car!' Like-- __[Ben and Tim lose it]__ It's disgusting!

#### TIM 

_(as their doctor)_ I'm afraid it's 'stink car.' It's terminal.

#### ERIN

We had to leave the car with all the doors open in the carpark.

#### TIM

We thought that-- you were like, I mean, nobody's stealing this. _(as a car robber)_ 'Ooh, car! Oh no!'

#### BEN

'Oh, Jesus Christ!'

#### TIM 

__[after laughter calms down]__ Now this is gonna go into some extra content, by the way. __[laughs]__

#### ERIN

Yeah, that's fine. Yeah, have it. Do it. Do what you like with it. Let it be known.

#### TIM

Let it be known.

#### BEN

"Okay. The next case we've got is from--"

"Case? That was last week, buddy."

#### BEN

"Shut up."

#### TIM

"Okay, let's take that one again."

#### ERIN

I need to burp.

#### TIM

"Hang on, [Erin's] gonna have a burp."

#### ERIN 

__[burps]__ Sorry.

#### TIM

You angled it into the mic!

#### BEN 

_(crosstalk)_ "Burp break! Burp break!"

_(crosstalk)_ 'I'm gonna burp. Hang on.' __[loud fake burp]__

#### ERIN 

_(crosstalk)_ "So sorry."

#### BEN 

_(quietly)_ "Burp break!"

#### TIM

Okay.

##### [transition beep]

#### BEN

"J'accuse!"

#### TIM

"J'abused! Is I! F-**[bleep]**-k you!"

##### [everyone laughs]

#### ERIN

Stunning.

#### BEN

"Wow, that escalated!"

#### TIM

J'accuse me again.

#### BEN

"J'... bounce-off-me-and-- That was awful! I shouldn't--"

#### TIM 

_(crosstalk)_ "J'I-am-rubber, j'I-am-glue!"

#### BEN 

_(crosstalk)_ Shouldn't have tried. Shouldn't have tried. Shouldn't have tried.

#### ERIN

"Never try!"

#### TIM 

_(laughing)_ Never try! Right, do it again.

#### BEN

"Well, that's the Trexel Geistman way!"

#### ERIN

"If you can't try, you can't fail!"

#### TIM

J'accuse me again. J'accuse me again.

#### TIM

"J'I-am-rubber, j'you-are-groo-- glue-- rah!" __[blows a raspberry]__

_(crosstalk)_ "Okay, we've had enough with these--"

#### TIM

F\*ck, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. __[Ben laughing]__ I wanna say the words properly! Okay.

##### [transition beep]

#### BEN

Well, anyway, I mean, but-- broadly, it's-- __[trying not to laugh]__

#### TIM 

_(wheezing)_ You can stop now.

##### [Ben snorts, general undecipherable chaos and laughing]

#### ERIN

So sorry. Boobies everywhere. Aw, she's got--

#### TIM 

_(announcer voice)_ Unfortunately, the audio artifacts from the boob shaking has caused interference on the recording.

#### ERIN

Have they?

#### TIM

No! No. __[Erin laughs loudly]__ Of course not!

##### [everyone laughs]

#### BEN

Your-- your burb-- boobs are reverberating at the exact opposite of radio frequencies, thus eliminating any sound waves!

#### TIM

It's just that what we'll do is they'll foley put in shaking, so obviously, if you're continuously shaking...

#### ERIN

I wanna shake!

#### TIM

Look, I'm not here to tell people when they can or cannot--

#### ERIN

It's my f-**[bleep]**-ing Sunday, alright, I wanna shake. __[Tim laughs]__ Jesus Christ.

#### TIM

But we'll put it in, 'cause otherwise you'll get very tired as well.

#### ERIN 

_(laughing)_ Yes.

"Take that. Throwing some shade."

"I didn't get a choice, this is just the--"

"Mmm, yas queen."

#### BEN

"--onesie I was given to--" __[breaks into laughter]__ Tim!

#### TIM

I am going to say it!

#### BEN

You can't say 'yas queen!'

#### TIM

Ah, can't I? "Yas queen!"

#### BEN

Okay, you can, but you... shouldn't?

#### TIM

Shouldn't I?

#### BEN

I don't know!

#### TIM

"Shouldn't I?"

#### BEN

Isn't that a little bit contemporary?

#### TIM

__[sucks teeth]__ Uh, I've referenced Monopoly. __[laughs]__

#### BEN

Since we've been like-- __[disappointed sigh]__ Well, we missed that one. Let's not slide down the slippery slope--

#### TIM

_(crosstalk)_ Alright. I'm gonna-- I'm gonna say 'throw shade' and I'm gonna say 'you dragged him'.

#### BEN

But I'm not gonna-- Look, I watched *RuPaul's Drag Race* on an old holovid. __[chuckles]__

#### BEN

I burped away from-- Look. Okay.

#### JENNY

David, you're very burpy today.

#### BEN

So, I have to burp away from the microphones __[Jenny laughs]__ so that means I have to burp vaguely towards you.

#### JENNY

_(crosstalk)_ At me! __[laughs]__

#### TIM

_(crosstalk)_ At Jenny. Thank you so much for being on the podcast Jenny but 'burp noise.' __[Jenny makes an exaggerated burping noise, laughs]__ I like the time it takes--

#### JENNY

'Kay. Where do we go ba-- Uh, where--

We take this--

We've been doing this for 40 episodes now! __[laughs]__

#### JENNY

So you're in the expediting--

##### [transition beep]

#### BEN

"Try and find out what they're tryna think of do for us. That was not a sentence! Help."

#### TIM

"Try to find out to think of do for us."

#### BEN

_(laughing)_ I know!

#### TIM

The only 'do for us' around here is you.

#### BEN

Ooh!

#### TIM

Oh ho!

#### BEN

A zinger but hurtful.

#### TIM

__[laughs]__ At least now I've got some distance. I'm out-- I'm out of swinging range, so you can't get me.

------

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

"Can you tell I've got a catchphrase for this, __[laughs]__ this episode. Oh--"

#### BEN

"Is it, um--" Oh Gonk.

#### TIM

"Oh Gonk."

#### BEN

"Oh Gonk."

#### TIM

Trying to recap the magic that was __[laughs]__ Cardinal Fang, you see. __[laughs, Ben joins in]__

#### BEN

_(raspy voice)_ You're always chasing that 'Fang' high.

#### TIM

Mmmmm, give me that 'Fang' high! __[laughs, Ben chuckles]__ Oh, that could be a good vampire high school sitcom.

#### BEN

What, Fang High?

#### TIM

Fang High. __[laughs]__

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

"I found what kind of god I am! I'm that one! I'm the tenet--" __[mouth noises]__ Flonk. Beep beep. _(operator voice)_ I'm sorry. The Trexel you were looking for is not currently available. __[chuckles]__

#### BEN

__[laughs]__ Ah, I do like the fact that-- I do like the idea that Trexel just can't say telekinetic.

#### TIM

Telekenamana! Uh... __[laughs]__

#### BEN

Telemanetic!

##### [both continue butchering the word 'telekinetic']

#### TIM

"Tele-- I'm not the kind of god that can say that!" __[chuckles]__

#### BEN

Kevelabeckic!

#### TIM

Okay. Right, right. Okay.

#### BEN

The-- the think-mover!

#### TIM

__[laughs]__ "They call me the think-mover! The-- the-- the thing shifter! Um, no."

#### BEN

Wait, no. Save it for the tape.

#### TIM

They call me the urban goose. __[Ben laughs]__ Um, right.

#### TIM

Yes. __[Amy laughs]__ All this is-- This is all going to Maddy.

#### AMY

Who's editoring it-- Oh, Maddy.

#### TIM

_(crosstalk)_ Who's edit-- editorising it?

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

We'll-- Wait. Hang on. We're just taking a moment so Amy can burp.

#### AMY

And scratch. Scratch and burp like I'm a dog.

#### BEN

Burp break!

#### TIM

Hang on.

#### AMY

It's not working.

#### BEN

Anyone else need to burp and scratch... anything?

#### RACHEL

Hang on.

#### BEN

No?

#### RACHEL

Was it just Tim, apparently.

#### TIM

Yeah, yeah, yeah. __[mouth trumpet noise]__ Okay.

Alright.

Okay. Right.

You're a c-**[bleep]**-tsiderate laughter. That's right.

#### BEN

Jesus Christ!

#### TIM

Yeah. That's right. That's right.

#### BEN

Can't take-- can't take that and put it into bloopers, can we?

Oh! Is that-- Sorry. What ho? Do I see the p-**[bleep]**-ss men afore me? __[Ben laughs]__ *(sings)* ♪ P-**[bleep]**-ss men. P-**[bleep]**-ss men. [incomprehensible] ♫

#### BEN

Didn't realise it was a p-**[bleep]**-ss man parade over here!

#### TIM

__[laughs]__ *(to the tune of "Stars and Stripes Forever")* ♪ Na na na-na na, the p-**[bleep]**-ss man parade! The p-**[bleep]**-ss-- ♫

#### BEN

Best-- __[chuckles]__ best thing about this is obviously any of Helen's-- __[Tim laughs]__ Helen is not being recorded so we just tal-- started talking about p-**[bleep]**-ss men out of absolutely nowhere!

#### TIM

Yes. Oh, no.

#### BEN

For completely *no* context.

#### TIM

Finally, the heat of the recording rooms has melted their brains. __[Ben laughs]__ Okay. Right.

##### [transition beep]

#### HELEN

They say-- they say that it's like-- like, it's like a buttcrack, full of mildew.

#### TIM

Wow. __[over Ben and Helen crying with laughter]__ Okay! Book me in. Sign me up. Wowee.

#### BEN

I think that might be the-- I mean, look, deliver the line again, [__TIM:__ Yeah yeah yeah.] we gotta do it without laughing. I think that is going to be the dirtiest that we've ever been on this podcast so--

#### TIM

Buttcrack filled with mildew.

#### BEN

F-**[bleep]**-in' filthy.

#### TIM

That's awful.

#### HELEN

Okay.

##### [transition beep]

#### BEN 

_(doing a Trexel voice)_ This is what we call a reference, or a call-back!

#### TIM

"It's a reference! Guys, it's a reference!"

#### BEN 

_(Trexel voice)_ We're building out the world to be a whole and real thing, instead of just a bunch of garbage we've made up.

#### TIM

We don't have to do a joke, we could just do a reference! It's as good as!

#### BEN

'Ha! I recognised that thing!'

#### TIM 

_(impersonating a vine)_ 'Ha! I do that!' Right. Um...

#### BEN 

_(laughing)_ What, have a knife put-- yeah, really-- really hashtag relatable content there.

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. Hey, them sweet vines. Right. Okay.

"Anyway, aren't you going to fall down a pit any time soon?"

#### TIM

What do you mean-- _(as if falling, but a bit half-heartedly)_ Wahhh!! __[laughter]__ Sorry, I forgot about that.

##### [Ben laughs]

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

"Yes, yes, it is fun. It's fun to have mail paraphernalia on your feet."

#### BEN

"Yes."

#### TIM

Hang on a minute. The phase 'mail paraphernalia'-- __[laughs]__

#### BEN

Oh yes! Oh *yes*.

#### TIM

Oh dear. Are we keeping that? Mail paraphernalia?

#### BEN

That is known as a _(French pronunciation)_ 'double entendre.'

#### TIM

Mh-hmhm! Whoopsie!

#### BEN

A double intender. And, I feel like, if *Round the Horne* could do something like that, we should be able to do something like that.

#### TIM 

_(quietly)_ Yes.

#### BEN

If we can get it past--

#### TIM

Are you going to say 'ooh 'er'?

#### BEN 

__[laughs]__ Ooh 'er ducky.

#### TIM

Ooh 'er ducky.

We're just all-- __[laughs]__

#### BEN

What? Yeah, I just--

#### TIM

_(laughing)_ Sorry, I just did that but that bit went on for so long. __[deep sigh]__ "Right. __[deep sigh]__ Okay. __[deep sigh]__ Ooh-a."

#### BEN

_(sarcastically offended)_ Alright. Alright. You're just, uh-- __[Tim laughs softly]__ you're not vibing with my method. Fine. It's all right. It's all good.

#### TIM

It'll be edited down. It'll be edited down.

#### BEN

It's called 'acting', Tim.

#### TIM

I don't know what that is.

#### BEN

I'm living in the moment.

#### TIM

I don't know what it is.

#### BEN

I'm living-- _(whispers)_ Amateur.

#### JENNY

I'm in the freakin' zone! Not the clap zone, I'm in the scene zone!

#### AMY

_(laughing)_ That's the best-- best *ever*... eye roll and swear under breath I've ever seen in my life.

#### RACHEL

That was incredible.

#### TIM

It's okay.

#### RACHEL

_(simult.)_ Waaaaay!

#### AMY

_(simult.)_ Wheeeee!

#### RACHEL

Feels wrong not doing it as 'waaay'!

Okay, you can do it as a 'way'. Let's do-- let's do another take but with the Marsha way.
