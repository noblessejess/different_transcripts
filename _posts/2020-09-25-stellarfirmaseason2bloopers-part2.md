##### [shorter version of the show theme]

#### TIM

Hello, and welcome to part 2 of the Stellar Firma season 2 bloopers, because we know that if nothing else our fans are gluttons for the punishment that is our consistent and abject failure. Look, this feels negative. They're fun! They're bloopers! Supposed to be fun. Enjoy them! Don't cry. Stop crying!

"I've got-- I've got two--"

#### JENNY

__[as Hartro as Ortrah]__ "Chauncey, you present your elaborate, uh, portrayal in front of Big John John and he falls over dead __[Ben snorts, Tim laughs]__ with surprise!"

#### TIM

__[laughing]__ What's that--

#### BEN

__[laughing]__ Sorry-- __[breaks into laughter]__

#### TIM

Sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. __[laughs]__

#### BEN

Didn't expect to go there! But it did.

#### TIM

__[laughing]__ Okay. __[laughs]__

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

__[as Trexel as Chauncey]__ "I sidle up to her and say, 'Hey there, chicken. Want to dance?' What-- what skill do I use for that?"

#### BEN

"You didn't use your voice."

#### TIM

"Sorry--"

#### JENNY

"And remember--"

#### TIM

__[trying to do Trexel as Chauncey, interrupting]__ "Hey there, chicken." [__JENNY:__ Your--] "What? That's not the voice." __[laughs, Jenny chuckles]__

#### BEN

__[sounding like Elvis]__ Well, hey there, chicken. __[chuckles]__

#### TIM

Sorry. Sorry.

------

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

Shall we just have it so like-- 'Well, okay, so we fail. What happens now?' 'I think you know what happens, Trexel.'

#### JENNY

Okay.

#### TIM

And then you put the foot in.

#### JENNY

Alright.

##### [Ben laughs]

#### JENNY

Just-- This is proof that it's-- the foot is not all me!

#### BEN

Wait! Sh-__[bleep]__! Tim, we've been rumbled!

#### TIM

We've been-- __[laughs]__

#### JENNY

This is proof!

#### TIM

Look, no no no--

#### BEN

You introduced it!

##### [Jenny chuckles]

#### TIM

You introduced it. We're not saying--

#### JENNY

You want the foot. [__BEN:__ Oh, we-- Oh!] You keep asking for the foot.

#### BEN

Look--

#### TIM

Okay. Okay, okay. We've never denied--

##### [Jenny laughs softly in the background]

#### BEN

This has now been recorded. Jenny just said, 'You want the foot'.

#### TIM

You want the foot. Somebody--

#### BEN

And that, that is on audio.

#### TIM

Somebody cut that out for __[Jenny sighs]__ something unsavory. __[chuckles]__

#### JENNY

Okay. Okay.

#### TIM

You want the foot. Right. Okay.

#### JENNY

_(crosstalk)_ Alright. So...

#### BEN

Some sort of musical remix.

#### TIM

Yes. __[mimicking EDM style]__ ♪ You you-- ♫

"Well, it was lovely to see you, Hartro, and I, I hope-- I hope we... do better next time. I don't f-__[bleep]__-ing know what I was-- __[all laugh]__ [incomprehensible] I hope you fall down a well. __[all laugh, Ben snorts and starts laughing again]__ Hartro, f-__[bleep]__ you!"

##### [Jenny and Ben laugh]

##### [transition beep]

#### BEN

"Pooping!"

#### TIM

"H-- What?"

#### BEN

"I was pooping."

#### TIM

"I don't think we're having that Ben." __[laughs]__

#### BEN

"Why not?"

#### TIM

"Pooping in the corner?"

#### BEN

"Why not?"

#### TIM

"Really?"

#### BEN

I have my pod! __[Tim laughs]__ I have a toilet. It's been explicitly established. Why does he just neg me? [__TIM:__ I don't-- __[breaks into laughter]__] Honestly, yes and. Yes and!

#### TIM

__[laughing]__ I don't-- I don't like the pooping.

#### BEN

I said poop. I'm not actually pooping, Tim!

#### TIM

It made me uncomfortable.

#### BEN

This is not gonna become poo play!

------

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

I was almost gonna stop you and say, 'Why not put on an Out of Office?' __[laughs, Ben joins in] [sounding like a recording]__ "'I'm sorry, David 7 cannot be reached at this time!' __[Ben laughs loudly]__ Correct, David." __[Ben continues laughing]__

#### BEN

"You might very well say that. I couldn't possibly comment!"

#### TIM

Right. Okay. Cool. That's good. Um--

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

"The Trexel Geistman 10 Steps to Sales Success Program!"

#### BEN

"Oh, yes--"

#### TIM

"That's not its name! That's not its name!" __[Ben laughs]__ Trexel Geist--

#### BEN

It only has the name 'Domination' in there somewhere but yeah.

#### TIM

Trexel Geistman 10 Steps to Sales Domination. __[Ben laughs]__ Right.

#### BEN

It says something about your character that I was like, 'This could absolutely be in the edit.'

#### TIM

Okay. Give me a mo'. Right.

------

##### [transition beep]

##### [hand clap marker]

#### TIM

Just-- Why do I clap?! I ca-- I haven't thought of anything yet! I was just like, 'Tim start.' __[Ben laughs]__ Wawoowoowoo.

#### BEN

'Tim, I wasn't ready. Why did you do this to me, Tim?'

#### TIM

'Hang on. I'll think of something at the end of this clap. __[hand clap marker]__ Eh, that didn't work.' __[Ben laughs]__ Uhh... Right.

#### BEN

Well, to be fair, it's the improv way.

------

##### [transition beep]

#### BEN

"Are you human?"

#### TIM

__[on the verge of having an existential crisis]__ "Am I human?"

#### BEN

"Or are you dancer?"

#### TIM

"Is it-- Da, f-__[bleep]__ off."

#### BEN

That's-- __[breaks into laughter]__

#### TIM

I was gonna b-- I was about to have an existential moment and you made a Coldplay reference.

#### BEN

Ha ha! It's The Killers.

#### TIM

Is it Killers?

#### BEN

Yeah.

#### TIM

Basically, it's the same thing at this stage.

#### BEN

Also, might be Brandon Flowers's solo album.

#### BEN

"Trexel, check your passlock!"

#### TIM

"Ah, oh! My what?" __[snickers]__

#### BEN

"Passlock."

#### TIM

"My passlock?"

#### BEN

"Yes because passports are because you can pass through ports, and we have airlocks so you can pass through airlocks."

#### TIM

"Oh, I apologise!"

#### BEN

"I'm world building here!"

#### TIM

"I apologise!"

#### BEN

"It's really good!"

#### TIM

It's really good--

#### BEN

"It's a deep cut--"

#### TIM

It's a deep-- __[chuckles]__

#### BEN

"--but I'm very proud of it."

#### TIM

Okay. Look--

#### BEN

"I realise without context... __[chuckles]__ But once I've explained it, it makes a whole bunch of sense."

#### TIM

Okay. Okay. Okay.

------

##### [transition beep]

Oh god, did you start?

Oh, no.

And I will get on a train and come to Scotland and go through it just to show I care.

They've got good escape rooms in Scotland.

I-- Are they known for it?

No, I think just Edinburgh and Glasgow are very good for it. [__TIM:__ Okay.] But not known-- Anyway, this is-- __[Tim chuckles]__ Now I'm doing the-- I'm sorry David. It's his influence.

#### TIM

I'll speak the name again.

It's a funny name.

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

Right, we're back in the room.

#### BEN [deep sultry voice]

Hello.

#### TIM

Okay.

#### BEN [deep sultry voice]

Why couldn't I just have this voice? __[Tim laughs]__ Everything's so stressful when you're with--

#### TIM [deep sultry voice]

We're two very soft characters.

#### BEN [deep sultry voice]

I'm just going to have a very calm discussion about things.

#### TIM [deep sultry voice]

This is a podcast about lemon tea. __[moaning]__ Mm. Lemon tea.

#### BEN [deep sultry voice]

Okay. That's-- he's made it weirdly sexual.

#### TIM [deep sultry voice]

Mm, I've drunk lemony-- __[Continues to make moaning noises while Ben talks]__

Oh lord.

#### BEN

See? See what I mean?

#### TIM

__[deep sultry voice]__ You mean to engage in wound management? Mm-hmm.

#### BEN

Mm-hmm.

#### TIM [deep sultry voice]

Hmm. __[laughs] [normal voice]__ Right, okay.

#### BEN [laughs]

I keep forgetting that we are not doing this just to ourselves.

#### TIM

Yeah.

I am so sorry, Maddy.

Sorry about-- __[realisation]__ Oh god, no! __[Ben laughs]__ Oh, I'm sorry! Ohh, Maddy, I'm so sorry. We're sorry. Please contact HR for the crimes.

"Ugh, damn that DA Dartro Diltz! Her detrimental... de-clarifications! Damn it! Damn it!" __[laughs]__ Alright, I'm gonna go take--

"I am."

#### TIM

__[Ben laughs loudly while Tim talks]__ Alright, alright, Jesus! Alright. F-__[bleep]__-in' hell. __[weird voice]__ A bit of the art has crept out in the character there.

#### BEN

Yeah, apparently I'm really-- Tim, I'm really jealous of all of your ability to go to bars and whatever.

#### TIM

Yeah! You're not allowed in! They're like 'sir, where's your ID?' and you're like __[blubbering]__ 'I'm just a little baby!'

#### BEN [high squeaky voice]

I'm a little baby!

#### TIM

Okay. Where do you want to take that from?

------

##### [transition beep]

#### BEN 

"Okay. Well, why don't you actually try?"

#### TIM [verge of tears]

"Because trying is difficult! And I don't want to do it!"

#### BEN

"...Uh huh. Okay, well, if you don't want to try, why don't you just sit there quietly, and I'll work it out?"

#### TIM

"Because that would make for a bad end to the podcast."

##### [transition beep]

#### ANNIE

I needed to fart and sneeze at the same time.

##### [Tim and Ben burst into laughter]

#### TIM

Now do both.

#### ANNIE

I was like-- I was like... clench butt. Mhmgh.

#### TIM

Mhmmgn!

'I killed them.'

#### ANNIE 

They'll just come out later.

#### TIM

'Now I can't p-__[bleep]__ for two days.'

#### ANNIE [still laughing]

I went for a scan at the hospital the other day, and I had such bad farts the woman couldn't see my ovaries.

##### [laughter explodes]

#### TIM

What, so your colon was so inflated [__ANNIE__: Yeah!] that you couldn't see-- __[as her doctor]__ 'We have literal X-rays that look through your body, and we cannot see-- We've got a magnetic resonance machine that costs millions of pounds, and your farts have defeated it.'

#### ANNIE [still laughing]

We went all the way to Haywards Heath to be told I had the farts. I was like, 'I f-__[bleep]__-ing know; you should smell my car!' __[Ben and Tim lose it]__ It's disgusting!

#### TIM [as her doctor]

I'm afraid it's 'stink car.' It's terminal.

#### ANNIE

We had to leave the car with all the doors open in the carpark.

#### TIM

We thought that-- you were like, I mean, nobody's stealing this. __[as a car robber]__ 'Ooh, car! Oh no!'

#### BEN

'Oh, Jesus Christ!'

#### TIM [after laughter calms down]

Now this is going to go into some extra content, by the way. __[laughs]__

#### ANNIE

Yeah, that's fine. Yeah, have it. Do it. Do what you like with it. Let it be known.

#### TIM

Let it be known.

"Okay, let's take that one again."

#### ANNIE

I need to burp.

#### TIM

"Hang on, Annie's gonna have a burp."

#### ANNIE [burps]

Sorry.

#### TIM__: You angled it into the mic!

#### BEN [crosstalk]

"Burp break! Burp break!"

#### TIM [crosstalk]

'I'm gonna burp. Hang on.' __[loud fake burp]__

Shouldn't have tried. Shouldn't have tried. Shouldn't have tried.

#### ANNIE

"Never try!"

#### TIM [laughing]

Never try! Right, do it again.

J'accuse me again. J'accuse me again.

#### ANNIE

So sorry. Boobies everywhere. She's got--

#### TIM [announcer voice]

Unfortunately the audio artifacts from the boob shaking has caused interference on the recording.

#### ANNIE

Have they?

#### TIM

No! __[Annie laughs loudly]__ Of course not!

##### [everyone laughs]

#### BEN

Your burb-- boobs are reverberating at the exact opposite of radio frequencies, thus eliminating any sound waves!

#### TIM

It's just that what we'll do is they'll foley put in shaking, so obviously if you're continuously shaking...

#### ANNIE

I wanna shake!

#### TIM

Look, I'm not here to tell people when they can or cannot--

#### ANNIE

It's my f-__[bleep]__-ing Sunday, alright, I wanna shake.__ [Tim laughs]__ Jesus Christ.

You can't say 'yas queen!'

Ah, can't I? "Yas queen!"

#### BEN

Okay, you can, but you... shouldn't?

#### TIM

Shouldn't I?

#### BEN

I don't know!

#### TIM

"Shouldn't I?"

#### BEN

Isn't that a little bit contemporary?

#### TIM

__[sucks teeth]__ Uh, I've referenced Monopoly. __[laughs]__

#### BEN

Since we've been like-- __[disappointed sigh]__ Well, we missed that one. Let's not slide down the slippery slope--

David, you're very burpy today.

#### BEN

So, I have to burp away from the microphones __[Jenny laughs]__ so that means I have to burp vaguely towards you.

#### JENNY

_(crosstalk)_ At me! __[laughs]__

#### TIM

_(crosstalk)_ At Jenny. Thank you so much for being on the podcast Jenny but 'burp noise.' __[Jenny makes an exaggerated burping noise, laughs]__ I like the time it takes--

#### TIM

"Try to find out to think of do for us."

#### BEN

__[laughing]__ I know!

#### TIM

The only 'do for us' around here is you.

#### BEN

Ooh!

#### TIM

Oh ho!

#### BEN

A zinger but hurtful.

#### TIM

__[laughs]__ At least now I've got some distance. I'm out-- I'm out of swinging range, so you can't get me.

"I found what kind of god I am! I'm that one! I'm the tenet--" __[mouth noises]__ Flonk. Beep beep. __[operator voice]__ I'm sorry. The Trexel you were looking for is not currently available. __[chuckles]__

#### BEN

__[laughs]__ Ah, I do like the fact that-- I do like the idea that Trexel just can't say telekinetic.

#### TIM

Telekenamana! Uh... __[laughs]__

#### BEN

Telemanetic!

##### [both continue butchering the word 'telekinetic']

#### TIM

"Tele-- I'm not the kind of god that can say that!" __[chuckles]__

Okay. Right, right. Okay.

We'll-- Wait. Hang on. We're just taking a moment so Amy can burp.

And scratch. Scratch and burp like I'm a dog.

Burp break!

Hang on.

#### AMY

It's not working.

#### BEN

Anyone else need to burp and scratch... anything?

#### RACHEL

Hang on.

Yes. Oh, no.

#### TIM

That's awful.

#### HELEN

Okay.

#### BEN [doing a Trexel voice]

This is what we call a reference, or a call-back!

#### TIM

"It's a reference! Guys, it's a reference!"

#### BEN [Trexel voice]

We're building out the world to be a whole and real thing, instead of just a bunch of garbage we've made up.

#### TIM

We don't have to do a joke, we could just do a reference! It's as good as!

#### BEN

'Ha! I recognised that thing!'

#### TIM 

__[impersonating a vine]__ 'Ha! I do that!' Right. Um...

"Yes, yes, it is fun. It's fun to have mail paraphernalia on your feet."

#### BEN

"Yes."

#### TIM

Hang on a minute. The phase 'mail paraphernalia'-- __[laughs]__

#### BEN

Oh yes! Oh *yes*.

#### TIM

Oh dear. Are we keeping that? Mail paraphernalia?

#### BEN

That is known as a __[French pronunciation]__ 'double entendre.'

#### TIM

Mh-hmhm! Whoopsie!

#### BEN

A double intender. And, I feel like, if Round the Horne could do something like that, we should be able to do something like that.

#### TIM [quietly]

Yes.

#### BEN

If we can get it past--

#### TIM

Are you going to say 'ooh 'er'?

#### BEN [laughs]

Ooh 'er ducky.

Ooh 'er ducky.

Alright. Alright. You're just, uh-- __[Tim laughs softly]__ you're not vibing with my method. Fine. It's all right. It's all good.

#### TIM

It'll be edited down. It'll be edited down.

#### BEN

It's called 'acting', Tim.

#### TIM

I don't know what that is.

#### BEN

I'm living in the moment.

I don't know what it is.

#### RACHEL

That was incredible.

It's okay.

__[simultaneously]__ Waaaaay!

__[simultaneously]__ Wheeeee!
