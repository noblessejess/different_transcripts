#### TREXEL

Special thanks to Adam Honeyman -- never give a sucker an even break. Break their bones in irregular places -- it makes it more exciting for the medical team.

#### IMOGEN

Rusty Quill presents: Stellar Firma.

##### [theme continues]

#### DAVID

_(jittery)_ Oh... Where are they? They were gonna be early. Wait, what was-- Has something happened? Ohhhh, c-- Come on! Just, just turn up... now!

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ This hasn't worked the last 458 attempts. Were it to work now, it would be sheer coincidence.

#### DAVID

Turn up... Nnnnnnnnow! Turn up nnnnoo--

##### [vent slams open with a loud hissing noise; David is audibly startled]

#### ENOLA

David! David! David!

David!

#### DAVID

__[panting heavily]__ Oh! Enola, right!

#### ENOLA

_(echoey from vent)_ Hello!

#### DAVID

Hello.

#### ENOLA

Did you, um-- Hi. Hi! Oh, d-did you, did you want to, did you want to, um... [__DAVID:__ Yes, yes!] Did you read the leaflets?

#### DAVID

Yes. No, g-get down. Come on quick, quick, quick. [__ENOLA:__ Oh?] Get in, get in.

##### [fumbling and banging as Enola awkwardly emerges from vent]

#### DAVID

Sorry. There aren't any chairs, I don't think. It's just, it's just all walls. I don't know how to get anything out. But look, serious-- Okay. I-I need your help. And we need to, __[Enola sounds pleased]__ we need to get it, we need to get this done before Trexel turns up. I don't-- Why were you so late? What happened?

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Perhaps for narrative suspense?

#### ENOLA

Right. Yes. So, I-I've spent a lot of time in the vents, yes, but not, perhaps, in this particular area...

#### DAVID

So...?

#### ENOLA

Some may say I got lost.

#### DAVID

You got lost? Okay.

#### ENOLA

Maybe.

#### DAVID

Fine. But-- N-n-no problem. I just-- Look...

#### ENOLA

Yes?

#### DAVID

I need some information about the clones, a-a-a-a-and, and the [__ENOLA:__ Ooh!] clone production. I need some information about clone production, and we need to get this done before Trexel turns up! Because if Trexel turns up, then there's-- it's just going to be, like, a whole *thing* and--

#### ENOLA

We don't, we don't want Trexel and things.

#### DAVID

No, no, exactly!

#### ENOLA

And the worst thing is when-- Ooh, I said it again! __[makes disgusted sounds]__ Things and Trexel!

#### DAVID

Yeah. Okay. Just stop saying 'Trexel'! It might... summon him or something, but hopefully he'll be later than normal. Anyway, I need to know about the clone production facility. Like, where is it? Do you know where it is?

#### ENOLA

What do you mean? Why?

#### DAVID

Because-- Okay, look, don't tell anybody this, but I have a plan! A plan __[Enola gasps]__ to turn all of the clones and get--

##### [door whooshes as Trexel enters, audibly startling David]

#### TREXEL

Ah, there it is! There's when the day starts! It's Trex--

#### ENOLA

_(snarling)_ It's you!

#### TREXEL

It's you! David, what is the meaning of this?

#### DAVID

Ahhhh....

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ Why is this stinking pustule of festering nothing in *my* cons--

#### ENOLA

_(crosstalk)_ How dare you call me a pustule!

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ You are!

#### ENOLA

You gobbet of... pig spit!

#### TREXEL

You hunk of cosmic junk!

#### ENOLA

You decaying piece of cheese!

#### DAVID

_(nervous)_ Um...

#### TREXEL

You yellowing parchment that has only "BUMS!" written on it!

#### ENOLA

_(incensed and aggrieved)_ How dare you!

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ It's like a modern day Algonquin Round Table. If everyone was a jerk.

#### DAVID

Oh no, he dares.

#### TREXEL

Yes, you'll not get up from that one.

#### DAVID

Okay, n--

#### ENOLA

_(disconsolate)_ Ahhhh... the paper.

##### [rustling sounds]

#### DAVID

Are we done? Are we done? Are we good? Okay. Right!

#### ENOLA

_(distraught)_ No...

#### TREXEL

Well, I think we'll be done, David, when you extract this impos-- Why. Is. She. Here. David? What is the meaning of this?

#### DAVID

Who?

#### TREXEL

Enola! Look, look... __[burbles incoherently]__ They're right there!

##### [Enola giggles]

#### DAVID

No, they're not!

#### ENOLA

Oh, yes, no, I'm not here, I'm not here at all. [laughs] Yes, I'm, uh--

#### DAVID

Enola isn't here!

#### TREXEL

Okay. Okay. Well it seems that someone's trying to pull the synthetic wool over someone's eyes. Now, if Enola wasn't here, [__DAVID:__ Yes?] why is there the distinct smell of *failure* in the air? __[Enola gasps]__ Answer me that, David? Why is there failure stank? Oh, is it stinky failure cheese? No, it's stinky failure Enola!

#### DAVID

Um...

#### ENOLA

Ohhh, better than stinky murderer cheese!

#### DAVID

Or, is it? Is it? [__ENOLA:__ Yes!] Let's put it to a blind taste test. David! Eat our respective cheeses!

#### DAVID

Um, I don't--

#### TREXEL

Eat them!

#### DAVID

No. No. Okay. W--

#### TREXEL

They're metaphorical, David! Get with the program!

#### DAVID

But they're both disgusting! Alright, look, fine, yes, Enola is here! Hello Enola! Oh, um, right.

#### ENOLA

Hello!

#### DAVID

But...

#### ENOLA

_(softly)_ Hi.

#### DAVID

Just look... What do-- Trexel, you-- Tell you what? Go home early.

#### ENOLA

Yes, Trexel, leave!

#### TREXEL

Uh, Enola, this is between me and the clone.

#### ENOLA

No, it's between me and David! He has a name!

#### DAVID

I do have a name, and it is David *7*. It's David *7*.

#### ENOLA

Sorry.

#### TREXEL

Okay, fine. It's between me and David. Now David, [__DAVID:__ *(whispers)* Seven.] I would like nothing more than to totter off. I've got so many things I'd rather be doing [__DAVID:__ So go do them.] -- sleeping, falling over, drinking a clear fluid that I'm pretty sure is ethanol. It's, it's taking paint off of items in my room, so we, we must assume, but I don't think I can trust you to be left here [__DAVID:__ Wh--] with this bad influence; [__DAVID:__ No it--] I'm pointing at Enola.

#### ENOLA

No, I'm an excellent influence! I'm the best influence! Much better than you could ever hope for!

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ To be fair, that is a low bar.

#### TREXEL

You're the butt-influence. More butt than butt is, [__DAVID:__ Okay.] but-- I've got lost on butt!

#### DAVID

You are both broadly neutral influences, but it's fine. __[delighted sound from Enola]__ Trexel, we can be trusted; you can go home early, have a clear drink on me.

#### TREXEL

No. David. David. There is the delicate task of the brief that needs to be handled, and you can't handle it on your own, let alone with this festering hog!

#### DAVID

Right. Um, fine.

##### [mechanical clank and whirr as they access the briefing pod]

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Initiating.

#### DAVID

Look, tell you what-- Look, here's the brief. Here it is, uhhh... just, uh, rebrand your face. Look, done. I'll submit it now. Fine, yeah? I'm just gonna go submit it.

#### TREXEL

David? David look at me.

#### DAVID

Yes?

#### TREXEL

Do you honestly think you've done right by that client? Do you honestly think you've upheld the fine traditions of Stellar Firma with that brief?

#### ENOLA

Well, face rebranding is very popular these days, you know? I hear about it through, you know, the various, um--

#### TREXEL

See! She's getting involved! If I wasn't here, this whole brief would have been done by Enola by now. And they'd look at it and go, 'Why does this brief stink of sadness and loss?' __[Enola gasps]__ And then we'd be found out! Do the brief David; let's do the brief properly. Now.

#### DAVID

Yes, properly. So it smells of shouting and ethanol.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ The new fragrance from Stellar Firma Limited. Available from the gift shop.

#### TREXEL

Exactly. The two most beautiful elements, next, [__ENOLA:__ What a lie!] next to fighteron, the most violent element.

#### DAVID

If, if we get the brief done, you'll go, right?

#### TREXEL

Agreed? Agreed.

#### DAVID

Good. Okay.

#### ENOLA

_(hissed)_ Yes!

#### DAVID

So, this brief is--

#### TREXEL

Oh, we're not, we're not putting a bucket over Enola's head or something? She's just gonna be here doing this?

#### ENOLA

Don't you dare bucket me! I'll bucket you! And your bum!

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ Don't you bucket me, I'll, I'll bucket you, you bucket face!

#### DAVID

Tell you what, Trexel. If you can find a bucket in this room, you can put over it Enola and my head.

##### [various noises as Trexel starts opening panels and activating random bits of machinery]

#### TREXEL

Okay, I can-- No, that's a shower... ah, oh, that's the disco ball again! Damn it, ah... Okay, it would appear there's no, sort of, custodial closet in here, so I suppose we'll--

#### ENOLA

_(triumphant)_ Ah-hah!

#### TREXEL

Just keep, keep quiet, Enola, this isn't for you.

##### [Enola bristles]

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ Right. The brief--

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ David, please, let us as professionals do the brief.

#### DAVID

The brief is from Goral Throgmar.

#### TREXEL

__[chuckles]__ What a stupid na-- No, professional. What an important customer's name.

#### DAVID

He is "External Seeking Wisdom", and he is writing from us, from Construct-A-Creature.

#### TREXEL

Ah, Construct-A-Creature!

_(singing)_ Make a creature to your provisions.

We will fill it with ancient wisdom.

Construct-A-Creature. All the kids love them!

#### ENOLA

It's true, they do. [__DAVID:__ Okay.] They do.

#### DAVID

Well. Uh, I've just read ahead slightly, and I think maybe some of the, some of the kids might-- Well, the pare-- Look, "We are requesting tutelage from your Legal department. We have lawsuits coming out of our ears -- something to do with horrible conglomerations of creature parts not being 'ethical' or meeting 'health' and 'safety' standards, or something to do with 'mauling' and 'mangling'--

#### TREXEL

Lot of air quotes! Lot of air quotes!

#### DAVID

Ah, lots-- Everything is an air quote. Um, but "please help us deal with this before the space bailiffs take our eyes out. We really don't have the assets to spare."

#### ENOLA

Ooh, it's no good when they come for your eyes. That's when you know you've really messed up! __[chuckles]__

#### TREXEL

__[laughing along]__ That's right. The space bailiffs have-- __[splutters as realises is agreeing with Enola]__

Stop it, Enola! Stop! Stop coming to my level with your reasonable-- Shut your face!

#### ENOLA

I would never come to *your* level!

#### TREXEL

Oh, well, you would because my level is the top floor of greatness! You'd love to be here!

#### ENOLA

_(crosstalk)_ No, it isn't! No, it isn't!

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ You'd love to be. But you're on the mezzanine of a butt!

#### ENOLA

It is the basement of a big wellington boot!

#### DAVID

That's whatever basement the Cosmic Lounge *isn't* on.

#### TREXEL

So, if the space bailiffs are coming for you, watch it.

Now, there are two, there are two options here. Option one: _(adopts withering tone)_ deal with the systemic problems endemic to your product or service. Bluh-bluh-bluh.

It takes time. It takes money. It takes a day, and a half, sometimes. Let's not bother. What you do, is you give a false address on all of the legal forms. Space bailiffs can't get you if you haven't got the right space address. [__DAVID:__ Uh...] They'll turn up to, like, 123 Fake Star and be like, 'Give us all of your assets because of the lawsuits!' and then they're like, 'Oh, this is just a, a trash star.' __[chuckles]__ And then you're over in your quadrant, laughing and drinking out of a big wellington boot of victory.

#### ENOLA

Well, it sounds like they already have their address if they've received the letter.

#### DAVID

Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, look--

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ Oh, that's true, that's true. That is a complication, Enola, that I hadn't thought of.

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ It-- That, no-- It sounds-- No, it sounds fine. No, no, perfect, no problems, no we can just--

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ No, no, this won't work! Take it back, take it back to the core.

##### [David sighs and gives up]

#### ENOLA

_(crosstalk)_ Oh! Oh! Yes! Actually, yes, yes. Yes. That would be-- Yeah, do-- Yes. Heh, heh, heh. Yes.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ It has come to my attention that you are all your own special kind of idiot.

#### TREXEL

You're not very sneaky, are you Enola?

#### ENOLA

Well, you're not very... good.

#### TREXEL

_(sounds genuinely hurt)_ Ouch. That got me right where I-- I always thought I was quite good.

##### [starts sobbing, audible wet noises ensue]

#### TREXEL

_(bawling)_ David! She's a meanie! Take her away, I don't want to play anymore!

#### DAVID

Ahhh...

##### [continued sobbing and wet splashing]

#### ENOLA

He deserves this, David.

#### DAVID

I mean I'd-- Yeah... but now he's--

#### TREXEL

_(upset)_ I'd prefer the foot of Hartro. At least the foot, at least the foot's something I understand, but this is [__DAVID:__ I dunno--] just mean!

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ He's already made a--

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ You big meanie!

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ He's already made a puddle.

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ I'm gonna sit on the floor!

##### [slaps down very wetly]

#### DAVID

I just-- I dunno how, I don't know how one man can cry that much.

#### ENOLA

Well...

#### TREXEL

I'm a big sponge of tears.

#### DAVID

This is disgusting! It's all... gooey. It's like moist-- Oh no! Have you been back on the moisturiser?

#### TREXEL

_(still crying)_ Maybe. It's so silky in my mouth.

#### ENOLA

Oh dear... Sorry __[more crying, splashing and slurping from Trexel]__ about, about the moisturiser on your fe-- Maybe if we just, just step back a few-- Yes, yes. Back here, back here. Yes.

#### DAVID

Yeah, fine. Trexel, you're super good. You're very good.

#### TREXEL

I'm good. I'm okay... I'm okay...

#### ENOLA

Why would you lie to him?!

#### DAVID

What?

#### ENOLA

He needs the truth!

##### [Trexel continues to mumble and burble sadly in the background]

#### DAVID

If you tell him the truth, he goes back down, and the floor gets slippery again. Look, he's going-- Look. See?

##### [Enola sighs]

#### DAVID

This is why I've got to deal with. Anyway, look, please, just tell him he's good!

#### TREXEL

__[background burbling]__ Say I'm nice. Say I'm good.

##### [Enola sighs heavily]

#### DAVID

Then we can submit the brief.

#### TREXEL

__[background burbling]__ Say I'm a good.

#### ENOLA

You're--

You-- __[chokes up]__

You're go-- __[chokes up]__

#### DAVID

_(prompting)_ He's good.

#### ENOLA

You're goo-- __[choking noise gets worse]__

#### DAVID

_(prompting)_ He's good.

##### [Enola makes a strangled noise, as if wrestling with own throat]

#### DAVID

_(hisses)_ He's good.

#### ENOLA

_(strangled)_ You're good.

#### TREXEL

__[gasps, then resumes normal voice]__ Check and mate! Points to Trexel! That's right, I was pretending!

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ Okay, that is not how chess works.

#### TREXEL

Hee hee hee!

#### ENOLA

So this was all a game to you!

#### TREXEL

Hoh hoh!

#### ENOLA

I can take it back!

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ And yet none of us can take back the moments wasted listening to you both.

#### TREXEL

Ahhh, wonderful.

#### DAVID

_(weary)_ Don't, don't take it back, please. We don't have time. [__TREXEL:__ Wonderful. So.]

Right! Okay. So look, there's a problem. There's a problem, that they th-- that they, they have the lawsuit addresses to go to. [__TREXEL:__ Okay.] So the bailiffs will be like, 'Oh, we'll just have to go there'.

#### ENOLA

Oh yes, the bailiffs.

#### TREXEL

Reframe the debate.

#### DAVID

Great! Yes. Done. Let's send it.

#### TREXEL

The-- David. The issue here is that people feel that the, the creatures that they've constructed are mauling them and mangling them and causing loss of life. You know, all of the air quotes stuff. All you need to do is say 'No, no, no, you've misunderstood. These aren't, you know, *fun* toys. These aren't, these aren't, these aren't like soft, nice toys. These are... challenging training items. You know, let's say you've got a corporate event coming up, and you want your teams to bond. Well, get them all to design a horrifying homunculus combination of all of the offcuts of other creatures that is filled with the rage that would be in any being that was constructed in that way. Why must I live? Why must I live? If I must live, you must die. You understand? Genetics.'

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

'And then you have to fight them as a team in order to bond as a team. Team bonding!' Now--

#### DAVID

So, less Construct-a-Creature and more Build-a-Beast?

#### TREXEL

Ex-Exactly! It's still alliterative, which means it's a good business. All alliterative businesses must succeed, like, Big Bertie's Bouncing Bums. 'The number one bum specialists. Need a bum? Come to Bertie!'

#### DAVID

Is that a real business, or did you just make that up?

#### TREXEL

There's no time to look into it!

#### ENOLA

It is! It is real, I have, I've seen, I've seen the bums.

#### DAVID

Do you have one of Big Bertie's bums?

#### ENOLA

No! No, this, I-I grew this... myself. On a-- On *my* body.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ What a strange thing to have to claim.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

I dunno why this so hard for you to believe, David.

#### DAVID

Ye-yeah. Okay. Right. Yes. Anyway, so.. Th-The bailiffs are come round, they're, they're, they're knocking on-- They're like, 'Knock, knock, knock. We've come to take your eyes.' What are you-- What are we telling them?

#### TREXEL

David! David, you've brought up an important idea. Let's role play it. You're the bailiffs. I am the Construct-a-Creature, I don't know, Door Lackey. I don't normally roleplay such a lowly position, but for you, David, for you -- and only for you and not for Enola -- I will do it. Now--

#### DAVID

Okay. So who's-- But who's Enola?

#### TREXEL

Uh, Enola is a unspeaking houseplant in the corner.

#### ENOLA

No, I should be a *speaking* houseplant. They're very fun.

#### TREXEL

_(excited)_ Ooh. You know what? That is fun! Enola is a speaking houseplant; maybe they were cursed!

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Role play holovision initiated.

##### [electronic powering on sound]

#### TREXEL

Okay. Right, right, right, right, right.

#### DAVID

_(silly voice)_ A-Knock, knock, knock.

#### TREXEL

_(silly voice)_ And then a-opening the door.

#### ENOLA

Hello, stranger!

#### TREXEL

Houseplant, please! Will you give us a moment? I'm sorry. I have a cursed plant here, often they like to interject.

#### DAVID

That's very interesting. Uh, Houseplant, how did you become curs-ed?

#### ENOLA

I'm not cursed, this is a blessing that I was given by a friendly... star witch.

#### TREXEL

Oh, look, some pruning shears. Snip, snip!

#### ENOLA

Noooooo!

#### DAVID

Why did you just kill your houseplant?

#### ENOLA

Yes! Why would you kill-- I'm a ghost now, David. I'm a ghost plant now, David. _(adopts ghostly trill)_ Why did you kill me?

#### TREXEL

Think I've got a vacuum cleaner around here, somewhere...

#### DAVID

Point the first, now you're haunted. Point the second, take your eyes! Pow-pow!

#### TREXEL

Gah! Argh, ah! __[electronic powering off sound]__ Okay. Okay. Alright, I'll admit I failed that role play. I got too distracted by the houseplant, and I didn't do the whole 'convincing that our toys were actually training tools'. But, you know, you get the gist. I don't-- I don't know if we should do it again, I don't know if I can deal with that stupid pla--

#### ENOLA

_(crosstalk)_ Oh, I'd like to do it again!

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ No, I don't think I can deal with the--

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ Y'know, maybe--

#### ENOLA

_(crosstalk)_ Can I be a bigger houseplant?

#### DAVID

No, t-t-tell you what, actually tell you what-- Trexel can be the house plant. [__ENOLA:__ Ooh!] Um, I'll be the employee, and Enola, you could be the bailiff.

#### ENOLA

Okay.

#### TREXEL

Change places!

#### DAVID

Okay, right.

#### ENOLA

Okay, excellent!

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Role play holovision initiated.

##### [electronic powering on sound]

#### ENOLA

Ah, knocky-knocky-knocky!

#### DAVID

_(adopts silly voice again)_ Uh, a-opening the door. Oh, hello. How are you?

#### TREXEL

I'm full of chlorophyll!

#### DAVID

Hush, Houseplant!

#### TREXEL

I'm so turgid!

#### DAVID

Shh!

#### ENOLA

What a perfectly ordinary plant. Now, I'm here for your eyes. Please hand them over, yes?

#### DAVID

Ah, no, but, uh, for why are you coming for my eyes, dear bailiff?

#### TREXEL

Put water on my soil!

#### ENOLA

I simply do what's on the clipboard.

#### DAVID

S-Sorry, what was that, bailiff? Did you hear something? I-I don't think, no, it was, it was--

#### ENOLA

I heard nothing. However--

#### DAVID

No, it was nothing at all.

#### TREXEL

Splash me, bro!

#### DAVID

No, it was nothing--

#### ENOLA

They do not have to be *your* eyes. If you have-- If you happen to have other eyes available.

#### DAVID

Ah, well actually, um--

#### ENOLA

We'd also accept--

#### DAVID

There are, there are some googly eyes, ha-ha-haffixed to this houseplant. Maybe you can take them?

#### TREXEL

Not my gogglepeeps!

#### ENOLA

Ooh, how useful! More eyes for our eye collection.

#### TREXEL

Ah well, p-p-please...

#### ENOLA

Wonderful. __[Trexel shrieks]__ You may keep your eyes, and I accept these as substitute.

#### DAVID

Ah, wonderful.

#### ENOLA

'Cause that is how a not-bribe works.

#### DAVID

Well, have a luvverly day.

#### ENOLA

You too have a luvverly day, sir.

#### DAVID

Goodbye. Kisses!

##### [electronic powering off sound]

#### TREXEL

Okay, okay, it's over. No, this is, [__DAVID:__ What?] this over now.

#### DAVID

No, I think that was perfectly fine.

#### ENOLA

That's how it goes.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ None of that was how anything goes.

#### TREXEL

So what you're saying-- What you're saying, David--

#### DAVID

Mmm?

#### TREXEL

--to me--

#### DAVID

Mmm?

#### TREXEL

--in all seriousness--

#### DAVID

Mm-hmm.

#### TREXEL

--is you think that the way [__DAVID:__ Yep.] that they can turn away a bailiff is to trade googly eyes [__DAVID:__ Mm-hmm.] that they put on a cursed houseplant.

#### DAVID

Hundred percent

#### TREXEL

By Board, I think it might just work. You're a genius, David. You and me together! Only you and me, just these two! High five!

#### ENOLA

No, me!

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ High five! don't, don't leave me hanging, David.

#### ENOLA

_(crosstalk)_ Me, Trexel. I did it, Trexel.

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk, disapproving)_ Mmmm.

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ You didn't do it! David, don't leave me hanging!

#### DAVID

Compromise. Enola, put your hand up.

#### ENOLA

Okay.

#### TREXEL

What's that? What's this?

#### DAVID

Wha-pah!

##### [elated sounds from both Enola and Trexel]

#### TREXEL

Hoh-ho! The triple!

#### ENOLA

Very rare.

#### TREXEL

I'll take a, I'll take a hot slap pyramid.

#### DAVID

Okay. So we're agreed? We can, we can just put away the brief?

#### TREXEL

Yes, I think the brief is, is, is acceptably handled.

#### DAVID

Okay. I'm gonna submit the brief... and--

##### [electronic whirrs and buzzing of submission]

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Submitting!

#### ENOLA

Excellent. And now you leave, yes?

#### DAVID

--goodbye.

#### TREXEL

Leave?

#### DAVID

Yes.

##### [panel slams shut]

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ Leave, leave, leave. Now, if I was to leave--

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ Well, the brief is submitted.

#### TREXEL

If I was to leave that would leave you two to scheme and plot and-- [__DAVID:__ Mm-hmm.] Sleepover! Let's have a sleepover! I brought board games. __[shakes a box full of pieces]__ Now, this game is quite complicated--

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ Trexel?

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ It's called Trexel's Tribunal

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ Trexel? Trexel. Trexel. Shush. Trexel!

#### TREXEL

*(crosstalk)* __[unpacking noises]__ And it contains all of the legal documents that I'm supposed to have responded to--

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ This is-- Trexel, no-- This--

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ --but haven't got around to yet! You take this one, and you take one...

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ This is so important.

#### TREXEL

What?

#### DAVID

It's so important! I've just heard, over the IMOGEN, that they have a fire sale at the Astral Bar. Because the Astral Bar's on fire.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ You do not speak for me.

#### TREXEL

The fire I set has finally spread! Yes! [__DAVID:__ There you go!] Okay. Right. I'm going to go get some quick glass bargains! [__DAVID:__ Okay.] You wait here. [__DAVID:__ Alright.] And I'll be back in about 23 hours!

#### DAVID

Okay. B-B-Bye! Bye!

##### [door whooshes as Trexel exits]

#### DAVID

Okay, he's gone.

#### ENOLA

Oh yes, good.

#### DAVID

Right. Okay.

#### ENOLA

What a horrible, pompous twit!

#### TREXEL

That is the most he's wanted to work in... ever.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Mostly because he knew it would irritate you.

#### ENOLA

Well, I'm not surprised.

#### DAVID

No, anyway, okay, so, so, so what, what we were going to-- Right.

So, I-- I need to know, how are the clones made? Wh-where and how are the clones made?

#### ENOLA

Oh, well, you know, at the, uh, at the factory or the, you know, the big, the big pumping, uh, tube place.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ That is *not* its official name.

#### DAVID

The clone pump tube?

#### ENOLA

Essentially, yes. They, they sort of-- Have you ever seen, uh, one of those, um... um-um-um, cartoons where-- So it's, so it's like a drawing, but...

#### DAVID

Is it something like a wrestling holovid?

#### ENOLA

Yes...

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### ENOLA

...but colourful...

#### DAVID

I mean, they're quite colourful already. With the blood--

#### ENOLA

More colours than red, [__DAVID:__ Okay, yes, yes.] More colours than red. And, um, and, uh, two-dimensional [__DAVID:__ So... right.] and, um, so-- I'm getting-- __[starts burbling]__ You need, need a lot of context for this, but basically--

#### DAVID

So this is where they make the clones?

#### ENOLA

--when there are snakes, when there are snakes in a cartoon, when they swallow something, you can see the shape of it in the snake, because they're, they're big, large stretchy tubes, you see.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### ENOLA

And then if they sick it up, then it comes out perfectly-- And that's, that's how a clone is made. There's a big stretchy tube. And they pop out! And then they're put in the--

#### DAVID

So it's a big snake that vomits up clones?

#### ENOLA

Well, not a snake, a tube, but I-- Sorry, it was a reference I thought-- But, yes.

#### DAVID

So, there's a big tube somewhere?

#### ENOLA

Yes!

#### DAVID

Where's the big tube?

#### ENOLA

Well, I did get lost on the way here, you see, but it's sort of... sort of down... down and... right [__DAVID:__ Well, well, tell you, te--] and then, and then sort of in a circle and then sort of--

#### DAVID

Te-- Well, no ac-- just, look, tell, tell you what, I've got a map--

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Displaying restricted internal schematics.

#### DAVID

I've got a map here on IMOGEN. Just, just point to it.

#### ENOLA

Oh yes, it's this one!

#### DAVID

_(relieved)_ Oh, right. Okay. That-- Right. *That* big tube. Okay. I was a bit con-- There are, there are so many tubes here.

#### ENOLA

Yes, and you see it goes into this big repository...

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### ENOLA

...and then there's this-- Yes. And then this, um, they're kept in this holding... wardrobe, kind of thing. Like when, when I used to have, uh, when I used to have a wardrobe and, and, um, you know, you could just pick, pick your uniform off. [__DAVID:__ Right, so--] But instead of a uniform, it's a clone, you see?

#### DAVID

Okay, so there's a, so there's a-- Wait, how big is this facility?

#### ENOLA

Oh, it's, it's-- This is not-- This is, this map is not to scale actually. __[laughs]__

#### DAVID

So, is it.. big? Small? Big? Big?

#### ENOLA

Large.

#### DAVID

Big? How large?

#### ENOLA

Large tube!

#### DAVID

This big? Bigger?

##### [noises of consideration as Enola judges David's arm span]

#### ENOLA

Just... Let me, let me...

##### [extended sounds of clone extension, as David yelps in pain]

#### ENOLA

Yes! Yes, that big.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Arms are not generally meant to be spaced that far apart.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### ENOLA

So then, so, so, the clones come out of the tube, [__DAVID:__ Okay.] and then they're put in, sort of, the clone wardrobe, you know, [__DAVID:__ Okay.] until they're ready--

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### ENOLA

--for release. And, and, um, and then you, sort of, wake them up. Um...

#### DAVID

So they're all asleep in there?

#### ENOLA

Yes!

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### ENOLA

And then when you want one, you press the button and they go down the chute.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### ENOLA

And then you pick them up.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ A simple concept, interminably explained.

#### DAVID

Okay. Yes. Perfect. This is exactly what I need. If I can access the IMOGEN terminal there, then maybe I can send a remote signal...

#### ENOLA

But, why?

#### DAVID

What? Oh, uh--

#### ENOLA

What did-- I mean, the-- __[Enola starts sounding a little distressed]__

#### DAVID

Start some-- Well, we're gonna start a clone revolution. Right? Just convince them all the Board are bad, and they're just going to run amok.

##### [Enola is audibly taken aback by this news]

#### ENOLA

The Board are not bad, David! They are misled!

#### DAVID

Okay, fine. Yes. Okay. So... uh, I'm gonna convince them all the Board are misled, and I'm going to set them all to writing strongly-worded letters.

#### ENOLA

Oh, well, that's very good. But, um, but then when-- what about their jobs?

#### DAVID

Well, I mean, you--

#### ENOLA

What, what if, what if the Build Team? [__DAVID:__ Well, we've alr--] What if they don-- What if my old-- What if my friends, they don't have a clone [__DAVID:__ Well, they don't--] to send into, you know, the, the, the lava pit walkways, or--

#### DAVID

_(angry)_ Then they don't make them. Because that's fine. Because maybe-- I am a clone, right Enola?

#### ENOLA

Yes! And I like you very much.

#### DAVID

I don't want to do my job. It sucks!

#### ENOLA

But you, but you must! __[David hums his disagreement]__ For the good of the Board; for the good of all of Stellar Firma.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Hooray for highly limited principles.

#### DAVID

Fine. I-- Yeah, fine. I'm going to wake them all up, and give them a pep talk so they're super into their jobs. But on the side, maybe they send letters to the Board. Is that enough?

#### ENOLA

Well, you see-- The problem, the problem is, is, David-- I suppose I went, I went straight from, you know, you know, the, the schooling system straight into, into my job. And then, and then I was writing pamphlets and letters and things, and I don't really have-- I did-- Really, two things at the same time? Two things at the same... time? Hmmm. Theoretically, I suppose that's possible.

#### DAVID

Great. Well, I-I-I-- Tell you what. I'll, I'll send *you* a clone, so you can have help with your writing. __[Enola gasps]__ Right?

#### ENOLA

_(grateful)_ Oh, would you David?

#### DAVID

Yeah. I'll, I'll rustle you up a, a David, I guess.

#### ENOLA

Oh, David. Well, so here's the thing, David, there are clones and there are *clones*. Davids are... very good, but too dedicated--

#### DAVID

__[coughs warningly]__ Pardon?

#### ENOLA

You are very good. And so are the other Davids in your line, [__DAVID:__ Mm-hmm?] but also, [__DAVID:__ Mm-hmm?] I would quite like a Gary.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Oh yes. Everyone loves a Gary.

#### DAVID

A Gary?

#### ENOLA

Yes. They're very good at writing.

#### DAVID

A Gary?

#### ENOLA

Yes, they have very, they have very long fingers.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### ENOLA

They can hold many pens. It's--

#### DAVID

Fine. A Gary.

#### ENOLA

Yes!

#### DAVID

_(through gritted teeth)_ A real, real good letter-writing Gary. Gary with his letter-writing fingers! [__ENOLA:__ Um...] That I definitely don't want to snap! One by one!

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Caution: Clone temperature rising.

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk, angry)_ A horrible, little twit. Fleshy, slimy Gary!

#### ENOLA

_(crosstalk)_ Well, yes, as fun as--

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ Lanky, horrible Gary!

#### ENOLA

_(crosstalk)_ Okay, so this is very important. So, I'm just gonna to, um--

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ Who I'm just gonna kick, and kick.

#### ENOLA

_(crosstalk)_ I'll just-- Oh. Oh, okay. Okay, you're--

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ Do you think you're better than a David, do you? Do you, Gary?

#### ENOLA

_(crosstalk)_ Alright. So, the kicking is very important to you right now, so I'm just going to leave--

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ Think you're better than a David?

#### ENOLA

_(crosstalk)_ --and, um, have a, have a good time, yes. I will see you again soon!

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ Just gonna give you a kick! And a kick! Just gonna--

#### ENOLA

_(crosstalk)_ Lovely, lovely to see you as always!

##### [climbs back into vents]

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ And I'm gonna pick you up, and tie you into a pretzel.

#### ENOLA

_(crosstalk)_ Okay, bye-bye! Yes, byeeee!

##### [vent slams shut with a whoosh]

#### DAVID

And you're gonna be-- Okay, and you're just gonna be, 'Woah David, I'm a pretzel! I don't want to be a pretzel, David' Oh, Gary...

##### [show theme starts]
