#### IMOGEN

Rusty Quill presents: Stellar Firma.

##### [theme continues]

#### DAVID 

__[frustrated noise]__ Still not here... three! *Three* reviews in a row! __[footsteps approach]__ Three! Just... what, what is he-- what is he doing?!

##### [door swooshes open]

#### TREXEL 

_(audibly sick)_ *David...*

#### DAVID

Oh! Oh!

#### TREXEL

*David, help me.*

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ Bulbous consultant detected.

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ Uh-- oh, *no,* you are bulbous!

#### TREXEL

*David, please*.

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ Access granted.

#### DAVID

Why are you so bulbous?!

##### [bwoop of lights turning on]

#### TREXEL

*David, I have been drinking moisturiser for the entirety of the time since I was last here. I haven't let any moisture out of my body in about* [__DAVID:__ Uhh...] *16 hours, David, and it hurts.*

#### DAVID 

_(nauseous)_ Oh...

#### TREXEL

__[sobbing]__ *It hurts, David.*

#### DAVID

Umm...

#### TREXEL

*David, you have to squeeze me.*

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ Please drain your consultant.

#### DAVID

Uhh...

#### TREXEL

*David, you have to squeeze it out of me.*

#### DAVID

Okay. Okay--

#### TREXEL

*David, grab hold of me.*

#### DAVID

Right, yes.

#### TREXEL

*Grab hold of me, David, and squeeze--*

#### DAVID

Right.

#### IMOGEN 

*(crosstalk)* __[beep]__ Line manager arriving.

#### HARTRO

_(crosstalk, cheerfully)_ Oh, hello! I-- *oh.* What's... going on here??

#### DAVID

Oh, um...

#### TREXEL

*Hartro! Hartro, I can explain. I can explain. I was supposed to be on time. I learned. I learned my lesson, I*--* I promise you, Hartro--*

#### HARTRO

Why do you look so... spherical?

#### TREXEL

*I've drank lots of moisturiser and I think it's caught up with me...*

#### HARTO 

_(crosstalk)_ Oh, of course you have... ugh.

#### TREXEL

*David... David, squeeze me...*

#### DAVID 

_(crosstalk)_ Right. Okay. Three...

#### HARTRO

Wait, wait, wait. Let me get behind the chair.

#### DAVID

Three... two... one...

##### [David and Trexel strain as they squeeze out the moisturiser. It's gross.]

#### HARTRO

Ohh, it's disgusting!

##### [loud splat as moisturiser is expunged]

#### TREXEL 

_(satisfied)_ Oh... that's nice...

##### [David traumatised noises]

#### HARTRO

Oh, Trexel, what a horrible way to start things. That is *disgusting.*

##### [David whoops as he slips and falls on moisturiser, continues to make traumatised noises]

#### TREXEL

Oh, that-- Oh, he's fallen. Ah... oh, that's wonderful. Oh, I'm so flappy now! Look at all my excess skin.

#### HARTRO

What?! What on earth has made you drink moisturiser, Trexel?!

#### TREXEL

I... picked up a bit of a habit, I have to admit. I was getting some for David-- It's not important.

#### HARTRO

Oh my God, you'd be addicted to addiction if you could!

#### TREXEL

I am! I am!

#### DAVID 

_(shakily)_ I'm so gooey again...

#### TREXEL

So gooey.

#### DAVID

It's like I've just been born.

#### TREXEL

Ah, it must be nice for you, then! Remember being born?

#### DAVID

It was very-- yes, recent.

#### TREXEL

Lot's of fun. Lot's of fun.

#### HARTRO

Well, guess what? I'm not here to watch moisturiser coming out of a body. I'm-- We're here to do a review.

#### TREXEL

Yes, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

#### HARTRO

Well, I need to sit. David-- oh, you've fallen off your chair. I'm sitting here. __[sighs]__ Right. Two things I'm upset about that we need to discuss before I can even begin to review your... planet. __[slippery sounds]__ *Urghh.* Right, one. Last weekend. Ah! You were supposed to be somewhere. [__TREXEL:__ *(softly)* Was I?] Yes, in fact-- oh, I remember! You *killed* several parents and created orphans. [__TREXEL:__ Orphans...] Oh, by dumping lava all over their families. [__TREXEL:__ Yes, yes.] Do you remember now?

#### TREXEL

That is coming back to me, yes.

#### HARTRO

And I thought, oh, wouldn't it be nice to give you a chance to go and entertain the orphans in a way to, you know, make good on the horribleness that you've done.

#### TREXEL

Yes, in-- in the marmalade crèche, if I remember correctly.

#### HARTRO

Yes.

#### TREXEL

I... *did* forget.

#### HARTRO

Yes.

#### TREXEL

I did-- I *did* forget.

#### HARTRO

Yes.

#### TREXEL

I went into a vent--

#### HARTRO

You sure you didn't try to just get away?

#### TREXEL

Well-- well, uh, you know what? Hands up in the air? That's possible. But I did go into a vent, and then I *immediately* forgot why I'd gone in there, and then by the time I'd realised that I didn't know why I was supposed to be in there, I tried to get back and I was lost, and it felt like things were moving? And then it got really hot, and then-- and then really cold--

#### HARTRO 

_(crosstalk)_ You're like a very, very sad cat, aren't you?

#### TREXEL

A-- a sad cat?

#### HARTRO

Yeah, you know, they always go into ducts and hide.

#### TREXEL

Yes, Hartro, I am in many ways like a sad cat.

#### HARTRO

Oh, yeah, and you got hot and you got cold. _(gleeful)_ That might have had something to do with *me*.

#### TREXEL

What do you mean?

#### HARTRO

Hahaha. I thought, "Oh, look at my tracker! Oh, look, Trexel's not where he's supposed to be!" And I noticed that you were in a duct. [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] So I thought, I could just turn up the heat, just a *little* bit...

#### TREXEL

Did... did you heat my duct?!

#### HARTRO

Oh, oh, oh, I could just turn-- turn the air conditioning on...

#### TREXEL

Chilled my duct?

#### HARTRO

I did.

#### TREXEL

Right.

#### HARTRO

Was it unpleasant?

#### TREXEL

It was very unpleasant.

#### HARTRO 

_(feigning sympathy)_ Ooh... *sorry*.

#### TREXEL 

_(crosstalk)_ I don't have much skin on my hands anymore. Although now, I've got so much *excess* skin from all the moisturising, I could probably fold some over. So, well, you know. Comme ci, comme ça.

#### HARTRO

Well... that was very bad. But I feel you've paid your just desserts.

#### TREXEL

Paid in skin!

#### HARTRO

Yes. Ooh... sore. Right. And, oh-- problem number the two. You're late again.

#### TREXEL

Yes, I am late.

#### HARTRO

A-*gain*.

#### TREXEL

But-- but it was *because* I was full of moisturiser, and stuck in a number of narrow hallways--

#### HARTRO

But *is* that my problem? [__TREXEL:__ Uhh--] I mean, *is* that something I need to know? Like,"'Oh, is Trexel *maybe* going to drink moisturiser today, and show up late? Ah!" No, that's not normal problems! [__TREXEL:__ Sorry.] The other Design Teams don't *do* this to me, Trexel!

#### TREXEL

They don't?

#### HARTRO

No! They show up! I review planets, it's a pleasant time! We eat cookies!

#### TREXEL 

_(genuine curiosity)_ There's cookies??

#### HARTRO

*Yes!* No cookies for you!

#### TREXEL

I want cookies--

#### HARTRO

In fact, the only thing that's going in your mouth is *David's foot*.

#### DAVID and TREXEL

_(simult.)_ What?

#### HARTRO

Yes.

#### DAVID

Uhh.

#### HARTRO

David, strip your foot.

#### DAVID 

_(uncomfortable)_ Oh... hey... the one--

#### TREXEL

But he's wearing-- he's wearing a-- he's wearing a onesie! It just goes all the way around!

#### HARTRO

*I* don't care!

##### [sounds of effort as David attempts to take the (nonexistent) socks off his onesie, ripping]

#### TREXEL

Oh, he's torn-- he's torn it.

#### HARTRO

Just rip it. I don't care how he gets it off! Are you wearing socks, David?

#### DAVID

*No!* No! Of course not.

#### TREXEL 

_(hushed)_ Hartro, he doesn't like socks. Don't go into the--

#### DAVID

And-- and, so--

#### HARTRO

What, even if I say "socks"?

#### DAVID

Ah!

#### HARTRO

Wh-- socks?

#### DAVID 

_(more agitatedly)_ Ah!!!

#### HARTRO

What's wrong with socks?! __[David yelps]__ You are *so strange*, you two! Get your foot in his mouth. _(to Trexel)_ And *you* need to tell me that you will never be late again. [__TREXEL:__ Oh, okay.] _(threatening)_ *And make me believe it.*

#### DAVID

Right, ahh... s-s-sorry, Trexel.

#### TREXEL

Eh, I understand.

##### [David whoops as they put their foot in Trexel's mouth]

#### HARTRO

Don't be *sorry*. __[Trexel makes muffled noise]__ *(whispers)* Or I'll say "socks" again.

##### [Trexel muffled speech]

#### TREXEL 

_(muffled])_ *Oh, god-- what is the taste of your foot, David?!*

#### HARTRO

David, I don't believe that you're actually trying to put it in.

#### DAVID

Uh-- oh, sorry.

#### HARTRO

It's just kind of hanging around the lip area.

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ Okay. Um... Okay, okay.

__[David shoves foot in more and begins intermittently making grossed out sounds]__

#### HARTRO

I need it-- it needs to be difficult for him to talk.

#### TREXEL 

_(muffled)_ *Oughhghhh*.

#### HARTRO

There. Now, Trexel.

##### [Trexel questioning noise]

#### DAVID

_(disturbed)_ His tongue's so smooth...

#### HARTRO

What did you do.

#### TREXEL 

_(muffled)_ *I was late.*

#### HARTRO

You've been late a hundred times.

#### TREXEL

_(muffled)_ A hundred times?

#### HARTRO

An even hundred. That's why today is so special.

#### TREXEL 

_(muffled)_ *I'm sorry... for being... late*.

#### HARTRO

He's-- he's sorry for being...?

#### TREXEL 

_(more desperate)_ *For being late!!!*

#### DAVID

Oh! Eugh! Eugh, he's trying to say late, I can feel that.

##### [incomprehensible muffled Trexel noises]

#### HARTRO

Can you feel the L?

#### DAVID

Yeah.

#### HARTRO

That would be, like-- like a tongue-y... letter.

#### TREXEL 

_(muffled)_ I'll--

#### HARTRO

And-- yeah?

#### TREXEL 

_(muffled)_ *I'll never do it again.*

#### DAVID

It's like a fat slug stroking the bottom of my foot...

#### HARTRO

Okay, do either--

#### TREXEL

_(muffled)_ *I'll never be late again.*

#### HARTRO

Do you believe him?

#### TREXEL 

_(muffled)_ *Please, David, please-- David...*

#### DAVID

He's saying "please" to me, and he's not done that before, so I think he does mean it.

##### [muffled Trexel sobs]

#### HARTRO

All right, you can take it out.

##### [slurping sound of David's foot being removed]

#### TREXEL

Auughhhh.

#### DAVID

Eugh!

#### HARTRO

Now, Trexel, I don't enjoy that. [__DAVID:__ Ooh, it's so smooth. Ooh.] I'm very sorry that I *had* to do that, but you very much did it to yourself.

#### TREXEL

David... David, your foot tastes like week-old hot beef on a radiator.

#### DAVID

Um... thank you?

##### [Trexel coughs weakly]

#### HARTRO

Right, onto the planets.

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ Consultant design recommendation file.

#### HARTRO

Serafina Mouchet. Ah, that's labyrinths, and robot _(struggles to pronounce)_ gondol-- golden-- gondil...

#### TREXEL

Oh, ah-- Hartro.

#### DAVID 

_(crosstalk)_ Uh-- yes.

#### HARTRO

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Two, three, four...

#### DAVID and TREXEL

♪ Golden robot gondoliers! ♫

#### TREXEL

One for you. And one for me!

#### DAVID and TREXEL

♪ Golden robot gondoliers! ♫

#### HARTRO

Wait, what-- what-- What?

#### TREXEL

Where are they?Who are we?

#### DAVID and TREXEL

♪ Golden robot gondoliers! ♫

#### HARTRO

Okay, what are you doing? What are-- you're singing and dancing.

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### HARTRO

You made up a song?

#### TREXEL

Yes!

#### HARTRO

For this planet?

#### DAVID

The gold-- golden robot...

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ For the golden robot--

#### HARTRO

This planet does *not* deserve a song!

##### [beat]

#### TREXEL

Oh.

#### HARTRO

You did something very naughty! *You* put a little bit of IMOGEN into these robot-- Don't sing the song. __[Trexel quietly begins reciting the song]__ Don't you dare.

#### TREXEL

Sorry.

#### HARTRO

So you decided to give them a bit of IMOGEN.

#### TREXEL

Just a little bit of IMOGEN!

#### HARTRO

You *cannot* give a little bit of IMOGEN!

#### TREXEL

Just a little soupçon of IMOGEN!

#### HARTRO

*No!* IMOGEN is like... Stellar Firma Ltd.'s head. And you thought you could cut off our nose and give it to a different planet?

#### TREXEL

As you say it back to me, that *does* sound bad. Even a dumbed-down version of IMOGEN is, yes, one of the most powerful entities on the-- on-- on the face of the universe, so...

#### HARTRO

Even-- Yes! Even a speck of IMOGEN is *not* dumbed-down. 'Dumb'-- 'dumb' doesn't go in the same sentence as 'IMOGEN'.

#### TREXEL

Right, right, right.

#### HARTRO

In fact, I bet if she's-- well, she *is* listening, isn't she?

#### TREXEL

She's *always* listening!

#### HARTRO

She's *not* going to be happy about that.

#### TREXEL

IMOGEN? How do you feel about me giving a tiny part of you to a client?

#### IMOGEN 

__[error buzz]__ Watch it, buster!

#### TREXEL

Not happy. No.

#### HARTRO

No. No, so.

#### TREXEL

Okay. Well, obviously this would have been caught down the line.

#### HARTRO

*You* should have caught this! In fact, David 7, *you* should have caught this!

#### DAVID

Uh-huh.

#### TREXEL

Yes, David.

#### HARTRO

I-- Why I-- _(warning)_ *Stop it,* Trexel. [__TREXEL:__ Yes, David.] Trexel, *I* do the telling off.

#### TREXEL

Sorry.

#### DAVID

Uh...

#### HARTRO

You sit quietly.

#### TREXEL

I'm sorry.

#### HARTRO

David 7?

#### DAVID

Yes. I... was sleepy at... the time? ...Sorry.

##### [beat]

#### HARTRO 

__[sighs]__ Right. Don't *ever* let Trexel give out any bit of IMOGEN. Just... *don't* let it happen. I shouldn't need to say this. Anyway, one more thing about that last planet, the Build Team have sent something back. Apparently they didn't need it, it was broken. Anyway, here you go. [__TREXEL:__ Oh.] It's some sort of... I don't know.

#### TREXEL

It's a smashed graph friend.

#### DAVID

Oh!

#### TREXEL

David, this is Henry!

#### DAVID 

_(feigning concern)_ Oh-- oh, no. Oh, Henry.

#### TREXEL

Oh, poor Henry, smashed in his prime.

#### DAVID

Ohh...

#### TREXEL

I-- I commiserate with you, David. __[compassionately sighs]__ I know--

#### DAVID 

_(not sad at all)_ So sad.

#### TREXEL

--that a-- that a person and their graph friend, it's-- it's a bond that... that only rivals the love of a parent. I mean, obviously, *I* have Percy at home, and if anything happened to Percy like this, well, I don't know what I'd do. I'd probably just tear...

#### HARTRO

It's a *toy*.

#### TREXEL

It's a friend! It's a graph friend! You wouldn't understand, Hartro, you had other friends as a child, but me and--

#### HARTRO 

_(dryly)_ I have *real* friends.

#### TREXEL

Me and David here... we're different. We're friendless in this world.

#### HARTRO

I'm *definitely* different.

#### TREXEL

I haven't seen Percy in a long time...

#### DAVID 

_(quickly)_ Oh, I'm sure he'll turn up. Um, so...

#### HARTRO

Next planet.

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ Consultant design recommendation file.

#### HARTRO

Bathin, the Great Duke of Galactonium. [__TREXEL:__ Hmm...] And he is *great*, isn't he? Oh... I love working with him!

#### TREXEL 

_(grumbling)_ Yes, yes, yes. What about Bathin? What did he-- what did he think of his planet?

#### HARTRO

Oh, what about him? Oh yes! Oh, um, well, he's filled out a feedback form!

#### DAVID

Oh, that's very helpful!

#### HARTRO

So conscientious of him, isn't it? [__DAVID:__ Mm.] And-- well, I've got it here, and--

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__

#### HARTRO

Oh. Oh, no, it's just... oh, it's just a photo of him... with h-his autograph. __[Trexel sighs deeply]__ [__DAVID:__ Oh!] That's strange... Lovely, isn't it?

#### DAVID

It's very... Yeah-- What handsome nipples he has!

#### HARTRO

He does! And he's *strong*, isn't he? [__DAVID:__ Mm!] But it looks like he's sensitive as well?

#### DAVID

Yes, big soft arms. _(appreciative)_ Mmm.

#### HARTRO

_(crosstalk)_ Like I feel like you could talk to him if you had a problem.

#### DAVID

Maybe just lay your head on his... chest.

#### TREXEL

Is-is-is there any actual-- any actual *feedback* or is this just... pictures.

#### HARTRO

Oh, uh-- Oh, I-- I took some notes, so I'll just see the...

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__

#### HARTRO

Oh, no. No, it's just more... more photos of Bathin-- [__TREXEL:__ Oh, I see.] Oh, David 7, look at this.

#### DAVID

Is he-- is he making six cocktails at once?

#### HARTRO

How-- how could you even *do* that?

#### DAVID

I know!

#### HARTRO

__[soft gasp]__ And he makes it look-- he looks like he'd be-- it's *fun*. You know? Like, I want to go over there and... and have one of them.

#### DAVID

He's not even trying.

#### HARTRO

No.

#### DAVID

You know, it's just-- he's talking to you and-- and listening actively, at the same time as making six cocktails at once and then--

#### HARTRO

Trexel! Look!

#### TREXEL 

_(alfheartedly)_ Isn't... It's nice.

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__

#### HARTRO

And-- Oh, and look at this one! Oh, he's studying! [__DAVID:__ Mmm!] Oh, he wears glasses. What's he reading there? [__DAVID:__ Well, that adds something--] Ooh... oh, "How to Make Yourself A More Understanding Person".

#### TREXEL 

_(snappish)_ Well, *that* doesn't seem like a real book!

#### HARTRO

But it is! Look, it's right there.

#### DAVID

Well, no it's-- It's quite big. Very small text, actually, I think there's a... So it's a dense read. [__TREXEL:__ *(still slightly bitter)* Well, okay.] But he seems to be really into it, actually...

##### [Hartro sighs dreamily]

##### [beat]

#### TREXEL

So--

#### HARTRO

Trexel, why do you look so angry?

#### TREXEL

Well, I just-- _(whispered fervently)_ I just feel like we're spending a lot of time talking about how good Bathin is, when everybody in this room knows *full well* that I do not get on with Bathin.

#### HARTRO

Oh, you know Bathin?

#### TREXEL

Yes! Yes.

#### HARTRO

You know Bathin?!

#### TREXEL

I do-- You *know* I know Bathin!

#### HARTRO

Oh-- tell me about Bathin!

#### TREXEL

He's-- an-- an old school-- I'm gonna say *friend* of mine, but we didn't get on.

#### HARTRO

No.

#### TREXEL

And Bathin's a-- Well, I-- I don't want to be coarse, but in my opinion, Bathin's an idiot.

#### HARTRO 

__[offended gasp]__ Take it back.

#### TREXEL

I'm sorry, that's how I feel, Hartro.

#### HARTRO

Do you know what? He's a respectable man. He does good things. He has several charities. Do you have a charity? Do you have *one* charity? [__TREXEL:__ I don--] He has seven charities that I can think off the top of my head!

#### TREXEL

What-- what for? What are these charities?

#### HARTRO

Oh-- one charity for... people who don't know where their spaceship is.

#### TREXEL

Well, I suppose--

#### HARTRO

Do you ever have it when you lose your spaceship.

#### TREXEL

Yes. Yes.

#### HARTRO

Well, he's got something for that!

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### HARTRO

People who don't like to shop.

#### TREXEL

I-I know people hate that.

#### HARTRO

Just the other day, I didn't feel like shopping. I just called up his charity and somebody came and shopped for me. He's a lovely man. He makes the world better, Trexel.

#### TREXEL

Fine, I take it back... Bathin is a wonderful person and a valued client.

#### HARTRO

Hmm. Fair. Was that so hard?

#### TREXEL

Well, if you think he's got handsome nipples, why don't ya get a load of *these* boys?

##### [David and Hartro make shocked and disgusted noises]

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ Warning: nipples detected. Security alerted.

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ Yeah! See?

#### HARTRO

No, stop!

#### TREXEL

We've all got handsome nipples!

#### DAVID

Oh, so *dry...*

#### TREXEL

Yes. Well, since you squeezed all the moisture out of me, David, it's dry and flappy now.

#### HARTRO 

_(disgusted)_ Put it down. Put it down.

#### TREXEL

Okay. __[Hartro sighs in relief]__ I'll-- I'll hush these puppies away. So, see? Both Bathin and I have very handsome nipples, so it's not *all* his game!

#### DAVID 

_(supremely upset)_ Like tiny blue calderas.

#### HARTRO

Oh. Ergh, okay. Let's just shake that off. Uh... back to business!

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ Consultant design recommendation file.

#### HARTRO

Psilax Bromius, the party planet! Yes, yes, yes, yes. The ultimate rave in space.

#### TREXEL

Yes! The space rave.

#### HARTRO

Well, I don't know *how,* but you've actually managed to make a party that teenagers *like*.

#### TREXEL

A success! A success, David!

#### DAVID

Oh, we did well!

#### HARTRO

No, no no no, no--

#### TREXEL

We've made a party planet and people love it! Grab the-- champagne! Champagne!

#### HARTRO

No, no, no, no! It's bad! It's terrible! Because all of the teenagers in the galaxy are going to this planet!

#### TREXEL

Well, that's-- that's what we *wanted!* That's what we wanted, a super-- a super cool party with music _(sings)_ ♪ I'm scared of... do dum da dum dum.Dance now. ♫

#### HARTRO

Trexel. *All* of the teenagers are going. We're losing our youth. In fact, some of these teenagers have parents who are *senior executives*!

#### TREXEL

Oh, *no*.

#### HARTRO

It is not good.

#### TREXEL

Not good at all, no! No, we have to stop this! If-- if the senior executives get wind that all of their teens have been enticed onto my rave planet, then-- then-- then I'll never-- I'll never get another decent assignment again! We have to stop this, Hartro, we have to stop this!

#### HARTRO

You don't think I know this?

#### DAVID

We could just end the party! [__TREXEL:__ Yes!] We've got the-- Just end the party. We built that in!

#### TREXEL

We built in a party ender!

#### HARTRO 

_(crosstalk)_ If it was that simple, we would do that!

#### TREXEL

But you just-- you just press the party ending button, [__DAVID:__ The moon crashes into the--] and then a moon just *crashes* in and it turns into a *burning star*!

#### HARTRO

...Okay, do you see the problem there?

#### TREXEL 

_(muttering to himself)_ Okay, hang on there.

#### HARTRO

I-I-I'd like to just... Yes.

#### TREXEL

_(muttering to himself)_ Well, you crash... crash the moon into the-- and then burning star, [__HARTRO:__ Yeah.] and then everybody dies... _(realisation)_ every-- everybody dies.

#### DAVID

Ahhh.

#### HARTRO

Everybody, [__TREXEL:__ Everybody dies.] including very important teenagers to senior executives.

#### TREXEL

V.I.P. teens.

#### HARTRO

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Right.

#### HARTRO

So we *cannot* do that.

#### TREXEL

Righty-o. Well, in my experience, parties always end about 15 minutes after I arrive, so... __[Hartro gasps]__ so surely it-- it can't be long for this world!

#### HARTRO

That is brilliant.

#### TREXEL

What's brilliant? Have I had a good idea?

#### HARTRO

Oh my gosh, Trexel, I don't know how you've *accidentally* had so many brilliant ideas, but, you go! *You* go! Yes, oh, lovely, yes, oh, I love that.

#### TREXEL

What-- what do you mean? If I go, surely people will-- will think it's even hipper. _(imitates 'cool teen' voice)_ "Trexel's here! Look at this. Look at him. Look at that."

#### HARTRO

Trexel, I'm counting on the fact that that *won't* happen.

#### TREXEL

All right. I'll-- I'll make you a bet.

#### HARTRO

All right!

#### TREXEL

I'll go there and I'll turn up. And yes, parties do tend to end pretty quickly after I finish, but only because they're all, like, "Whoa, this party's *too* hot!"

#### HARTRO

I have an idea.

#### TREXEL

What?

#### HARTRO

Yes. Yes. You'll go this weekend.

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### HARTRO

Lovely! And *you* take off your shirt! [__TREXEL:__ Well-- wh-- wh-- sh--] Fantastic. David 7, I'm brilliant, don't you think?

#### DAVID

Oh, yes, absolutely.

#### HARTRO

'Cause it was horrible, wasn't it?

#### DAVID

The nipples.

#### HARTRO

I wanted to be away.

#### DAVID 

_(haunted)_ The nipples.

#### TREXEL 

_(offended)_ All-- all right, all right, we can all agree that my nipples maybe aren't the best, but they've got-- they've got something to offer to the world.

#### DAVID

Well, just offer them to the party.

#### TREXEL

Well, okay, yes. We'll-- we'll-- we'll take them to the masses! I'll lift up my shirt to the party and shout, "Hey teens: here's the nips!" and then we'll see what happens. Okay?

#### HARTRO

Ah, I think that's good as done!

#### DAVID

_(softly)_ Yes, settled that one pretty well.

#### TREXEL

Good. Well, I didn't have any plans this weekend so I look forward to it!

#### HARTRO

Yeah. And we know you like to party.

#### TREXEL

I love to party!

#### IMOGEN

Consultant design recommendation file.

#### HARTRO

Lorek Brynison's planet, uh, the armoured polar bears, yes. Oh come-- __[scoffs]__ that should have been so easy? Right? You just build a sphere of ice,[__TREXEL:__ Mm-hmm.] and you realise how sensitive this is! [__TREXEL:__ We did--] And you've already killed two of their planets!

#### TREXEL

Hartro, I went into this planet *so* carefully. I have *personally* caused two world deaths for these people. [__HARTRO:__ Yes.] So I made it very, very clear to David and to myself when we were designing it, that we can on no account let them know that we are even *thinking* about heating up *any* sort of ice on their planet. And I think I nailed it.

#### HARTRO

You* hid* heaters in accountants.

#### TREXEL

Who looks at accountants? Who looks at accountants?

#### HARTRO

What-- Apparently polar bears! I mean there's flesh, there's blood. I mean, that just says "tasty morsel"!

#### TREXEL

But-- but they were seals! And we made them accountants to make them less enticing!

#### HARTRO

It's still flesh, come on! Doesn't matter if your food's boring, you still eat it.

#### TREXEL

That is true. You eat mostly mush, don't you, David?

#### DAVID

Uh, yes. Yes. Slurry.

#### TREXEL

Yes. I just *drink*.

#### HARTRO

Moisturiser...

#### TREXEL

Moisturiser, mostly. Very fattening.

#### HARTRO

Hmm.

##### [beat]

#### TREXEL

So they've eaten the accountants.

#### HARTRO

They're very upset. Yes, they really-- really only had to eat one accountant, because once you eat one accountant and you realise, actually it's a heating mechanism, the-- "Oh! Oh, looks like they're going to try to kill us again!" [__TREXEL:__ Yes. So--] Right? "That old Trexel Geistman, third planet is the charm!"

#### TREXEL

Did they-- did they know it was *me* specifically?

#### HARTRO

Oh yes, they know it was you.

#### TREXEL

Ah.

#### HARTRO

Yeah. *Not* good. Oh, and guess who's reached out to them?

#### TREXEL

Uh-- is it you? Is it you with an apology on my part?

#### HARTRO

Well, of course I've reached out to them. I've smoothed it over like I always do, as best I can. But no, they don't want to see me, because now they're in alliance with the Megatrons! [__TREXEL:__ Oh...] Ha-- the other-- the *other* planets that hate us! This is not good.

#### TREXEL

Yes. To be fair, I'm not at fault for the Megatrons, that was humanity.

#### HARTRO

Well, yes, but we don't want them working together, and they are.

#### TREXEL

No. And they are.

#### HARTRO

And you are at fault for that.

#### TREXEL

And that is--

#### HARTRO

So it's twice as bad.

#### TREXEL

Okie-dokie.

#### HARTRO

I don't understand, David 7.

#### DAVID

Uh, yes?

#### HARTRO

That was an *obvious* warlike situation which Trexel created. Why did--

#### TREXEL

David, are you trying to *sabotage* me?

#### DAVID 

_(flatly)_ No.

#### TREXEL

*Et tu*, David!? [__DAVID:__ No.] A viper in my bosom! I clutched you to my breast--

#### DAVID 

_(crosstalk)_ Oh. No...

#### HARTRO 

_(crosstalk)_ Oh, hold your horses.

#### TREXEL

Like a kindly snake, and it turned out you would turn and *bite me!*

#### DAVID

Just... very sleepy... Sorry! Um...

#### HARTRO

Oh, *and*... and, you requested a particle accelerator.

#### DAVID

Uh...

#### HARTRO

Now, I think once your data's been loaded, David 7, you get--what do you have, oh... subservience... [__TREXEL:__ Subservience.] Yet right after the subservience, I think that's when they add the "don't start wars" [__TREXEL:__ Don't-- don't-- don't cause wars. Yep.] and... "don't request particle accelerators". [__TREXEL:__ Yeah, don't-- don't--] It's very clear.

#### TREXEL

Do not mess with the fabric of reality.

#### HARTRO

And yet that-- I have an alert here that's been issued from IMOGEN, that you did do that.

#### TREXEL

_(softly)_ Yes.

#### DAVID

Well... Trexel's very forceful... and __[stammers]__ I also need to support... the designer in their-- their desires, so.

#### HARTRO

You do! You need to work together. You're a team-- That's it! There's not enough teamwork going on! Ooh, that gives me an idea. Ah, yes, I know exactly what I'll do.

#### TREXEL

Right, what-- what are you going to do?

#### HARTRO

Uh, brilliant! Great! Oh, you'll see. Ah... bad job, and... planets bad, and... _(quickly)_ see you later. Bye!

##### [slippery sound as she stands, door swooshes closed]

#### TREXEL

Oh. Bye, Hartro. Bye!

#### DAVID

Bye, Har-- Okay. Um... Oh, I hope that doesn't involve feet.

#### TREXEL 

_(solemnly)_ David, it's almost certainly gonna involve feet in some way. [__DAVID:__ Oh, no.] I don't know why and I don't know how, but when Hartro Piltz has an idea and it's to do with me, it's gonna end up with a foot in my mouth.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

But she has a point, David!

#### DAVID

What?

#### TREXEL

Previously, most clones have, you know, given me a bit of a heads up about this sort of stuff. Sure, I've ignored them. Sure, they've been recycled, but they yammer on, saying, "No, Trexel, no, this is against my directives!" _(suspiciously)_ And that hasn't happened a *single* time with you.

#### DAVID

Up... graded models...

#### TREXEL

I know what's going on, David!

#### DAVID

Uh...

#### TREXEL

I know exactly what's happening here! [__DAVID:__ Wh--] You try and trick me and hide it from me, David, but I've got to the core of the idea. [__DAVID:__ Wha--?] I know what this has all been about! [__DAVID:__ What--] Weeks on weeks you've been here and now I understand it! *I need another pint of moisturiser!* That's it, isn't it?! I've got distracted, what are we doing? I'm thirsty. Bye bye!

##### [slippery sound as he stands, door swooshes closed]

#### DAVID

Ahh... um. __[nervous exhale]__ How do I fix this?

##### [show theme starts]
