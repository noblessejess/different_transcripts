##### [shorter version of the show theme]

#### SIGMUND

These are some vocal pickups for the audio of Sigmund Shankeray. __[clears throat]__ *(varying intonation)* Sigmund Shankeray. Sigmund Shankeray. __[footsteps approach]__ Sigmund Shankeray.

##### [door swooshes open]

#### NUMBER 1

Sigmund Shankeray.

#### SIGMUND

Ah! Um... can I-- can I help you?

#### NUMBER 1

Surely you know why I'm here.

#### SIGMUND

Um, I... don't believe I have a booking for a guest. Uh, who, may I ask, am I speaking to?

#### NUMBER 1

That's the first time I've ever been asked that.

#### SIGMUND

Oh, I-I do beg your pardon. If-- if you could just tell me who you are, that would be quite helpful.

#### NUMBER 1

Number... 1.

#### SIGMUND 

_(nervous)_ Ah. Of, um... of Standards.

#### NUMBER 1

I'm here to, um... test your character.

#### SIGMUND 

_(stammering)_ My-my-my character. What-- what, to see if I'm good at my job? To see if I'm-- I'm-- I'm worthy of continuing in my job as main interviewer and--

#### NUMBER 1

To see if you understand the standards.

#### SIGMUND

I-I see. Well-- well, I think I can provide that. Well-- well-- well, how-- how about we, um, how 'bout we do a-- a little interview, and I can show you how-- how well I can do my job and how well I-- I ad-- adhere to st-standards.

#### NUMBER 1

Okay. Press the record. Let's go live.

#### SIGMUND

L-Live? Not-- not a test-- No. __[stammers]__ Okay. Going live.

##### [turns radio switch on, upbeat radio show intro music, the show sounds like it is being played on a radio in a corridor at first and then transitions into sounding clearer]

#### SIGMUND

Hello, and welcome to *Executive Quarterly* with me, Sigmund Shankeray. I'm joined today by a surprise and, may I say, most welcomed guest, Number 1 of Standards. Number 1, how are you?

#### NUMBER 1

Thank you, Sigmund. I am, of course, as always, fine.

#### SIGMUND

Hmm. Fine. May-- and may I say, very fine.

##### [beat]

#### NUMBER 1

No, you may not.

#### SIGMUND 

_(nervous)_ Okay. Um, I want to, uh, start with the-- the question which I __[clears throat]__ am about to ask. Um, Number 1, what would you call your perfect day?

#### NUMBER 1

I'm glad you asked, Sigmund. [__SIGMUND:__ Mm.] My perfect day as the head of Standards is following all the standards set forth by the Board.

#### SIGMUND

Y-Yes. Of course. Obviously, yes. That-- that would obviously be the answer. Stupid Sigmund. Stupid Sigmund for not knowing--

#### NUMBER 1

Hail the...

#### SIGMUND

Hail the Board. Hail the Board. Of course, hail the Board. Hail the Board. Um-- let, let me ask you another "not stupid" question. _(haltingly)_ How do you find yourself as Number 1, head of Standards, um, how do you find it to be yourself most as perfectly good as you are?

#### NUMBER 1

How do I find it to be myself?

#### SIGMUND

Yes, l-let me put it another way. You're great. How are you... quite as great as you are?

#### NUMBER 1

Thrilling. I find that when one follows the standards as one is meant to [__SIGMUND:__ Mm-hmm.] that one typifies what the Board would want one to be. [__SIGMUND:__ Mm.] Do you?

#### SIGMUND

Uh, I-I-I do. It-- it's true. __[shifts uncomfortably in seat]__ And one plus one is two. That-- that's nothing. __[shifts some more]__

#### NUMBER 1

You look a bit uncomfortable, Sigmund.

#### SIGMUND

Uncomfortable? No, no. I'm-- I'm just sweating profusely at-- at the excitement and enjoyment of having you here, Number 1.

#### NUMBER 1

Maybe we should turn the temperature down in this... room.

#### SIGMUND

Um... Well, I-- You could-- __[Number 1 turns knob]__ Oh, there you go. Okay. Um... Yes. Well, well, how-- how 'bout this? Um, you're-- you're often, um, known to-- to have a close relationship with-- with, I believe, Number 48. Wh-Where's Number 48 at the moment? __[pause]__ Um... Are they... outside or...

#### NUMBER 1

Number 48... is looking after someone else's... "character" right now... with their hammer.

#### SIGMUND

Right. Well, in-- in many ways then I'm glad--

#### NUMBER 1

You don't want to meet... Number 48 with their hammer, do you, Sigmund?

#### SIGMUND

No! No, I-- I wouldn't-- I wouldn't like that. Not that I wouldn't like to meet a member of Standards, it's just the hammer... _(unnerved)_ The hammer. Oh, the hammer. Um... __[shifts uncomfortably in seat]__ Okay.

#### NUMBER 1

Do you think it's appropriate that Number 48 uses a hammer?

#### SIGMUND

A-- Absolutely. Um, a-anything that Number 48 feels is appropriate in-- in the pursuance of-- of their duty of-- of kinetic vengeance is-- is-- is fine by me. Fine by me, Sigmund Sh-Shankeray. H-How 'bout-- how about I ask you another question? Um, if there was any one thing you could change about your job, what would it be?

#### NUMBER 1

Do you think I need to change, Mr. Shankeray?

#### SIGMUND

Oh Board. Um, no. No!

#### NUMBER 1

Which standard in particular do you think needs to change?

#### SIGMUND

As we all know, the standards as laid out by the Board and as rightfully encouraged forcefully by Standards are all perfect, and I would-- I would never suggest that any standard in particular needed a change. I was-- I was merely asking if you were to--

#### NUMBER 1

Who do you hail?

#### SIGMUND

I hail the Board.

#### NUMBER 1

Who?

#### SIGMUND

The Board.

#### NUMBER 1

Say it again.

#### SIGMUND

The Board. I hail the Board. Hail the Board! Hail the Board. Um... perhaps, um--

#### NUMBER 1

Let me-- let me ask you, Mr. Shankeray. What would *you* change about *your* job?

#### SIGMUND

Um... I would... __[shifts uncomfortably in seat]__ like... for there to be more hours in... the day __[shifts some more]__ for me to... work.

#### NUMBER 1

Do you believe that we have overstretched you, Mr. Shankeray?

#### SIGMUND

No. No, I--

#### NUMBER 1

Do you believe that Standards does not have an accurate grasp of what you can achieve in a day?

#### SIGMUND

No, absolutely not. I think-- I think-- You know what I-- You know what I think? I think that, whilst I may sometimes feel that I would like more hours in the day, I myself am a weak and fallible being unlike the Board and, indeed, yourself and Number 48. So whatever I think about that, whatever-- whatever problem I may feel I have is-- is obviously the-- the-- the, uh, production of a weak and flawed mind, because I am flawed and weak.

#### NUMBER 1

Do you think a member of Standards could be flawed, Mr. Shankeray?

#### SIGMUND

No! No, u-unless perhaps they were pretending to be a flaw in order to surprise an enemy of the Board. No!

#### NUMBER 1

What do you believe should be done if a Standard breaks a standard? __[soft annoyed huff]__

#### SIGMUND

I-I beg your pardon?

#### NUMBER 1

What do you believe... should be done... if a Standard were to break one of the standards set forth by our Board?

#### SIGMUND

So if a member of Standards __[shifts uncomfortably in seat]__ was to knowingly break a-- __[shifts some more]__ they-- Okay. Let's, um--

#### NUMBER 1

Let's turn the, uh, turn the heat down a little bit in here. __[turns knob]__ You're sweating still, Mr. Shankeray.

#### SIGMUND

Yeah-- Well-- Yes. Um... If-- if that were to be the case--which it-- it never would be because obviously no Standard would ever-- would ever do that--um, but if it did happen--

#### NUMBER 1

Of course, if it did happen, it would mean that *I*, as Number 1, had incorrectly assessed whether someone was suitable to be a Standard, wouldn't it?

#### SIGMUND

_(quickly)_ Which is why it would never happen. It's why it would never happen.

#### NUMBER 1

But if it did?

#### SIGMUND

If a Standard broke a standard then they themselves would be... compelled to... administer kinetic correction to themselves. They would immediately realise their wrongdoing and, perhaps, beat themselves to death in the face with a... a... a shovel, a hammer, or perhaps some loose concrete.

#### NUMBER 1

What's your favourite meal, Mr. Shankeray?

#### SIGMUND

Slurry. I love slurry. I love it. It's very delicious. I would like... less slurry. No, more. I'd like more. I am fine with the amount of slurry I am allowed. It is delicious.

#### NUMBER 1

If you were to carry out, as you call it, kinetic vengeance [__SIGMUND:__ Mm-hmm.] on another... being... [__SIGMUND:__ Yes?] who had broken the standards, how would you do it?

#### SIGMUND

I would do it forcefully and swiftly upon instruction, uh, from Standards or the Board or any, uh, figure of power, uh, with, uh, the right line of command. I would swiftly--

#### NUMBER 1

What method... would you use?

#### SIGMUND

My... my bare hands. I would like to-- I'd like to feel the justice directly by-- by s-- by, I don't know, strangling or-- or-- or pushing hard into a flat surface with my own--

#### NUMBER 1

How strong do you think I am?

#### SIGMUND

__[stammers anxiously]__ Very-- very strong, I suppose. Uh, powerful--

#### NUMBER 1

Strong enough that if I were to push... someone... into one of these flat walls here, I could carry out... kinetic justice as swiftly as, uh, you have suggested?

#### SIGMUND

_(barely containing fear)_ I th-- I think you would be perfectly within your power to smear someone's face and neck into a thin paste that would, perhaps, plaster its-- __[shifts uncomfortably in seat]__ plaster its way onto a wall and-- and stay there until the replacement came and could see the previous occupant's... p-physical leavings indicating their _(voice breaks)_ wrongdoing. __[shifts some more]__ Yes.

#### NUMBER 1

You think you've... broken any of the standards, Sigmund?

#### SIGMUND

No. __[pause]__ No.

#### NUMBER 1

Are you sure?

#### SIGMUND

__[shifts uncomfortably in seat]__ Pretty sure. Pretty sure.

#### NUMBER 1

How sure is pretty?

#### SIGMUND

_(uncertain)_ Beautifully sure?

#### NUMBER 1

...Of course, if you had broken any of the standards... I would have already killed you.

#### SIGMUND

__[relieved sigh]__ Yes! Of course. __[shifts in seat]__ Yes, of course. Yeah, silly me. I would __[soft chuckle]__ already be dead. Well, that's-- that's a relief if-- if nothing else. Well... Okay. Well, it's been wonderful to have you here, uh, at *Executive Quarterly* with Sigmund Shankeray, Number 1. Uh... Uh, next week we'll be doing something with someone at--

#### NUMBER 1

Would you defy the Board?

#### SIGMUND

_(voice breaking)_ No! No. No. No, I would... I would never. I would never. I'd rather die. In fact, I would die. In fact, I'm dying right now. Well, I suppose we're all dying, but you understand what I mean. I wouldn't do it.

#### NUMBER 1

What would you do to the Board?

#### SIGMUND

I'd hail them. I'd hail them. I'm hailing them right now. Hail the Board.

#### NUMBER 1

But never...

#### SIGMUND

Never defy?

#### NUMBER 1

Always...

#### SIGMUND

Hail.

#### NUMBER 1

Never?

#### SIGMUND

Defy.

#### NUMBER 1

Always?

#### SIGMUND

Hail.

#### NUMBER 1

Who?

#### SIGMUND

_(breathless)_ The Board. __[shifts uncomfortably in seat] [soft nervous sigh]__ I hope you'll join us next time _(the show sounds like it is being played on a radio in a corridor)_ for anything else. Number 1, thank you.

#### NUMBER 1

_(pleased)_ Thank you, Sigmund! This has been most... enlightening.
