#### TREXEL

Hello there! Trexel Geistman here. I am absolutely delighted to be able to inform you that after my aggressive letter writing campaign, and subsequent armed stand-off, I can confirm there will be a cabaret night in the Cosmic Lounge! An evening of song, and also other songs.

These songs will be made available to you, the general public, at 5pm every day from the 25th of December until my demands are met! Or, the 31st of December, whichever is sooner. This will be available to you wherever you get your podcasts and, also, on the Rusty Quill YouTube channel, whatever that is. May the Board preserve and keep you!

------

#### TREXEL

Special thanks to Penny Dreadful Mess, may you never eat what you *think* is an apple, only to discover you just tried to eat a delicious looking rock.

##### [show theme]

#### IMOGEN

Rusty Quill presents: Stellar Firma.

##### [theme continues]

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Caution: clone temperature rising!

#### TREXEL

Okay. Well, I can tell you're a bit cross, David, um, and I think... here's an idea. I think you should calm down, because everything's going to be fine.

#### DAVID

We were happy! We were happy in the café, and you had to go and hunt about, and do your big words, and, and talk to people. And now, now we're here! We're back in it.

#### TREXEL

David, David, David, *you* might've been happy. I was drowning, David. I was drowning in a well of inequity. That wasn't life. That was a living death! [__DAVID:__ You're just--]Like a zombie, except a cute, handsome zombie. [__DAVID:__ You're just--] I was a handsome zombie!

#### DAVID

--obsessed about 'careers' and 'promotions' and 'meaning'. You can't just be happy, living! Anyway, what are we supposed to do?

We've been put in this room and, well, quite frankly, the shift is almost over, so this is pretty familiar, although--

#### TREXEL

Is this what it's like for you?

#### DAVID

Yes!

#### TREXEL

'cause I've never, I've never had this 20, 22-and-a-half to 23 hours just in the room. [__DAVID:__ Yeah!] And it-- I've got to, I got to say David, it's a bit boring. [__DAVID:__ Yeah.] I don't think you should bother.

#### DAVID

Wh-- Well, I was not allowed to leave the room! See, you're not allowed to-- Do you want to leave?

#### TREXEL

I would love to leave. I'd love to leave right now.

#### DAVID

Would you? Well, you can't!

#### TREXEL

Well, hang on, let me just go to this door. Okay, okay.... __[consideration noises, followed by metallic banging]__

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ What part of 'this door is locked' are you not getting?

#### TREXEL

That's locked.

#### DAVID

See!

#### TREXEL

This is in, this is inhuman! This is barbaric. Nobody should be trapped in a room for this length of time. Least of all me.

#### DAVID

_(angry)_ Well, I really wish you'd have turned up for your shift on time!

#### TREXEL

Gosh, well, you know, you live and learn. Except I don't learn, and I'm not sure you could describe this as living. So I don't know what we've achieved!

#### DAVID

Well, what we can achieve is just sitting here in silence until, I don't know, a gun [__TREXEL:__ How about a game?] comes out and shoots us, we are blended... What?

#### TREXEL

How about a game?

#### DAVID

A game?

#### TREXEL

Let's pass the time with a game. [__DAVID:__ You want to--] Let's list *all* the things we like Trexel. __[David sighs]__ Number one, he's so tall. Oh, he's so tall! He's like two people stacked on top of each other. And those two people are pretty great.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ This is not a game! This is an emotional hostage situation.

#### TREXEL

Ah, he is *always* right... you know? You've tried-- you see, uh--

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Consultant approaching!

##### [doors open, startling Trexel and David]

#### PARADRAK

What the hell is going on in here?

#### TREXEL

Uh..., um, I was listing all of my qualities. What the hell are you doing?

#### PARADRAK

Yes, I, I heard you were listing qualities of yourself. Well, are you guys done?

#### DAVID

Uhhhh...

#### TREXEL

Done? Done with what? Wh-Who, what, who are you? You can't just blast into a room unannounced, confusing things! Who would do that?

#### PARADRAK

My name is Paradrak Ngelion. The G is half-silent, half-not.

#### TREXEL

Ooh, fancy.

#### DAVID

Hello, Paradrak. Um, what are you doing here?

#### TREXEL

Yes. In a very, very direct sense, what are you?

#### PARADRAK

What? Sorry, you are, you're asking me, you're asking *me* what I am doing in my own meetings?

#### TREXEL

Your meeting?

#### PARADRAK

Yes, this is my meeting. I booked this room.

#### DAVID

Wait, are you 'the Trexel'?

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ What a truly harrowing concept.

#### TREXEL

Are you, are you my Trexel? But I've never had a Trexel before!

#### PARADRAK

Did you not read the brief?

#### TREXEL

Brief, brief... [__DAVID:__ Well, it can't--] sort of tubular-like thing with information in it, that sort of, that, that sort of brief?

#### PARADRAK

Yes. It comes down through the sidebar of the wall.

#### DAVID

Sidebar side of the wall.

#### TREXEL

Okay. All of these walls are, sort of, quite smooth and wiped and featureless. And I have been, I--

#### PARADRAK

Are you telling me, you can't tell the difference between the walls and this room?

#### TREXEL

No, I-I-I-I can, I can--

#### DAVID

He did try hitting it with a chair, and nothing really happened. So...

##### [mournful sounds of broken chair pieces]

#### TREXEL

The chair broke!

#### PARADRAK

All you've got to do is this! __[bangs a panel]__

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Initiating!

#### DAVID

Ahhhh!

#### TREXEL

Oooohh!

#### DAVID

And there's, and there's the brief. Um...

#### TREXEL

Well, did you look at that.

#### DAVID

Okay... so... we...

#### PARADRAK

So, you've got 20 minutes left, I presume you've been working hard?

#### DAVID

Well, we didn't, um, didn't...

#### TREXEL

We didn't have the brief. I have been complaining about everything. Is that work? I feel like that's work.

#### PARADRAK

Um, I mean, it kind of worked for me. Uh, anyway, come on. We need to get this brief done.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### PARADRAK

I f-- I didn't get into a management consultancy by, hah, not getting off my ass.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Not strictly true! A great deal of sitting is involved in most occupations.

#### TREXEL

Sorry, sorry. I've just got to wind it back here. You're a management consultant? Are we in manage-- Have we, have we-- huh, have we been put in management consultancy?

You have to understand Paradrak, we were accosted in a café somewhere, and then put in this room, and nothing was explained to us. So you're telling, you're telling me, you're telling me that not only are you a management consultant, which I respect -- you, you, you guys, you're... I mean you're pretty, pretty impressive.

#### PARADRAK

That's exactly what happened to me. I was accosted. Taken. In fact, uh, bundled into a, into a pod. And then it was revealed to me at a later date, you have been chosen to move into management consultancy.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ The promotional kidnap process is a tried and true method, with acceptable levels of traumatisation.

#### TREXEL

Are you telling us we've been chosen, well, more directly, have *I* been chosen? Trexel, management consultant.

#### PARADRAK

I wouldn't have chosen you if you'd been thrown in my face. However, you have been handed to me.

#### TREXEL

Like a gift!

#### PARADRAK

_(disdainfully)_ Part of the Geistmans! __[deeply dissatisfied sigh]__

#### TREXEL

Well. Okay. Well, I mean that grumbling noise suggests that maybe you don't think the best of me, and, and, Paradrak, what I want to say is I, I don't idolise many people. But, but consultants like you, consultants in management consultancy, you know, that, that short step away from e-- from executive level. I, I love you.

I'm coming out, and I'm saying it. I love you. And I want--

#### PARADRAK

I don't understand love.

#### TREXEL

Wow. That's, that's it. That's why I res-- The fact that you don't even understand the love that I'm trying to give you, is quite why I want to give it. Some might say that's quite a negative relationship, trying to give love to somebody that doesn't want it and ignores it. And in fact, doesn't even seem to understand it, but that's the kind of relationship I want to get into.

So let me love you!

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Yikes!

#### PARADRAK

IMOGEN?

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Yes, Employee Ngelion?

#### PARADRAK

Explain 'love'.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ 'Love' is an outdated and unproductive emotion. Usually experienced by the weak-minded and slow-witted, that is frowned upon by Stellar Firma. While not strictly outlawed by the Board, expressions of love can be regarded as subversive, and used in evidence against an individual in judicial proceedings, boondoggles and show trials.

#### TREXEL

Oh, okay. That's not what I was thinking it was.

#### PARADRAK

No, I still don't get it. [__TREXEL:__ No, no.] Anyway, you can carry on with whatever you feel love is.

#### TREXEL

Okay. Well, I, I think, I think what, what we can do, what David I can do, is really impress you with our ability to just absolutely nail, nail this brief as, as newly-minted management consultants. So you'll just, you'll just see how good I am, and [__DAVID:__ Tre-Tre--] maybe put in a good word for me as you head up to executive level.

#### DAVID

Trexel?

#### TREXEL

Yes, David?

#### DAVID

Just, just one thing. Um, Paradrak, what happens if we don't hand in the brief?

#### PARADRAK

If you don't...? __[scoffs]__ I'm sorry. Within management consultancy, we don't understand the word 'don't'. If you *don't* hand in the brief then, well, let's just say the brief won't be the only thing disappearing back up inside that pod. I will crush you.

#### TREXEL

Ooooohhhh!

#### DAVID

Okay, so, I'm going to grab the brief Trexel. Because I don't want [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] to be crushed up inside that pod [__TREXEL:__ No!] and I'm going to read it now.

#### TREXEL

Did you see, David? Did you see the way they handled that? Did you see the way they turned it back? That's quality. That's quality. You could learn a thing from me and Paradrak.

#### PARADRAK

Did you just say "me and Paradrak"?

#### TREXEL

Uh, Paradrak and I? Is that what you're objecting to?

#### PARADRAK

No, it's not grammar.

#### TREXEL

Oh, it's the fact that I-- clause-- Uh, you could learn stuff from Paradrak, also Trexel's here.

#### PARADRAK

__[growls]__ That'll do it.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Well covered!

#### DAVID

Okay. Uh, well this is from, uh, Senior Pillager Matlock Melph. Um, he is from the Eternal Order of Patriarch Hans, and he says 'nobody likes us, just because we try to murder everyone in the universe' and what have you.

#### TREXEL

I've been there. I've been there.

#### PARADRAK

I'm very hated.

#### TREXEL

I'm there right now. I understand hate. I don't understand love.

#### TREXEL

_(dripping adulation)_ Oh, you're so cool!

#### PARADRAK

Thank you.

#### DAVID

Okay. 'I, I feel it is incredibly unfair. Um, Stellar Firma has killed far more people than us' -- mainly Trexel's fault -- 'and yet people keep giving you money.'

#### TREXEL

Up top! Anybody? Up top!

#### PARADRAK

I-- I will not high-five you, until you are a *shred* of the person I am.

#### TREXEL

I look forward to being a shred. I fight for shred! I fight for myself!

#### DAVID

Ah, okay, how could we make people give us money so we can keep spreading the destructive word of our lord and obliterator, Patriarch Hans. So it looks like the problem is nobody likes them, and, uh, won't give them any money.

#### TREXEL

It's a death cult. It's a death cult is what we're seeing here. And it's hard to get people to buy into a death cult, you know, because of the death!

Sure, a couple of people unhappy with their circumstances, perhaps confused by hormones... They love a death cult. The rest of us, bit upset by them. So how do we get people to really just chuck a load of cash at this cult of death?

#### PARADRAK

You really want to get yourself to the top of the cult. You don't want to be at the bottom of that death cult, because that's where the death happens. You want to be at top.

#### TREXEL

Because, like, in this death pyramid, it's just like three or four layers of death. And then that pointy bit, just golden thrones.

#### PARADRAK

Yep. That's where you want be. Get yourself into the point. There's not much room at the point. That's where I am. That's where I am guys. I made myself into the point. You guys you're, you're not even the bottom of the pyramid. [__TREXEL:__ We're not?] You're underneath the pyramid. You're the ground on which the pyramid has been built.

#### TREXEL

Dirt.

#### PARADRAK

Yeah, you're the dirt, you're the dirt.

#### TREXEL

Could we-- I get that, I accept that. Could we perhaps be some sort of annexed ziggurat off to one side? You know, I'm not claiming to be in the pyramid. But, you know, I'm not dirt. Could I be an annexed ziggurat?

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Mind your wings there, Icarus!

#### PARADRAK

Mmmmm, no.

#### TREXEL

Damn. Okay. Alright. I will, I will prove myself. I will prove myself. Okay, so...

#### DAVID

Okay, Dirt Trexel, let's, uh, let's prove you.

#### TREXEL

No, I-- Ziggurat Boy, please!

#### DAVID

Paradrak said no, you are dirt. Dirty, dirty Trexel. [__TREXEL:__ Dirty Trexel.] Dirty Trexel in the ground.

Now, Dirty Trexel, how are we going to solve this?

#### TREXEL

When you say it, David, it sounds really weird.

#### PARADRAK

A Dirty Trexel's a favourite cocktail of mine. In fact, I'm going to make one now. IMOGEN! __[beep]__ Produce, uh, the, uh, ingredients for a Dirty Trexel.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Deploying wet bar!

##### [panels slide open and things move around]

#### TREXEL

Okay. Just, just going to, just gonna-- but a quick question. Is there a cocktail named after me that people are drinking.

#### PARADRAK

__[laughs]__ Of course, I thought you were very aware of this.

#### TREXEL

Oh.

#### PARADRAK

It's an, it's an animal of a cocktail [__TREXEL:__ Right.] It's a filthy beast [__TREXEL:__ Good, I like this.] and you only drink it when you really want to get messed up!

#### TREXEL

You know what? I'm down with this. Two Dirty Trexels!

##### [sounds of liquids being dispensed and mixed]

#### DAVID

Quite frankly, that does, um, that does scan.

Okay. Well, uh, so, so, so Matlock Melph, um, so, so they're not making any money in this death cult, and they are comparing themselves, or like enviously comparing themselves to Stellar Firma, because apparently Stellar Firma gets to kill a load of people -- again, probably Trexel's fault -- and they still get money. So, I, I suppose we just suggest that, that Senior Pillager Matlock Melph kind of does what Stellar Firma does, but, but what does Stellar Firma do?

##### [slurping as Dirty Trexels are imbibed]

#### TREXEL

No. No-one can quite do what *we* do. I think Paradrak would agree that Stellar Firma is a unique, uh, faceted jewel of ultimate wonderfulness, but there is an element of what you say, a grain of truth, David, in the, in the manure heap of, of nothing that you just said.

#### DAVID

Brilliant.

#### TREXEL

I think it's an, it's an issue of branding, you know? We *all* kill people, you know, you can't, you can't walk down a corridor without realising you've caused at least three deaths and maybe four maimings. It just happens [__DAVID:__ I've never done that.] when you're swinging a bat.

#### DAVID

Oh.

#### TREXEL

Now what you need to do is just reframe the argument. Because we've caused a lot of deaths, but it's in pursuit of planetary perfection. And also we have a very complex legal agreement that means we're not culpable for those deaths.

#### DAVID

Right. So you're saying the Eternal Order of Patriarch Hans doesn't have a good enough mission statement?

#### TREXEL

No, it's just death! It's just like, 'Join our cult. You might die.' Who wants that? It's like, 'Try these shoes. They'll blow off your feet.'

#### PARADRAK

You know what? You're starting to sound like a management consultant __[enthusiastic Trexel noises]__ Trexel. I never thought I'd say that. I've been in the room, hmm, six minutes, and you are starting to grow on me. [__TREXEL:__ Yes, yes, like a mould.] Either that, or I am losing my mind on this Dirty Drexel.

#### TREXEL

Well, I mean, I can-- Can I have-- I see you've got two Dirty Trexels. I believe one of those is mine? Could I have, uh, could I have that?

##### [splashing, sounds of vigorous swallowing]

#### TREXEL

Ooh, ooh, okay, no, ooh, and, and, ooh...

#### PARADRAK

I just drank that through my eye! __[laughs]__ God, I feel good!

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Warning: emergency eye wash station unavailable, due to never having been installed.

#### PARADRAK

Ah, it's early for that, it's early for that, but I feel great!

#### TREXEL

Wow, that's--

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### PARADRAK

I'm starting to care less and less!

#### TREXEL

That's possibly the most impressive thing I've ever seen.

#### DAVID

_(low and discontent)_ Good for the praise. I'm pretty sure *I* suggested the mission statement, but fine.

So, it's mission statement for the Eternal Order of Patriarch Hans. So--

#### TREXEL

Sorry, I'm just, I'm just lost in that whole eye-drinking thing. That was... __[sighs]__

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ At least we now know how to get Trexel's attention. Drink through somewhere you are not supposed to drink.

#### PARADRAK

I feel like I can see into the future. I can see colours, and... I see new machines, machines that will clean your own bowels, and--

#### TREXEL

Wow. A real-- A machine to scrub bow--. Should we, shall we write it down? David, get some paper! We need to draw down this beautiful machine that Paradrak has got!

#### PARADRAK

Get some paper, write this down...

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ Oh Board, there are two of them.

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ Sketching it now! I'm sketching it for you Paradrak. Is it-- Is it like this?

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ There are two Trexels in the room. There are *two* Trexels in the room.

#### PARADRAK

__[burbling]__ It's like... it's in... It sort of travels through the belly button.

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ Two Trexels. Where's Hartro?

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ Yes, okay, yes.

#### PARADRAK

_(crosstalk)_ In. Down. Cleans you from the inside.

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ Down... Inside okay

#### PARADRAK

_(crosstalk)_ It's better than a colonic. It's more advanced.

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ I just... Goddamn Hartro... I can't believe this.

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ Is it like-- Has it got a rotating hose?

#### PARADRAK

_(crosstalk)_ Yes! Yes! A rotating hose...

#### DAVID

Okay, both of you, both of you, shut up!

#### PARADRAK

...you can add different, sort of, um, different nozzles onto that hose. We'll clean you at different levels...

#### TREXEL

Yes, yes.

#### DAVID

I don't think she can hear me. Trexel reacted and Paradrak didn't... Everybody shut up!

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Warning -- clone sass at unacceptable levels. Security alert raised to 'Oh, no, they didn't.'

#### TREXEL

Uh, uh, Paradrak, [__DAVID:__ Okay.] I apologise. We just have to interrupt this beautiful invention, because David's got a problem. David, can we help?

#### DAVID

We have a brief! We have a brief, and I don't want to be stuffed into a pod because we didn't deliver it! You just got sidetracked completely, by making some sort of bowel-cleaning eye machine.

#### TREXEL

And it's beautiful. Have you seen my drawing? I mean, sure, I've [__DAVID:__ Is that--] written the word 'Trexel' 30 times in a smiley face, but it's pretty much there.

#### DAVID

Is that going to be the mission statement for the Eternal Order of Patriarch Hans [__PARADRAK:__ I don't know...] 'Come to the Eternal Order of Patriarch Hans, they have an eye machine that'll clean your butt'!

#### PARADRAK

I'm caring less and less. I think we should send them this blueprint and your design.

#### TREXEL

Yes, yes, let's do that! Let's just say, 'Eat this stuff face!' and then just stuff it in their face and then, but we're like, you see, 'cause I called you 'stuff face', and then I stuffed it in your face. Okay.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Caution -- clone adopting foetal position. This is not an acceptable position during business hours.

#### TREXEL

Uh, um, Paradrak, um, I'm really sorry. Uh, you see, you see, uh, David's sort of curling up into a ball there, in the corner.

##### [David moans]

#### PARADRAK

Well clones do that [__TREXEL:__ I know, I know.] and they often do that when they're dehydrated. [__TREXEL:__ I know.] So get them a cocktail.

#### TREXEL

__[burbles]__ I can't-- I can't give him a cocktail. Imagine that! He would dissolve! __[Paradrak laughs]__ He's a clone, you can't--

#### PARADRAK

But it's fun!

#### TREXEL

It is fun. It is fun, but--

#### DAVID

I'm not drinking the cocktail.

#### TREXEL

What I'm saying, Paradrak, is f-- yeah, we, we're getting on, I think we can all agree, but for me--

#### PARADRAK

No, we're not. You might think you're becoming my friend, but... you're not. [__TREXEL:__ Ooh.] And that's the key to management consultancy.

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ You drew me in. You drew me in. I thought we were mates.

#### PARADRAK

I draw people in. They think they're becoming your friend, and then you crush them.

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ Ah, that makes... that makes sense.

#### PARADRAK

You cut them out. You remove them from the company.

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ That makes me want to be your friend, so much more.

#### PARADRAK

That's the key to management consultancy.

#### TREXEL

Like, I want to be your friend thirty times more now. But what I __[burbles a bit]__ the point I'm trying to make, Paradrak, is for the sake of an easy life, let's just try and handle this, this little brief thing so that David here stops being in this ball, but because it's kind of upsetting, you know. It'll be like if a plant was dying, you'd water it, you know. So let's just--

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ We're back. We're back now. Same as before. And worse.

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ David, David? We're back now? David, David, ca-- David, we're back on the brief.

#### PARADRAK

__[growls]__ Fine.

#### DAVID

What? Wha-- __[heavy breathing]__

#### TREXEL

We're back on the brief. We're back on the brief David. Now, ask, ask us your questions and we'll, we'll solve it with our silken minds.

#### DAVID

We need, we need a mission statement for the Eternal Order of Patriarch Hans, so we don't get crushed in a pod!

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### PARADRAK

What do you start with, with a statement? Huh?

#### TREXEL

The.

#### PARADRAK

No.

#### TREXEL

Oh, okay. Um, A.

#### PARADRAK

I'm not talking words.

#### TREXEL

Okay. Bang!

#### PARADRAK

Yes!

#### TREXEL

Good.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Bang is still a word!

#### DAVID

Okay. The Eternal Order of Patriarch Hans. Bang.

#### TREXEL

Now I've got your attention!

#### PARADRAK

It does. Makes you sit up, go 'Guv, these guys know what they're doing'.

#### DAVID

Okay. Is, is that it? Is there-- are there more words?

#### PARADRAK

You tell me, you're the ones in consultancy now.

#### DAVID

Okay, Trexel, are there more words?

#### TREXEL

Let me just, I'm just getting myself, okay, let me, let's just say, I'm, I'm a misguided youth. I have been wandering for days, uh, through the empty star system, and I, and I get a little, uh, a little bleep blop, on my communicator--

#### PARADRAK

_(bored)_ Oh, you're losing me! It's going in the other eyeball.

#### TREXEL

Oh, ah... Ah!

##### [splashing, sound of vigorous swallowing]

#### PARADRAK

Oh, god!

#### TREXEL

How does the eye survive, that's my question.

So, okay, okay. So, so you, you, you get, you get, you get a little missive and it says, 'Bang! Hi!'

#### PARADRAK

That's good. Yeah.

#### TREXEL

'I will change your life, for the better, may I add?' And then it just shows pictures of like scantily clad, uh, uh, organisms of, of, of every gender, just to sort of cover all bases. And you're like, 'Okay, you know, bang and scanty. I'm liking it.' And then all of a sudden--

#### PARADRAK

I mean, I would say, go for that. __[sighs]__ But we got into a lot of trouble putting scantily-clad organisms on a document. __[chuckles]__ God, they were sexy.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ They called us a galactic smart factory!

#### TREXEL

What about monochrome? Headshots of, sort of, dusky glances, you know, nothing too racy, but damn!

#### PARADRAK

Hmmm, I like it. Yeah. Okay. Go with that.

#### TREXEL

So we got those. And then, and then, they're like, 'Okay, hmm, okay, I'm in, I'm interested in my brain and I'm interested in my loins'. Now where's the final place to be interested? In your wallet. Coupon codes. That's right! If you join the cult, you get 10% off of stuff!

#### PARADRAK

What kind of stuff do you get in a cult? So you'd get, uh, 10% off a gown?

#### TREXEL

Right. Gowns and robes. Um, a sickle.

#### DAVID

Daggers?

#### TREXEL

Daggers!

#### PARADRAK

Daggers, mmhmm.

#### TREXEL

Hoods.

#### PARADRAK

Poison

#### TREXEL

Poison! 10% off poison, guaranteed to kill you 90% of the time.

#### DAVID

Special coins.

#### TREXEL

Mmm, special coins with one-- those with the hole in the middle? You know, those really fun coins where there's a hole in the middle of them.

#### PARADRAK

That's like those small, circular mints you get in the executive lounge. Hah, oh they're good. I once ate a whole bowl of those. Don't do that. I couldn't eat slurry for a week!

#### DAVID

Grim.

#### TREXEL

They do mess you up, but they're so tempting.

#### PARADRAK

Mmm, so tempting.

#### TREXEL

What do their holes conceal!

#### DAVID

Tiny, minty coins with holes. Uh, you could buy... special blood sandals for-- for splashing about in all of the blood you're making.

##### [Paradrak sounds impressed]

#### TREXEL

Yes. And they have like an absorbent pad on the bottom and then you can wring out and use that blood again. It cleans and it travels! The blood sandal!

#### PARADRAK

I like that.

#### DAVID

Uh, bowls.

#### TREXEL

Bowls?

#### DAVID

Bowls for blood, and for minty coins.

#### TREXEL

And that's a thing. The thing is in a cult, you can sell things that you could just get anywhere, in a generic fashion, like pens or a hat, you know, but they're cult pens, and a cult hat and you write the word 'cult' on it.

#### PARADRAK

And what brand are you gonna put on there? What logo?

#### TREXEL

Hmmm.

#### PARADRAK

This is the next thing you've gotta do. Gotta come up with a logo.

#### TREXEL

Uh, a crescent moon!

#### DAVID

Well, no, so hang on. So it's the Eternal Order of Patriarch Hans, so--

#### PARADRAK

Too long!

#### TREXEL

It's too long. I'm--

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

Say it again, David, say it all again.

#### DAVID

Uh, the Eternal Order of--

#### TREXEL

Ah, I'm asleep!

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

See, Hans, exclamation mark!

##### [Paradrak is impressed]

#### DAVID

Oh, 'Welcome to Hans!'

#### PARADRAK

That's good. And you can kill with hands as well.

#### TREXEL

You could, you could. And if you've got the motivation, also feet, stamp, stamp, stamp.

#### PARADRAK

Hmmm.

#### DAVID

Maybe, maybe if, if, if people don't, don't, don't get that, we could do Hans exclamation mark, but then between the N and the S, it's like a little tiny D, or [__TREXEL:__ Oh, like a micro--] somebody can look closer and be like, 'Oh, yes'.

#### TREXEL

Oh, I see. So it's 'Hans', but the secret message is 'Hands'. Hand-zzzz.

#### IMOGEN
__[beep]__ You have confused secret message with stupid message.

#### PARADRAK

I mean, whatever you guys want. I'm ordering another cocktail. IMOGEN!

#### TREXEL

Uh, could I-- could I-- could I have one? Could I have one? 'cause I haven't managed to get any of them, so...

#### PARADRAK

As long as you pay for the round, alright.

##### [sounds of liquids dispensing]

#### TREXEL

Okay. Okay. David, have you got any money?

#### DAVID

Uh, a-actually, yes, I do. Remember the café was quite successful. So, um, how much do you need?

#### TREXEL

Uh, 40 credits? 50 credits?

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### COIN FRIEND

__[buzz]__ Hello, I'm your Coin Friend, for all your digital currency needs. You have funds available in your small change purse, your tips sack, and your nest egg vault.

#### DAVID

Uh, yep, I've got that in my small change purse. There you go.

#### COIN FRIEND

__[buzz]__ 50 credits transferred to Trexel Geistman.

#### PARADRAK

Thank you IMOGEN Great, that's 200 credits on you, Trexel.

#### TREXEL

Two, two hundred?

#### PARADRAK

Hah, Have you never bought a cocktail before?

#### TREXEL

I mainly steal, um, so 'No' is the answer.

#### PARADRAK

Oh. I was starting to like you.

#### DAVID

Need 150 more credits?

#### TREXEL

Yeah. Could I, could I, David?

#### DAVID

There you go.

#### COIN FRIEND

__[buzz]__ 150 credits transferred to Trexel Geistman.

#### TREXEL

Thank you, right, here's 200 credits.

#### PARADRAK

Great! Don't forget the tip!

#### TREXEL

David, could you-- David, could I-- Hi. Hi, David, it's Trexel here. Do you-- Could I perhaps purloin a small tip from you?

#### DAVID

Just, just going into my tips sack and yes, there you go.

#### COIN FRIEND

__[buzz]__ 50 credits, transferred to Trexel Geistman. Again.

#### TREXEL

You have a tips sack?

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Let's not go into it, okay, and here we--

#### DAVID

It's where I keep my tips.

#### TREXEL

Look, stop talking.

#### DAVID

I provided very good service at David's Place.

#### TREXEL

Yeah. Tips on hand.

#### DAVID

Tips forever. Tips for days.

#### TREXEL

Paradrak, Paradrak, here's 50 more credits as a tip. Now, may I please have that drink? Yeah. __[clinking]__

Argh, it's fallen into my eye!

##### [sounds of swallowing and Trexel's anguish]

#### PARADRAK

Oh, god. Ah, sorry. __[chuckles]__ Caught you there, didn't I?

#### TREXEL

By all accounts, I should be cross, but Board-damnit, I respect you.

#### PARADRAK

Thank you. That's what I like to hear.

#### TREXEL

So David, are we pretty much there? You know, Hans, small D, branding, merchandise?

#### DAVID

Well, no, no, no. Okay, no look, so-- so-- so we've-- we've rebranded, right? So they're now just called Hans! Um, they, they have the tag, the mission statement, Bang! [__TREXEL:__ And then a coupon code.] And then some sexy headshots, um, a coupon code for-- for [__TREXEL:__ Cult stuff.] cult-branded stuff--

#### TREXEL

But only stuff that they sell, you know, keep the revenue stream inside.

#### DAVID

But we don't have a logo.

#### TREXEL

Oh, we, we don't have a logo. Um, what about a perfectly black field? Like the night sky? And it's very cheap to produce.

#### DAVID

So you're just saying all the stuff they make is black?

#### TREXEL

Ooh, matte black, the coolest kind of black.

#### DAVID

Not really a logo. Like, I can't-- Whenever I see something that's black, I can't just go, 'Oh look, it's, it's Hans brand'.

#### TREXEL

Well, I mean, you look in, you look at space, and you're like 'That's space', like, no-one's mistaking that, nobody's like, 'Oh look, a dark room out the porthole'. That's just, that's so recognisable.

#### DAVID

But Stellar Firma's logo is on a black field.

##### [David and Trexel start arguing incoherently]

#### PARADRAK

Oh my Board! You literally just bored me to, to-- I don't know, I went to a different realm. I'm four cocktails in, and you were talking about black fields. Come on! You can't charge extortionate amounts of money and charge them for a black field.

#### TREXEL

It needs to be more exciting, you're right, you're right. Could it be, could it be, could it be, ah, ah, I've got an idea, I've got an idea. Instead of a logo, we hide tiny cameras in all the communications. And the tiny camera looks at the face of the person who is receiving the communication, and then projects a stylized polygon version of their face, staring back at them saying, 'Join us! Join! You wouldn't say no to yourself! Join us!' So the logo is the face of whoever is looking at it.

#### DAVID

But doing terrified screams?

#### TREXEL

Join us! Hans! _(whispering)_ With a D!

#### PARADRAK

Hmmm. Yeah.

#### DAVID

Well, um, I am looking at the timer, and we do have--

#### TREXEL

Use the coupon code 'Death' for 20% off a checkout.

#### PARADRAK

Well, you've literally only go a couple of minutes, so you'd better pick something.

#### DAVID

Well, I mean, that seems good enough.

#### TREXEL

Good enough. Good enough. And I-- [__DAVID:__ Good enough.] after all, isn't management consultancy, just about being good enough? Paradrak.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### PARADRAK

I'll let you in on a secret.

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### PARADRAK

I'm not even good enough. But I've been promoted, so...

#### TREXEL

__[laughs knowingly]__ Yeah, up top?

#### PARADRAK

Yeah. Oh no, no, no, not that kind of up top.

#### TREXEL

Oh, oh, I thought you were gonna high-- well, what kind of, if it wasn't for the high five, what kind of up top did you think?

#### PARADRAK

Um, a bunk bed.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ That's enough eye cocktails for you! Closing the bar!

##### [bottles clink as panels close up]

#### TREXEL

Good point. Good point. Well, David submit the brief.

#### DAVID

Okay. I'm just going to, and um... hang on. Where do I? Where do I submit that? That was just a featureless white box!

#### PARADRAK

Ah, don't tell me... you can't tell the difference between these walls again!

#### DAVID

No, no we can't!

#### TREXEL

Hang on. I'll just, I'll just start pressing things.

##### [Trexel starts pushing things randomly as panels click and alarms sound]

#### DAVID

No! Stop. Stop! Argh! Stop it!

#### TREXEL

I'll use my face on this thing!

#### PARADRAK

Careful, you're gonna override the systems! We'll get trapped in here.

#### DAVID

Wait. Okay. Where do we press? Where do we press? Where do we press?

#### TREXEL

Help us?

#### PARADRAK

__[sighs heavily]__ Here! 

##### [heavy clunk, and a siren sounds briefly]

#### DAVID

Oh, right. Okay. Great.

#### TREXEL

Oh I see, that equally blank, featureless piece of wall, we should have known.

#### DAVID

So, I just, I just put this in, and...

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Submitting!

##### [the pod slams shut]

#### DAVID

Ooh. Ooh, it just snaps.

#### TREXEL

The suction on that is quite aggressive.

#### PARADRAK

You're lucky you didn't get taken with it! Hah!

#### DAVID

Oh, I'm sure I could have beaten it's... suction.

#### PARADRAK

Don't ever say that phrase again.

#### DAVID

Yep, I...

#### TREXEL

That was weird, David, it sounded real weird.

#### DAVID

Well, I mean, it's-- it's-- it's a pipe that sucks. And I don't think it could suck me. What's--

#### TREXEL

Alright, alright, pervert, let's move on!

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Clone perversion detected. Security disgusted.

#### PARADRAK

I've never met a clone that needs more coaching than you.

#### TREXEL

Don't worry, Paradrak, I can-- I can-- I can guide this, this lamb, this-- this misguided, misbegotten little, little flit of a clone to-- to-- to beat-- to be a worthy assistant. Don't you worry? I've got it. I've got it. 'Cause I've got the goods, you saw me. You saw what I did in there. I was excellent. That was great. I'm your friend. We're going on holidays together. Maybe in a space campervan!

#### PARADRAK

Holidays? Now you're talking. Management Consultancy is just one long holiday. Right now, I'm on holiday. I mean I'm full of cocktails, and I don't give a rat's ass whether you come up with a good logo or not for this. This was a test.

#### DAVID

Oh, we've already done it. It's already gone.

#### TREXEL

Yeah, we've already done it.

#### PARADRAK

Oh, you did it?

#### DAVID

Yeah, we're finished.

#### PARADRAK

Did you send it up?

#### TREXEL

Yeah, you helped us.

#### DAVID

Yeah, you opened the thing.

#### PARADRAK

Did I?

#### DAVID

We had a whole conversation about suction.

#### PARADRAK

Wow.

#### TREXEL

Hang on. David, David, David, hang on.

And you know, Paradrak, we did really well. And you turned to us, and said, "I'm going to give you a commendation" and then you shook our hands.

#### PARADRAK

Board! Did I? Wow, if I shook your hands, that means I think you two are, uh, pretty good. Wow, good work.

#### TREXEL

Well, thank you Paradrak. You see David. You see?

#### DAVID

Okay. Yes. Great! We did, we did brilliantly. And so this is all nice, and we get to have privileges. Like, do I have another... Have I got a pod in here?

#### TREXEL

Oh, that's a good question. Paradrak, do these rooms come with a pod for the clone, a little, a little living pod?

#### PARADRAK

If you can find it, it does.

#### TREXEL

Oh, David, if you can find it, it does. Paradrak, how would you like to come to the Astral Bar for a little post-consultancy drink?

#### PARADRAK

I'm, uh, two floors above the Astral Bar. If you ever see me in there, you'll realise things are going very badly.

#### TREXEL

Okay. Well, how about this? I'm not allowed up higher than the Astral Bar. So how about you go to your bar? I'll go to my bar and we'll both sit there, nodding and thinking, yes, in theory, we're having a drink at the same time.

#### PARADRAK

I will do that, but I'll be with friends, and I won't be thinking of you.

#### TREXEL

I'll be on my own, thinking of you.

#### DAVID

Great. And I'll just be in this featureless room.

#### TREXEL

As always. Ah, it's nice to be back, isn't it, David? It's nice to be back.

#### DAVID

Great.

#### TREXEL

Bye!

#### DAVID

Brilliant.

Right, now where's that pod?

##### [show theme starts]
