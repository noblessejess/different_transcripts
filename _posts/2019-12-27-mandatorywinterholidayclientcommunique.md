#### TREXEL

Dear valued client, holiday greetings from all of us here at Stellar Firma. We do hope you're enjoying your new planet/star/rogue astronomical body or maybe expanding cloud of irradiated waste. Delete as applicable. We hope this message finds you well and in a non-litigious mood. But, if you are in any way dissatisfied with your purchases, then you should check the small print and note your total lack of consumer rights in the matter. 

But I digress. Every time we reach this point of what we choose to call a year, we like to reach out to our friends and, more often than not, *foes* across the galaxy to find a moment of connection and togetherness within, but not exceeding, the boundaries of our standard service level agreements. 

In certain cultures of old Earth, we humans would distract ourselves from frostbite, food shortages, and *gaping social inequality* with bright decorations, one-off entertainment specials, and, for some reason, an enormous amount of tangerines. Some cultures would have other festivals dedicated to things like light and fertility and that sort of thing. But these winter festivals consumed by far the most stuff, and so, by any sane measure, must have been the best. 

Noel, yuletide, Christing-mas. These are all unintelligible words that we found on charred pieces of card in one of the few surviving supply crates that made it off the planet in those confusing final days. What could they mean? The question has remained throughout the centuries, largely because we don't care. 

But, also on those cards, we see a figure. Some say it's a jolly man, a cheerful spirit of giving. Bowls of jelly is somehow involved. But others, others see a threatening presence. Gifts in one hand, yes, but hardened fossil fuels in the other. Perhaps a dark portend of a then unimagined environmental apocalypse bearing down on the rapidly dwindling past! 

The important thing is the kids loved him. And that love is what we employee citizens of Stellar Firma are mandated to convey to you today. Whilst we may no longer have seasons, given that we live on a tidally locked space facility, our benevolent Board take this time of year to force us to pause and reflect on the past and look to the future. Turning off the heating units to get that __[the message begins to sound like it is being played on a speaker in a corridor]__ authentic frostbite feel of an old Earth winter. 

So I hope, with a fraction of the as-- __[error buzz]__ that I can muster the will to give, that you are happy, well-fed, and well-rested. Unless you're Bathin, in which case you can shove it right up your--!
