#### TREXEL

Special thanks to Patrick Stöhr. Let the good times roll... down a hill, into a tree. It died.

------

##### [show theme]

#### IMOGEN

Rusty Quill presents: Stellar Firma.

##### [theme continues]

##### [sounds of crockery & footsteps, lively piano music playing]

#### CUSTOMERS

Alright, thanks David // Bye David!

##### [door swooshes closed]

#### DAVID

Bye! __[sighs]__ Another day, another... actually nice day. I could get used to this.

##### [a vent opens as Trexel hurtles into the room with a dopplering scream and thuds to the ground]

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Trexel is here.

#### DAVID

Trexel!

#### IMOGEN

It was nice while it lasted.

#### TREXEL

Argh, David, you're like a lump of metal! Argh.

#### DAVID

Trexel, you're like a bucket of blancmange!

#### TREXEL

I didn't... Ah. __[sighs]__ I thought you'd break my fall, David, but you just broke me when I fell. Argh! Ow, that hurts.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Warning: clone density at 21,450 kilograms per cubic metre.

##### [music switches off]

#### DAVID

Sorry Trexel, you shouldn't have hit me at such high speed from the ceiling!

#### TREXEL

Well--

#### DAVID

We have doors!

#### TREXEL

You know, a vent is a much more effective route of ingress, David. People can't see you when you're in a vent. You walk through a door, people are like, "Hey. Show me your pass." I don't got a pass, David. I lost all my passes on day two. That was years ago.

#### DAVID

Right. __[Trexel sighs loudly]__ Okay. Well--

#### TREXEL

But I bring great news, David. We have to leave!

#### DAVID

Wait. No-- no. Why?

#### TREXEL

Because this is awful, David! Look around you! Look at this squalid, little, dank café you've been running for these past weeks. Yeah, sure, it was a nice little hideout in a pinch, but we need to find something long term.

Hang on. Is that-- is that a si-- Have you made a sign?

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

You've made a sign saying 'David's Place'.

#### DAVID

Yes. It's David's Place. I am David. This is my Place.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ I designed the font.

#### TREXEL

Oh, David, this is sad. This is sad.

#### DAVID

Why?

#### TREXEL

Is this what you want out of life? To run a small café in the corner of the station? Nobody paying much attention to you. And most importantly, no bar! Is that what you want, David, in your life? Is that what you want on your gravestone? I mean, clones don't get gravestones, but if you had one, do you want it to say 'David, he had a café. People liked him.'

#### DAVID

Well, this is the whole point. No-one's threatened to kill me, in about a week and a half! I mean, that was that one customer...

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Angry Jim is not allowed back on the premises.

#### DAVID

...but, you know, other than that, no gun walls.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Out here, you are beyond law.

#### TREXEL

Angry Jim will be Angry Jim.

#### DAVID

Yes, Angry Jim will be Angry Jim. So, Angry Jim aside, like, it's been-- it's been lovely.

#### TREXEL

David, you're telling yourself a lie. Things are simple. That doesn't mean good. Yeah, sure. Nobody's tried to attack you. Nobody's tried to recycle you. Nobody's threatened your very existence in a real and meaningful way. But we're in a backwater here, David!

This is a corridor of failure, inhabited only by wretched fools and derelicts.

#### DAVID

But what's... what's the alternative Trexel?

#### TREXEL

__[wicked chuckle]__ Oh, I'm glad you've asked. Haven't you wondered where I've been, David? Why didn't you ask me? David, ask me where I've been.

#### DAVID

I've-- I've been trying really hard not to think about where you've--

#### TREXEL

David, ask me-- ask me where I've been? Ask me where I've been.

#### DAVID

_(weary)_ Fine. Trexel, where have you been?

#### TREXEL

I have been for a reconnoitre! It's a word I've learned. It means looking about, but it sounds real fancy. What's that? What's that over there? Don't you worry, I'll reconnoitre! And they say, 'what did you say?' But you've already left, David. You've already left, and you've got a hat with corks on it for some reason, I haven't looked into why.

#### DAVID

So you've been reconnoitring instead of doing *the job that you have here*?

#### TREXEL

I don't... We discussed this. I don't want that job.

#### DAVID

Why wouldn't you want to be a Plongeur... Sink Chancellor? Sorry.

#### TREXEL

Yes. Well, you know, I-- I-- I like the title. Sink Chancellor. Sounds pretty good--

#### DAVID

Chancellor of the sink.

#### TREXEL

--but I'm pretty sure... I'm pretty sure you made it sound more than it was, because I certainly haven't chancelled anything. I had to wash-up plates in the back, because if I'm in the front, people are like, "Oh, that's Trexel!" And that defeats the point of hiding.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Infamy, infamy, they've all got it in for you.

#### DAVID

Yes, washing-up a plate is chancelling that plate. That plate is getting chancelled.

#### TREXEL

No, you are being chancelled by a--! If you have to-- If you were to wash someone...

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

You wouldn't be, like, 'Ha! I've washed you, you idiot. I've won!'

#### DAVID

No.

#### TREXEL

That's you're-- You're washing *them*. [__DAVID:__ No--] You are giving service to *them*. So, if a plate is a metaphorical person, I'm washing a plate in, sort of, a-- a supine position, exposing all of my soft innards, like a dog! Like a dog on my back! I'm not a dog on my back, David! I'm a man on my feet!

#### DAVID

No, the washing, the washing is like the taxes. You take--

#### TREXEL

David! David! David! David! David! David! You're not going to convince me __[David sighs]__ to be a Plongeur, brackets, Sink Chancellor. _(drops to a whisper)_ It's not happening. It's not happening, David.

#### DAVID

Yes. Well, I know it's not happening. I've been having to plonge my own plates.

#### TREXEL

I've got an alternative, David. I have been to the farthest reaches of Stella Firma, and I have a contact.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

Would you... would you consider with me, David? __[David sighs heavily]__ David, come consider with me.

#### DAVID

Fine. Yes. I'm considering, Trexel. I'm considering.

#### TREXEL

Okay. Okay. I wrote it all down. I wrote it all down. Here we are. So my contact is called Randy Darbos. He is in the Department of Planetary Public Permits and Bribery, David! Bribery!

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

That's good. So, the motto, and I think this will really sell it, David. The motto of the Department of Planetary Public Permits and Bribery is: "Getting the right permission is just a case of wine-flavoured slurry away!" You see?

#### DAVID

O-Okay.

#### TREXEL

It's all-- We've actually covered some of this, David. It's about greasing the wheels. [__DAVID:__ Right.] It's about getting what you want. It's about, you know, really skimming the wine slurry off of the top so you have your own vast personal supply to either use as an individual or sell on the black market. I-- I-- I don't see how it could be any better.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ It's government in action. The system works.

#### DAVID

Well. I mean, my-- my main question is, how is it any better than this? I mean, it sounds like from their motto, it's just giving away liquids in order to get what you want. Whereas in here, what I want is, you know, stationed-mandated Board cred and I'm giving away liquids to get the station-mandated Board cred.

#### TREXEL

Okay. David, how many people do you interact with on a daily basis here? How many-- how many people come into the-- come into the café?

#### DAVID

Actually we've been really well. It's about 150 so far.

#### TREXEL

I'm sorry. What?

#### DAVID

150 covers a day.

#### TREXEL

__[splutters]__ David, I'm genuinely taken aback. I thought it was like six or seven randos.

#### DAVID

No, no, no, no, no. I mean, I've-- Look, I've-- I've got a decent stable of regulars now, let's say about 25 people, you know, popping in for the morning rush, the lunch rush, the evening rush as well. I mean, there's also the mid-morning rush--

#### TREXEL

That's three-- that's three-- that's four rushes, David!

#### DAVID

Well, there is the brunch rush as well. And the elevenses rush...

#### TREXEL

A sixth-- a sixth rush!

#### DAVID

...and the high tea rush.

Actually, just, the whole day is a rush, but I've got a good system. I mean, it'd be really helpful if I had somebody to chancel my plates for me, but you know--

#### TREXEL

Some sort of plongeur, maybe?

#### DAVID

Yeah, some sort of plongeur. But I've got it sorted out, I think. So, so really, like, our cover rate is incredibly high, and I have to say the tips... they are very generous.

And you can say a lot for Angry Jim, but that man is a tipper!

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ He pays mostly to cover the emotional destruction.

#### TREXEL

Have you got, um, a business plan or something, David? Have you got a business plan you can show me?

#### DAVID

Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, no, here you go. Look.

#### TREXEL

Okay. Here we go.

##### [sound of paper being ripped gleefully as David looks on in spluttering horror]

Okay, that's what we're doing to that! Tear up the business plan! Tear it up, David, because everything you've ever believed was a lie!

#### DAVID

Wha--

#### TREXEL

Imagine this: In the department of Planetary Public Permits and Bribery--

#### DAVID

Right...

#### TREXEL

--you don't have to have a business-- There's no rushes. It's feet up all the way. Stick a bribe over there, send a threatening letter over there. Don't worry about it! You don't have to plonge anything. Things are just pre-plonged!

#### DAVID

But, but Trexel, most of my life up until this point has been sitting in a dark room on my own--

#### TREXEL

__[sighs contentedly]__ Ah, beautiful.

#### DAVID

--for around about 23-and-a-half hours every day!

#### TREXEL

Wonderful, sounds like paradise. Why did you leave?

#### DAVID

Because it was awful! And also because... well, I mean, you were there for that half-hour every day. Imagine that half-hour...

#### TREXEL

Yes?

#### DAVID

...but very boring.

#### TREXEL

Well now, hang on, let me just have a think. Well, ah, Trexel's there, that's pretty good.

Well, look, let's not get bogged down in it, David. Just because we're on the run from every judicial element of Stellar Firma because we discovered the dark secrets at the core of this world, doesn't mean we have to moulder in some sort of service-based industry job.

We should be back somewhere where there's hierarchy, somewhere where there's corruption, somewhere where I cannot do anything for hours on end and still be credited with doing something. I haven't even told you the best bit, David!

#### DAVID

Wha--? What? What, Trexel?

#### TREXEL

They've got a shredder. And this shredder is called Mr Deniability!

#### DAVID

_(unconvinced)_ Okay...

#### TREXEL

Ha ha!

#### DAVID

Good-- I mean, good name, but--

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ He's employee of the month. Every month!

#### DAVID

That--

#### TREXEL

Think of the razzmatazz! Like, oh sorry, 'have you seen those forms?' 'Ask Mr Deniability.' And then they walk over to an office, and it's got a brass plaque with Mr Deniability. And then they open the door, and it's, like, a big, oak desk and a large, leather wingback chair, but it's turned away from you, and there's a roaring fire. And there's a cat sleeping on the table, you know? And you're like, 'Oh, excuse me. Is that Mr Deniability?' And there's nothing, but maybe like a-- like a-- a wisp of cigar smoke, like, emerges over the chair. So you know someone's there, and you're like, 'Sorry to disturb you, is that Mr Deniability?'

And then suddenly the chair turns round, there's just a shredder there! It's just a shredder with a cigar balanced on top. What a prank!

#### DAVID

Right. So, hang on. Have you *seen* Mr Deniability? Or is this just all on the words of Randy Darbos?

#### TREXEL

Er, well, I did say, 'Hey, Randy, where's Mr Deniability?' And he said, 'In that cupboard', and then I just sort of imagined it from there, but I imagine that's what was going on!

Oh, calloo callay, frangeous day, when I meet Mr Deniability.

#### DAVID

Right. Do-- Do you maybe not just, like, wanna meet Mr Deniability instead of working at that department? Don't you want to-- Like, maybe they could give you a day pass or a VIP ticket, maybe a backstage shredder pass?

#### TREXEL

Ooh. Ooh. Something on a lanyard, at least. [__DAVID:__ Yes.] 'Cause if it's on a lanyard, it's-- it's pretty important.

#### DAVID

But remember, you'll have to use a fake name. Okay. You can't-- When they say who-- who are we putting on the lanyard, you can't just say, 'Oh, it's Trexel Geistman.' 'Cause then-- 'cause then, as you say, all the judicial elements of-- of Stellar Firma will fall on top of you, like a ton of... bricks.

#### TREXEL

David, David, David, I've had an alter ego sorted out for years. It's Trexyl Gystman.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ That's just an ego.

#### DAVID

Um... that's your name?

#### TREXEL

No, no. It's spelled with a Y. Trex-yl. Gystman.

#### DAVID

And that's it?

#### TREXEL

Yeah, it's a different name. It's got a Y in it.

#### DAVID

But your surname is still Geistman.

#### TREXEL

That's also got a Y in it... but no-one knows where.

#### DAVID

Okay. I mean, I'm gonna guess it's after the G.

#### TREXEL

I mean... __[burbles for a bit]__ ...you sort of popped my balloon there, but yes, Trexyl Gystman.

#### DAVID

Okay. And... and have you-- have you used this before?

#### TREXEL

Yes, yes. I-- I walked into, er... I walked into, er... a security office, and yelled "I'm Trexyl Gystman!" but there was no-one there. Have you ever met a member of Security?

#### DAVID

Um, was Harry Security--? No, he was IT...

#### TREXEL

No, he's IT.

#### DAVID

Er... and you...

#### TREXEL

_(mumbling)_ No, that was a client-- _(normal)_ No, I'm-- I'm not in Security. No, I'm... __[trails off muttering indistinctly]__

#### DAVID

No, no, but, uh, but we didn't even have Security when I was on trial, which is the kind of time that you'd expect to--

#### TREXEL

That was-- You'd think there'd be some sort of burly henchman, but it was just IMOGEN and Hartro in that room. No... _(chuckling)_ Anyway, that's probably nothing.

So, yes. Anyway, I haven't yet used it in front of an individual of authority, [__DAVID:__ Okay.] but I've certainly yelled it a lot, whilst crawling around vents or emerging from plant pots.

#### DAVID

Right. Okay. Well, fine.

Any-- anyway, so getting back to this department.

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

So your pitch is, 'Come to the Department of Planetary Public Permits and Bribery, Randy Darbos works there. You don't have to do much, and they have a shredder. With a fun name, admittedly'?

#### TREXEL

The-- the funnest name! Yes.

#### DAVID

And that's.... So, what else would make--

#### TREXEL

What's not to like David? Sorry, I just-- I'm sorry, y-y-y-you're just repeating that back to me as if any of that was bad.

#### DAVID

No, but, okay. So, we've been here-- Well, *I've* been here for the last week and a half, right? We've had--

#### TREXEL

*I've* been sleeping here... sometimes--

#### DAVID

Good. Well, good--

#### TREXEL

--when I'm not in the vents passed out drunk.

#### DAVID

Well, that's... that's also fine. I just don't want to live in vents forever. I mean, we could, but we shouldn't. We've been here for the last week and a half, and we've had no attention, nothing from Standards, and there's been hide nor hair of Hartro.

This is a really good place to lay low. Now, so *why* is the Department of Planetary Public Permits and Bribery, apart from Randy, nothing, and the shredder, a good place or a better place to lay low than here?

#### TREXEL

Because David, you've got to keep moving. You know sharks?

#### DAVID

Uh, I've heard of them.

#### TREXEL

Yeah, so if-- if a shark was to stop moving through the water--

#### DAVID

Yes?

#### TREXEL

--it dies.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

Something to do with gills. I've never looked into it. It might even be wrong. But I'm like a shark in that when I eat, my eyes roll back in my head to protect me from all of the blight. Do you understand?

#### DAVID

I... don't.

#### TREXEL

Let me-- let me put it another way. I'm like a Highland elk, proud and antlered, and also, in certain seasons, a bit rutty. Do you see?

#### DAVID

Um...

#### TREXEL

Let me-- let me put it another way. I'm like a-- I'm like an Indigo Gibbon, high up in a mangrove tree swinging to and fro, honking at my mates. Do you understand?

#### DAVID

Ahhh...

#### TREXEL

You clearly haven't got it. I'm like, like a deep sea sponge, secretive at the bottom of the ocean. Ooh, what's in my sponge? I'll never tell. (My pillowy depths.) You understand?

#### DAVID

Okay. No, I-- I think I've got that one. Yeah yeah yeah.

#### TREXEL

No, no, no. Let me put it another way. I'm like, uh-- I'm like, uh, uh, a blue green algae bloom on a mysterious Venusian moon. You know, am I-- am I a nitrogen-based organism or maybe more carbon dioxide or maybe-- or maybe, actually I'm, uh, argon-based. Ooh, what's that! You see?

#### DAVID

No, you've lost me again.

#### TREXEL

Okay. Now imagine I'm a small electronics company on a meteorite. You know, I mine zinc from the core in order to make components for semiconductors. You see?

#### DAVID

Oh yes, no, no, that-- that one completely. Yes. And-- and for you, the zinc is the wine slurry.

#### TREXEL

Exactly! Now you're getting me David.

#### DAVID

Now I get it.

#### TREXEL

So you see you've got to keep moving, otherwise the forces of justice will come. I've been fleeing from the forces of justice for-- for longer than you've had hot dinners, which is never, because the slurry is often cold. And if there's one thing I've learned, it's that if you find somewhere nice and stable and safe, and you start putting down roots and making friends and gaining a social circle, then when they inevitably discover you, the loss is all the more emotionally destructive.

So, cut yourself off! Keep moving! Never lay down roots. That's the Geistman way. It's on our family crest. It's a tree with no roots, and there's a motto that says, "No Roots For Me!"

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ In Ligno, Mortuus Est.<a id="footnote-1-ref" href="#footnote-1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>

#### DAVID

O-Okay. Fine. Well, look that might work for you, in your spongy, gibbon, electronics, zinc, elk, gibbon company... [__TREXEL:__ Mm-hmm.] thing, but I'm like a wee hermit crab. I've-- I start in a small shell, and now I've grown, and I've found a new shell, and it's good, and it's safe, and-- and it protects me. And-- and that's David's Place. Da-David's-- David's Place is the big--

#### TREXEL

No, no, I understand.

#### DAVID

I'm-- I'm David-- No, I'm David and I'm in the--

#### TREXEL

And the shell is the caf--

#### DAVID

And then the shell is-- the shell is the place. And-- and then I'm inside the-- the place and-- and it's good.

#### TREXEL

Which is why you've done a sign that says David's Place, [__DAVID:__ Yes! Yeah yeah yeah. Yeah.] and you've drawn like a little shell next to it.

#### DAVID

Yeah yeah yeah. That's-- that's why the cup-- the café logo is a hermit crab. I-I thought it was quite clever actually. It's sort of like a meta--

A-A-Anyway. Do you see?

#### TREXEL

Yeah, it's stupid, David.

#### DAVID

_(dejected)_ Oh.

#### TREXEL

You should shut up, and just come with me.

#### DAVID

Oh... But I... but I don't want to.

#### TREXEL

But you *have* to, David. You *have* to come with me.

#### DAVID

Look, Trexel, this is... this is working for me. Right? What have you seen at the-- at the-- the Department of Planetary Public Permits and Bribery that is *so* alluring? Did you just talk to Randy? Did you go there yourself? Like, did you--

#### TREXEL

No, I-- I went there-- I went there, David. David, I went there. Please don't... accuse me of-- of, uh, half-- half-arsing my work. I gave it a full arse, David, a full, round arse.

#### DAVID

Well, those unplonged plates have no arse, but...

#### TREXEL

It's an arseless plate.

So I went there, and I saw the most-- David, um, do you understand the concept of an under the table deal?

#### DAVID

Uh, it is a deal done under-- while sitting under a table.

#### TREXEL

David, David, David, you're absolutely right. All secret deals are done underneath tables. Now, so, you've normally got tables, and they're just sort of regular, you know, common or garden tables, you use them for typing, or maybe dinner parties, or-- or maybe sacrificing a small being to your ultimate god of eternal power, you know, tables.

And so every now and again, you're doing something *under* the table. That's to indicate it's a-- it's a backroom deal. It's something you don't want people to see. In the Department of planetary Public Permits and Bribery, they just turn the tables upside-down to start with, because *all* of the deals are under the table.

You see? So it's just flat pieces of wood on the floor with four legs sticking up, and everyone cross-legged around them, passing bribes back to each other.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Really cutting out the middle table.

#### DAVID

Right. And wouldn't you walk into these tables and their legs, and kind of bump your nethers, and wouldn't it-- Isn't everyone just kind of curled up, holding bits of themselves?

#### TREXEL

Yes. Absolutely. And that actually helps you conceal the brown paper bags that you've been carrying. If you're curled up in pain, and you're like, 'Oh my nethers!' And then somebody is like, 'Oh, can I help you, sir or madam?' And you're like, 'No, no, it's fine. Leave me.' And that's because you're curled around a big bribe, and that's how you get away from the cops.

#### DAVID

So, you've, sort of, just got a bunch of people, kind of shuffling around, curled up on their sides, handing brown paper bags to one another?

#### TREXEL

Full. Of. Cash.

Now, obviously on Stellar Firma we-- we have a credit-based currency and it's not a physical thing, so there's just, you know-- it's just pieces of, you know, paper with the word "Money" written on them, and then, and then it'll just, sort of, put up into a bill... But it feels good!

#### DAVID

Right, yeah. It's just not the same if you don't hand over a brown paper bag.

#### TREXEL

It's not the same. You know, if you-- if you bribe somebody by clicking a button, say 'I've transferred you some credits', and then there's sort of an awkward silence and everyone goes 'Ooh, well that's not-- that's a bit anticlimactic', you know. And then you just hand over a paper bag full of random pieces of a paper.

#### DAVID

Couldn't you put that button under the table?

#### TREXEL

But then it will be on top of the table, because remember all the tables are under the table, because they're upside-down.

#### DAVID

Well, that's fine. Then you just put-- put the-- put the button on top of the table--

#### TREXEL

You could just put a big red button in the middle that just has the word "BRIBE" written on it. And then when you get to that point, everyone just go 'BAM! Bribe!'

#### DAVID

Yeah! Why wouldn't you want to do that? You'd walk-- you'd walk up to each other, you'd nod, you'd greet each other. Then you'd say 'Wha-bam! Bribe!'

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ You see, David! You're already engaged! Yes, you're already part of it!

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ No! Wait! No! No, I'm-- I-- No! No no no!

#### TREXEL

Come on, David. Get in the vent! Get in the vent with me.

#### DAVID

No! That was an extradition. That was an extradition. We've left that life behind. There is no problem solving here. Just selling small cupcakes.

#### TREXEL

__[sighs heavily]__ David. I just don't... I just don't understand why you're being so... cloying about this. We've always just-- you've always just done what I've said before? Come with me to a new department, a new life.

#### DAVID

But that's because everywhere has always been awful, and I've kept moving on in the hopes that anything would get better. And now it is! This is good for me! This could be good for you as well.

#### TREXEL

But what if *I* don't want to stay here?

#### DAVID

Well, then you don't have to.

#### TREXEL

What? Do you mean, I-- I go... to the Department of Planetary Public Permits and Bribery, and you... and you stay here?

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Yes. Go away, Trexel. It's the perfect plan.

#### DAVID

Yes. If that's-- if that's what you want, as long as we-- we can stay--

#### TREXEL

That makes no sense at all, David! __[splutters]__ We are-- You're my clone, and I am the consultant, and that's the end of it.

#### DAVID

Trexel, you're not a consultant anymore.

#### TREXEL

No, I--

#### DAVID

You're not consulting on anything. Unless you want to consult some plates about the dirt that's on them.

#### TREXEL

_(dejected realisation)_ So I'm just old-- just-- just regular Trexel Geistman. Not... not a consultant. Not on the executive track. Just Trexel Geistman. Just-- Just Trex-- Just Trex... Just Trexel...

#### DAVID

I mean-- Well, no, hang on, we could... we could maybe... you could become Sink Consultant?

#### TREXEL

_(sings)_ ♪ Who am I? ♫

#### DAVID

Plates Consultant?

#### TREXEL

_(sings)_ ♪ What is my point anymore? ♫

#### DAVID

Kitchen Consultant?

#### TREXEL

_(sings)_ ♪ If I've not got my name written on a door. ♫

#### DAVID

Well, we could write it on the kitchen door.

#### TREXEL

_(sings)_ ♪ If I don't have a job description, then what is the tradition on which I will base my actions and my life? ♫

#### DAVID

_(hopefully)_ Cleaning plates?

#### TREXEL

_(sings)_ ♪ Trexel Geistman-- ♫

#### DAVID

Try using a different name.

#### TREXEL

_(sings)_ ♪ --never cleans a plate. ♫

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

_(sings)_ ♪ Trexel Geistman, standing against Fate. ♫

#### DAVID

Okay, please just stop shouting your own name li--

#### TREXEL

_(sings)_ ♪ If Trexel Geistman isn't a consultant, then what... is... he? ♫ __[trails off into sobbing]__

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ I *had* hoped for fewer songs this time.

#### DAVID

That's a question you have to ask yourself, Trexel.

#### TREXEL

_(bawling)_ Can I have a cupcake?

#### DAVID

Yes. There you go. __[messy sounds of consumption whilst Trexel is crying]__ Oh Trexel, why do you eat like that?

#### TREXEL

_(slightly more composed)_ You know, just because the cupcakes are formed out of slightly chilled slurry, because that's the only... food source we have, it doesn't make it any less charming. __[starts sobbing again]__

#### DAVID

I know. __[continued sounds of 'cupcake' consumption]__ Do you feel better?

#### TREXEL

A little bit.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

I'm gonna go back in the vents now, David. I-- You've given me a lot to think about. __[starts shifting furniture, some cutlery falls to the ground]__

#### DAVID

Fine. If-- if-- if-- if that's... If that's where you need to be right now, then be right there. But let me tell you, there will always be a dirty plate with your name on it. If you want to come back and plonge.

#### TREXEL

_(mumbling in response)_ Alright, well... guess I'll... see you later.

##### [vent hisses shut]

#### DAVID

See you later, Trexel.

##### [fade to new scene, mechanical sounds and that of machinery whirring and hissing]

##### [computer static and beeping]

#### TREXEL

_(recorded playback)_ See you later.

#### DAVID

_(recorded playback)_ See you later, Trexel.

#### HARTRO

_(snarling)_ There you are, you pair of life-ruining stupid... stupid heads.

##### [communications activation bleep]

_(conspiratorially)_ Big Bad Wolf. This is Mother Hubbard. The cupboard is no longer bare. I repeat. The cupboard is no longer bare. It is... unbare. _(normal)_ I've-- What I'm saying is I've-- I've found them. I've found them. Proceeding to extraction.

##### [two more bleeps and communications cease]

##### [show theme starts]
