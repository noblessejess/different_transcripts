Hi everyone, Tim here. This is part one of the bloopers for season 3 of Stellar Firma. Everyone makes mistakes, so why not laugh cruelly at ours? Enjoy.

#### TIM

Three, two, one.

##### [beep]

#### TIM

Ooh, I'm a spooky tape! Five seasons, I'm a spooky tape! __[he and Ben both begin laughing]__ Sorry, sorry, okay.

#### BEN

Putting old Jonny Bigstreams on blast, here.

#### TIM

I'm gonna yell "I'm a spooky tape, aren't I great?"

------

##### [beep]

#### BEN

So you're saying, 'Come to the Department of Planetary Public Permits and Bribery--'

#### TIM

Hard to say, isn't it?

#### BEN

I know! And Randy... __[he and Tim both begin laughing]__

#### TIM

Sorry.

#### BEN

That was a li-- I think, yeah, that was a little bit too, um, too behind the curtain.

------

##### [beep]

#### BEN

But no, I've been here-- We've been here for the last week and a half, and we've got no attention, we haven't had Standards, I haven't seen hide nor hair nor of Truh-- Oh my god. 'Hide nor hair nor Trartro.' Here we go!

#### BEN

Ya goddamn word lord!

#### TIM

Ya word lord! Ya word lord!

#### HELEN

I like that! That's my new job title.

#### BEN

What, 'word lord'?

#### TIM/HELEN

'Word lord.'

#### TIM

Do not defy the word lord! Kill them.

------

##### [beep]

#### TIM

Sacrifice a small being to your ultrimate g-- 'Ultrimate'? Yes. You know what? It was a mistake, but I'm saying ultrimate because it's a great word.

#### BEN

Ultrimate, yes.

##### [beep]

#### TIM

So, y'know, you've got, you got a table, and, and, you know, usually you use it for dinner tables, or-- **[bleep]** me, sorry.

##### [beep]

#### TIM

And there-- Well, let me, let me tell you their motto. It's great. It's on all of their business cards, but it's black card, and it's got bra-- Black print, so, it's, it's a bit hard to say--

#### BEN

Yeah, you're gonna, you're gonna wanna say 'black' again. But not--

#### TIM

What?

#### BEN

You said 'bra-black.'

#### TIM

You **[bleep]** yourself, yeah.

------

##### [beep]

#### TIM

Oh, no, no, no, no. Phonesworth called me afterwards and said, "Give that back you **[bleep]**!" Uh, sorry. Sorry, sorry, okay. Three, two, one.

------

##### [beep]

#### BEN

Okay, um. Don't know how to come back from that pun, quite honestly.

#### TIM

What's wrong with 'spy-lateral damage'?

#### BEN

No, it was very good, but I was like, uh, okay. Do I comment about it, do I...? Cool, alright.

------

##### [beep]

#### BEN

No gunwalls here, in David's Place. The place with no gunwalls. But look--

#### TIM

Have we established why that is? 'Cause it's just, it's just a place.

#### BEN

I don't know. Do we care?

#### TIM

Yeah, no, 'cause we can-- No, I think we can have gun walls-- No, IMOGEN just doesn't believe me. She's like, 'He's not.'

#### BEN

Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

#### TIM

'He's not, you idiot.'

#### BEN

Fine, fine, fine, fine.

------

##### [beep]

#### TIM

Yes, a... punion? Yes? Is that a--

#### BEN

A one-ion.

#### TIM

A one-ion. No, that's too much like onion.

#### BEN

Well, I mean, Tim. That's the joke.

#### TIM

Oh, I see. Okay, okay, okay, in which case, are you-- Do you just say 'Union of one, a one-ion,' and then I'm gonna say, 'It's delicious in pasta'?

------

##### [beep]

#### TIM

Then why did you say it, David? I heard it with my little el-- el ears? [__BEN:__ Because if I was--] Elve ears? Elevears? Okay, right.

#### TIM

Remember, Ben: whenever you're confused, so is David, and you're just like, 'I d-- Okay.'

#### BEN

Yeah, alright, sure.

------

##### [beep]

#### TIM

Editor's note: um, that is, uh, Enola, stretching out David's arms to be real wide. Just so I don't forget when I'm doing the edit on this.

#### BEN

I just enjoy that implies, which is terrifying, that Enola is stronger than David.

#### TIM

Ooh. What, what fun lore. Okay. Cool. Right.

------

##### [beep]

#### TIM

You know-- [__BEN:__ So if you could just-- Could you just--] In a better w--

I also realised: didn't put a timer on!

#### BEN

Oh, bloody 'ell.

#### JENNY

Let me disrobe. Where's the disrobing machine?

#### TIM

Down to the regular--

#### JENNY

Huh?

#### TIM

Oh, so-- **[bleep]** I should shut up. I was just gonna say, 'Down to--' 'Cause you're like, 'I'm gonna disrobe,' and I just wanted to indicate, you know, to regular clothes, not to nude.

#### JENNY

I was gonna try to do one of the cool handy things, where something comes out?

#### TIM

Oooh, yes, do that.

#### JENNY

And take off my robe and hat.

#### TIM

Yeah yeah yeah yeah, oh yeah, right.

#### TIM

Stop. I hiccuped. I hiccuped. Three, two, one.

#### TIM

And maybe they'll have come to some sort of fun agreement around wages and worksafe safety. Worksafe safety? It's workplace safety. Try that again.

##### [beep]

#### TIM

All alliterative businesses succeed. Such as 'Big Bertie's Bouncy Bum!' Number one bum specialists.

##### [Helen absolutely loses it laughing]

#### TIM

No?

##### [Helen continues to lose it]

#### BEN

That's alright. It's okay. No, that's a perfectly useable take, because we have no cross.

#### TIM

So Maddy: um, cut out that bit where Helen is shrieking, and then that should be---

##### [Helen wheezes]

------

##### [beep]

#### TIM

Ohhh, pour a pint for me, pour a pint for me, pour a pint, pour a pint, pour a pint or three, door!

But I feel like a lot of my career has been slightly sabotaged--

#### BEN

Wait, no, hang on a minute Trexel. Standards has definitely directly threatened you.

#### TIM

Have they?

#### TIM

And then all of a sudden, all of your yow-- Lou-- Blah blah blah.

'Abopt' instead of 'adopt.'

##### [beep]

#### TIM

Can we get like, a wild west cowboy version of you with, 'Helen: Bolt-Gun Tongue--'

##### [Helen starts laughing]

#### TIM

They call 'er 'Bolt-Gun Tongue.' And it's just like, hair in the screen, and then like a gory hole gets blasted out, and it's framing you with a smoking mouth.

------

##### [beep]

#### BEN

I've got a thing, and I'm not gonna say it, 'cause obviously improv.
