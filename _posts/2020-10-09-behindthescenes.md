### Transcribed 10/13/20 via [stellarscripts](https://stellarscripts.tumblr.com/) on tumblr

##### [shorter version of the show theme]

#### TIM

Hello and welcome to-- What-- what's that? What's that rustling over there? It's a curtain. Pull back the curtain. Congratulations, you're behind the scenes. Welcome to the behind the scenes episode. My name is Tim Meredith. I am the creator and just main star of Stellar Firma on the Rusty Quill Network and I am joined by the inimitable and the inevitable Katie Seaton, our producer. Say hello Katie!

#### KATIE

Hello.

#### TIM

And Maddy Searle, our editor. Say hello Maddy!

#### MADDY 

_(posh voice)_ How do you do?

#### TIM

I do well. Now, I'm getting a real fancy air from you, Maddy. Katie, take note. Lot fancier. So... just in case you want, you know, notes.

#### KATIE

You've got to earn your fanciness.

#### TIM 

_(laughter)_ Your fancy notes! I am, for some reason, hosting this. Um... that's the end of the thought process on how that decision was made. And we're going to talk about the topics that don't get as much focus. You know, it's not the stuff that happens out front, it's all the important things behind that mean that there is actually a show. So Katie and Maddy have very kindly given up their time to come here to talk with me about how the show gets made, things that we might not understand about what goes into making a show like Stellar Firma... Probably a lot of griping about my process, me doing things wrong. I've prepared for that mentally but not emotionally, but we'll get onto those topics. So to begin with, I think it would be good to go to each of you in turn and find out a little bit more, from your point of view, what it is you do. Imagine I'm the queen and you're all lined up and I'm shaking your hands, and I'm saying _(queen impersonation)_ "And what do you do?" It's that sort of level. So, uh, Katie, _(queen impersonation)_ "What do you do?"

#### KATIE

I love how everyone's got a queen voice. __[everyone laughs, Tim makes noises in the manner of a queen impersonation]__ *(queen impersonation)* "That sounds very interesting!"

What I do is maybe not very interesting in some ways, in that it's kind of the organising role. I'm the one that coordinates the show and the various things that happen along the way to get it out. And the workflow on this show is fairly... convoluted, is that fair to say?

#### TIM

Unique?

#### KATIE

Yeah.

#### TIM

A shining star amongst the firmament.

#### KATIE

_(sarcastic)_ Yeah. Those-- those are the words. So we have a bunch of stages that we have to go through to get the show that you end up listening to because it's improvised and because some elements are not improvised, so that's--

#### TIM 

_(stage whispering)_ Shh, Katie, Katie--

#### KATIE

_(quietly)_ What?

#### TIM

--they're not allowed to know that. It's all improvised and perfect the first time. It's fine, don't tell them.

#### KATIE 

_(crosstalk, also stage whispering)_ What? Oh, you should have said!

#### TIM

Nah, okay. I'll stop interrupting.

#### KATIE 

__[laughs]__ So Tim and Ben and whoever else is guesting on the show, quite often Jenny and various other people, get together in their studio or, these days, remotely and improvise the main bulk of an episode, which is then handed over to Maddy, who tries to make sense of it in a vocal cut and produce something coherent.

#### TIM

Your implication is noted, and I will hold it against you. Continue.

#### KATIE 

_(under her breath)_ Fine by me. __[Tim giggles]__ This thing goes back to Tim, who reviews that and then writes the bits that Imogen reads. We then set up a recording for Imogen, that all then gets put together with the sound design that we hear at the end by Maddy again, and finally there's a final check by Tim, and then Alex gives it a once-over and then we release it. Not always the same day.

#### TIM

No. __[Katie and Tim laugh]__ If it's gone particularly badly, sometimes the same day! But ideally--

#### KATIE

Occasionally it has been the same day.

#### TIM

--not the same day. Not the same day. I think I'm yet to be the cause of it being a last-day fiasco. I think I'm right in saying I have not, as of yet, messed it up so badly. It's normally some technical issue or the server's deleted everything and run away into a corner or something like that.

#### KATIE

That's normally what goes on, yeah. Or occasionally Anil jumps in and says we need an extra content warning or something. _(jokingly)_ For some reason, I know not why.

#### TIM 

_(crosstalk)_ Yeah. We say a lot of stuff, and some of it needs-- people need warning about!

#### KATIE

Yeah.

#### TIM

And then occasionally after we release it, one of our lovely fans will say, "Hey, guess what! This is still wrong!" and we'll go back and change it. But hey, you know what, that's what three checks are for, __[Katie chuckles]__ for an audience member to notice something we got wrong. Such is life. And, Maddy, wh-wh-- hey-- _(queen impersonation)_ "Phillip, put that down! Maddy, what is it that you do?"

#### MADDY

I do the general audio wizardry, and make, even though it's people in separate rooms across the country, sound like they're on a big massive spaceship. __[Tim laughs]__ So, first of all I get the raw improvising audio and, as Katie said, try to make sense of it. Try to just sort of--

#### KATIE 

_(whispering)_ Vindicated!

#### MADDY

Yeah. __[laughs, Katie joins in]__ And, I try and make sure that there's no annoying little mouth smacks or clicks in it so that all the audio sounds nice and smooth and fluent.

And then it gets sent back to Tim, who looks at it and does the Imogen interstitials, so the little lines that Imogen says, and any sound effects that wants to be put in, and then I go do that and maybe add in a little sound effect magic to the mixture, and--

#### TIM

Aren't you selling yourself short when you say 'a little'? There's a rather large amount of it, and we'll be getting on to that. But, but, __[indecisive noise]__ I'll come back to that.

#### MADDY

Yes, I often have to mess around with mortar and pestles and __[Katie chuckles]__ all sorts of odd things around my house to make it sound like other things, and so it's kind of confusing and fun but, I try and do it when my parents aren't around, __[Tim and Katie laugh]__ so they don't see me messing around with a mortar and pestle, or moving around my jumper to make it sound like someone is walking down some stairs, or whatever.

And then it gets sent off to Alex, who does the final master, and I get some notes back to how I can do it differently next time if there's anything to change, and hopefully that's a beautiful finished episode.

#### TIM

Good! And that was actually something I wanted to dig into 'cause you mentioned there the sort of sound effects and the foley and so you're responsible for the soundscaping and the incidental sound effects, which in an audio production like this is really sort of the fabric of the world. Without it, it all sounds sort of weird and spaceless. I'm aware that you are not the first editor that we had. We went through one! Ah, burned him out, we did! Uh, two, in fact! I just actually forgot we had two other editors all before you--

#### KATIE

Yeah. Congratulations! __[laughs]__

#### TIM

--were all but dust, Maddy, as you know. No, we had Ed and then more recently David, so you joined the show with a preset sound and a preset feel and theme, but I think people will have noticed that, since you joined us for season two, the sound effect load has increased substantially! And I apologise for that. But how have you had-- How was your experience of creating specific sound effects? You mentioned you having to, you know-- messing around with mortar and pestles, and rattling jumpers and such, how have you found the process of getting an idea of what you need from me and then having to create something that fulfills that?

#### MADDY

It's been a really interesting process because there's a lot of things, like the little beep that IMOGEN does before she speaks, that has to be consistent throughout every single episode, the way the doors sound, the way the hum of the engines of the space station sound, all that kind of thing.

But then when it comes to shoving Trexel around in a cage, I have a bit more freedom to be like "Oh, what will this cage sound like?" __[Maddy and Tim laugh]__ And it's quite-- it's really such a fun challenge to be like, oh, these guys just came up in a second of improv this fantastical scenario and I have to somehow try and make it sound like it's actually happening. __[Maddy and Katie chuckle]__ So it's quite interesting. And, for example, I had quite a lot of fun doing David 7's crafting when he was making various things. I would just get the scissors and the tape out, and I would just __[Tim and Katie chuckle]__ make a sort of mess out of paper and tape just-- that looked nothing at all like what David was making, but *sounded* like what David was making. That's the important thing.

#### TIM

Art Attack ASMR, that sort of thing.

#### MADDY

Yep, exactly, so...

#### KATIE

I always think that when you get really vague sound directions like that you can learn a little bit about how the mind of the editor works? Because Tim goes "crafting" and your mind goes towards paper and sellotape and it just kinda says a little bit about the sound designer.

#### TIM

And I think sometimes when it's something-- 'cause as you said there's sort of two types of sound direction that I will give--if you can call what I do direction, which people do and I'm paid for it--but there's the "I need something to sound exactly like this 'cause I have a very specific sort of idea in my mind" and then there's the "I dunno, something like this!" So, I think a good example of that would've been like, "We've gotta toboggan down paper on a clone. Whatever makes sense to you for that!" and then you have to sort of go in and go, "Okay, so what does-- what is this?"

So, do you find it easier to have a very specific direction that you're trying to hit, or to be given a broad brief which means that you're not having to be, I suppose, exacting in what you're aiming for but you've got sort of the world to choose from?

#### MADDY

I think there's kind of pros and cons to both. I think, for example with the tobogganing, I had to kinda go more into sound effects that were already online rather than ones that I could make in my house.

#### TIM

Sure. And we use Freesound, don't we?

#### MADDY

Yeah, we generally use Freesound. And I decided to go for piles of dry leaves for the sound of the paper, because that kind of gave the same effect without me having to shred a million bits of paper and dance around in them in my house.

#### TIM 

_(joking)_ Oh, laziness, is it? Okay, no, I understand. You're not committed to the project. No, no, that's fine, that's fine.

##### [Maddy laughs]

And, coming back to you, Katie, your sort of background. Because again, production is a dark art, and it means different things to different shows. Have you always been-- Well, always been a producer, I'm assuming you were a child at one point, but how much production had you-- like producing roles had you done before you joined Rusty Quill?

#### KATIE

I mean, not so much. My... I came into it via I actually have a background first of all in music and then I moved into sound design myself in the last decade or so and work on other audio productions elsewhere doing that.

But I was making a film for a local charity about a refugee who lives under the government scheme in our area, and because I wanted to make that film, which was an animation, I had to basically produce it or it wouldn't have been made, and that's how I got into the production side of things. And along the way of doing that, I realised there's an awful lot more to the business and organisational and conceptual project management side than you would think when you go "Oh, I know, I'll make a lovely animation telling a story, [__TIM: [laughs]__ It will be delightful!] and then I can make some great noises and write some cool music!"

And, when you have to be the one that actually makes that happen, it makes you realise that sort of the business and organisational side and the creative side are kinda one and the same thing more or less, and you can't have one without the other. [__TIM:__ Yeah.] And that was my way in, really. I hadn't done a vast amount more, really, from the producers side until I joined Rusty Quill and started working on this project.

#### TIM

And how did you come across Rusty Quill? Did Alex put a call out? Or did he accost you on the street? __[Katie chuckles]__ How did you come to be with us?

#### KATIE

Yeah, there were--

#### TIM

I must say, it's ridiculous: _(laughing)_ I don't know the answer to this, Katie! I've just realised. I have no idea. One day somebody said, "Katie's your producer" and I said "Okay!"

#### KATIE 

_(laughing)_ "Alright then!"

#### TIM

So where did that come to-- "Well, I suppose that seems fine. I won't ask any follow up questions!"

#### KATIE

Yeah, there was a job advert that went out on all the various audio networks and things which I follow. And I had a little look around. I was aware of the shows that Rusty Quill put out. I wasn't particularly aware of Rusty Quill Gaming but I'd heard of the others. And so I thought __[intrigued noise]__ "Yeah, I've heard that they're good, you know." And I'd heard a couple of episodes of *Magnus*, I think. So I checked it out and thought, 'huh, they look like... a cool company doing interesting things'.

#### TIM

A cool-- A cool bunch of people doing cool people things.

#### KATIE

Yeah!

##### [Tim and Katie chuckle]

#### TIM

And I've been instructed here to ask you about pandas and naggy tweets. I do not know the context for that phrase.Katie, what about pandas?

#### KATIE

Okay, so apparently I have full power over panda-veto here.

#### TIM

Sorry, sorry. __[stammers a little]__ We're saying this as if it's a thing that we understand. Pan-Panda veto?

#### KATIE

Yeah! I have it from Alex that if you want two hundred and fifty pandas, I'm allowed to say no.

#### TIM

Oh, I understand.

#### KATIE

He was very specific about the pandas.

#### TIM

The pandas are a metaphor, aren't they?

##### [Tim and Katie laugh]

#### KATIE

Possibly. I have no idea what for.

#### TIM

I be-- Now, now. I'm going to take a guess. Is this where your job is for me, sometimes, for where I get overexcited and say things like, "Oh hey, let's set all of the episodes in season two inside a big pile of paper"--

#### KATIE

Yes.

#### TIM

--which is incredibly difficult to soundscape--

#### KATIE

Yes!

#### TIM

--you can say, "No, Tim. You get a couple, and then we have to leave the realm of paper because Maddy needs to sleep."

##### [everyone chuckles]

#### KATIE

Or "have you considered a paperless office?"

#### TIM

Could be. Maybe it's all digital now. And then you just have to go "bleep bloop!" and then it's done.

#### KATIE

Yeah, so that's the pandas. And that-- apparently it's part of my job. Have I ever said no to you about anything, actually?

#### TIM

No. You know what I am--

#### KATIE

I'm rubbish at that!

#### TIM

I'd like to set the record straight! I am eminently reasonable to work with. __[Katie bursts out laughing]__ Do you both agree? _(yelling)_ Do you both agree that I'm eminently reasonable to work with?!

#### KATIE

Tim.

#### TIM 

_(softly)_ Yes.

#### KATIE

Calm down.

#### TIM

Okay. _(calmer)_ Am I eminently-- Hey, hey. Oh hang on, I'm calm now. __[mouth noise]__ Hey-- oh. _(slurring)_ Not that it matters. Am I reasonable to work with? Don't worry, but--? __[hopeful questioning noise]__

#### KATIE

Maddy?

#### MADDY

I would lean to the affirmative in this case.

#### KATIE

Yeahhhhh.

#### TIM 

_(laughing)_ Don't damn me with faint praise! __[Maddy and Katie laugh]__ *(mockingly)* "I would lean to the affirmative." Hot dang.

#### KATIE

Nice and-- It is an important point to note that Tim is not Trexel, he's actually a good bloke.

#### TIM

Hey, don't let anybody know. It'll ruin my street cred.

#### KATIE

Ah, I know, yeah.

#### TIM

People know from the streams, I'm actually quite sensitive. __[Katie chuckles]__ Umm, naggy tweets. Naggy tweets?

#### KATIE

Naggy tweets, yes. Well there was one time when you were due to review an episode and I told you about it.

#### TIM 

__[excited soft gasp]__ Yes! I remember this.

#### KATIE

Then you were overdue to review the episode.

#### TIM

The only time.

#### KATIE

And I told you about it again.

#### TIM

The only time this has ever happened.

#### KATIE

This happened a second time.

#### TIM

Apart from that time, the only time.

#### KATIE

And you said "Sorry about that. I'll do it over the weekend. Straight away."

#### TIM

Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

#### KATIE

I check into the office Saturday afternoon. No episode review.

#### TIM

Not done.

#### KATIE

I go onto Twitter, you're singing a song.

##### [Tim and Katie laugh]

#### TIM 

_(mock-surprise)_ I got distracted by a song?!

#### KATIE

And you're asking all your fans for suggestions for more songs that you could sing.

#### TIM

Yes.

#### KATIE

So I type "The Ballad of the Episode Review?", question mark.

#### TIM 

__[affirmative noises]__ But was it done by the end of the weekend? That's the main question.

#### KATIE

_(softly)_ I don't think it was, actually.

#### TIM

No! __[all three laugh]__ I thought that it was! Katie, don't block my spot here. Say it was done by the end of the weekend!

#### KATIE

I mean, the thing is it was that Eurovision thing. To be fair, you probably did a lot more good for just entertaining people by doing that then you did by reviewing the episode, so I didn't want to push it too hard. But, yeah....

#### TIM

Yeah, well...

#### KATIE

So that's sort of my nuclear option. If nagging by the usual channel doesn't work, I can publicly shame him on Twitter.

#### TIM [laughing]

Move into internet shaming. __[Katie laughs]__ I don't think that's a thing we should be encouraging! Shame people on the internet into doing their jobs. Oh dear.

Okay well, let's rapidly move away from my past professional failures back towards Maddy. Maddy's nice! _(pouting)_ Maddy hasn't tweeted me saying on the internet that I'm not doing my job. _(normal)_

So, we've already talked about sound effects, but a lot of what you're doing as well is the vocal editing. Now, as everyone knows, it is an improvised podcast and, therefore, everything is perfect the first time. But on the rare occasion that somebody, let's say, sneezes or perhaps a car explodes outside, some editing does need to happen. So what's the process like of taking the raw audio, which is sometimes in excess of fifty minutes long, and turning that into something close to, oh, I don't know, twenty or so minutes?

#### MADDY

Well, first of all, run it through various processing. Just try and make all the audio levels relatively similar because sometimes people are _(louder)_ very shouty and _(whispers)_ sometimes people are very quiet.

#### TIM 

_(shouting)_ Who are you referring to Maddy? I can't imagine.

##### [Maddy chuckles]

#### MADDY

It's very-- There are multiple culprits of this but it's completely, totally part of the dramatic structure of the episode so I do not mind it one bit. But yes, you have to kind of make sure that when people are being quiet you can still hear them and when people are being loud that they're not burning people's ears off. So just getting that balance.

#### TIM

Would this be what the cool kids refer to as 'compression'? Is that it? Is this-- is this 'compression'?

#### MADDY

It is.

#### TIM 

__[excited noises]__ I learnt a thing!

##### [Katie and Maddy chuckle]

#### MADDY

And there's also some noise reduction, so if there's kind of a buzzy fridge in the background, you can just get rid of that so it's just nice, clean audio. And then I just comb through trying to find the bits where people are deciding what to talk about next or have fumbled over something. Just snip it out, get it out, and then once there's-- the main structure of the episode is there, I can go through and comb for all the tiny little clicks and flubs and crackles on the audio that just make it slightly unpleasant to listen to but are easily removed. And by that point it is pretty much all sorted.

#### TIM

So I'm going to ask a question. And I'm going to give you carte blanche to answer very, very honestly. At a certain point, do you wish to never hear Trexel and David speak ever again? Because I think, of all the people in the world--other than Ben and myself because the noises are coming out of our faces--[you] have had to listen to more of those two than any other living human being alive.

##### [Katie chuckles]

#### MADDY

Hm. I think if there's a particularly tricky point in the edit where I have to listen to the same phrase multiple times, there's a bit where I get, "ahhhh!", __[Tim chuckles]__ I could just recite this section verbatim, and I think it's only at that point.

#### KATIE

Do you find you lose the ability to hear it like with-- [__MADDY:__ Yeah.] neutrally, as in the end. It's just a bunch of sounds at some point.

##### [Tim chuckles]

#### MADDY

It's just a bunch of meaningless sounds that have *no* context.

#### KATIE

Yeah.

#### MADDY

And I'm just like, is this even good anymore? I don't know. Does it sound like a robot or does it sound like a human? I have no idea. Please, please help.

#### TIM

"Please. Please Trexel, stop yelling the word 'moisturiser' until it has no meaning at all."

#### KATIE

I'd imagine that it's quite fun though, isn't it? I imagine it's quite funny to be to able to--

#### TIM

Your Honour, Your Honour, leading question. Leading question to the witness.

##### [Maddy chuckles]

#### KATIE

Oh, sorry.

#### TIM

"Isn't it quite fun? Wouldn't you say it was fun-- Would it be quite fun? Maddy, fun, correct?" Yeah, sorry, again, I keep saying I'll stop interrupting but I will *not.* I will keep interrupting.

#### KATIE

_(crosstalk)_ No, it's okay.I mean to be fair, you are supposed to be our host, right? So...

#### TIM

Emphasis on the 'supposed to be'. But yes, Katie-- Maddy-- Anybody! Maddy, is it fun?

#### MADDY

It is fun. And especially when there's a certain point where you or Ben have come to a point where you're just like, "Sorry Maddy" __[Tim laughs]__ and you just know [__KATIE: [chuckles]__ Yeah.] that I'm going to be with my head in my hands going "Oh no. What have you done." [__TIM:__ There have been--] And I'm like-- I very much appreciate the little shoutouts I get. And I feel like this is my contribution to the art form. Just these little moments where I get a little shoutout.

#### TIM

I'm glad. I do sometimes say those-- I do, you know, when me and Ben are recording and realise that something is an absolute nightmare to work out what happens where. 'Cause sometimes we record a section and realise, "Ah, there was some plot that was supposed to go in the middle there." But obviously we can't remember any edit points because we yelled that stuff forty-five minutes ago. So we just have to be like, "Maddy, we're going to record what's supposed to be in there, and hopefully there's an edit point. Sorry!" So, yes. I'm glad that you get some comfort from our __[snickers]__ apologies. So Katie.

#### KATIE

Yes.

#### TIM

You mentioned that this was only your second proper production job and I imagine quite a different thing to be a producer of an improvised podcast recorded in sometimes three different locations as to being the producer on an animation you had full creative control over. So, the process of learning to be Producer: a smooth one? A bumpy one? How did it go for you? And how is it still going? Because everyday is a school day.

#### KATIE

The trickiest bit was that I was coming in on a workflow that had already been established and happened to be around Christmas time as well.

#### TIM

Ideal. The ideal time to join.

#### KATIE

So there was quite a lot of absent-- __[chuckles]__ Yeah.

#### TIM

Everyone's off. You're trying to be off as well. Everything's confusing. Welcome to the show!

#### KATIE

I remember one of the first things I dealt with. We had about two days to get Imogen's lines down otherwise there was going to be a real production problem, and she called in sick that day we were supposed to be doing it. And so that was a real introduction to how it can be when every one stage of the process depends on the previous stage.

So yeah, it was about learning how you do things in Rusty Quill which, as you say, is quite different from-- I mean, __[sighs]__ producing my own things has its own different sets of problems. You know, also dealing with interpreters and there were sort of-- it was a lot more dealing with managing people and getting them in the right place and in the right mood and that sort of thing. Whereas it's all a little bit more kind of spoon fed here. But on the other hand, I guess there's less agency in a way for the same reason. And so you're working within certain constraints and doing your best to get things to happen. I mean, but luckily everybody who's on the project wants to be here and is pretty obliging.

So, those teething problems where I was just trying to get my head around how it all works weren't too bad because people were on my side and there was, you know, as I said, there were these moments of I didn't realise I was supposed to do something and someone would say, "So Katie, are you going to tell me to do this?" __[Tim and Katie laugh]__ in a--

#### TIM

"Katie, I feel like I should've recorded some episodes. Is that-- [__KATIE:__ Yeah.] Do we do it now? Now, please? Now? Okay, now. Okay, cool. Yeah, now, now, now."

#### KATIE

Yeah, yeah. So it was a lot of me sort of like-- all my job was to say, "Yeah, yeah. What you just said, do that. Yeah, that's it. Yeah."

##### [Tim and Katie laugh]

#### TIM

A shockingly important job. And this is going to be some perspective from my side, is that, at the end of the day, the podcast, at least the raw audio of it, is very, very much under our control. I live very close to Ben, we live very near each other. We could do it anytime! You know, we could just sit down and do an episode. And that fact, for some reason, makes it very difficult to sit down and do an episode. __[Katie chuckles]__ The fact that one could do it at any time [__KATIE:__ Yeah.] means often it doesn't happen when it should. And so just having an external producer, somebody who has that wider picture of 'well, if this doesn't happen, then this doesn't happen, then this doesn't happen and then Alex is shouting at us all' [__KATIE:__ Yes. Yeah.] really does help to be like, "I know you've got a deadline over here, but there's thirty things between here and now. So maybe Tim, maybe, we'll get this recorded. Correct?" And I go, "Yes, that seems eminently reasonable", and go and do it. But yes. It's-- Yeah.

#### KATIE

The one snag here is that you're clever.

#### TIM 

_(pleased, weird accent)_ Well, flatterer!

#### KATIE

And you can figure it out. __[chuckles]__

#### TIM

Umm, you'd think so.

#### KATIE

If I say-- I would say, "You've got to do this now", and you say-- you can say, "But surely if I did it next weekend, it would still be fine?" I'll be like, _(through gritted teeth)_ "Well yes, technically!"

##### [Tim and Katie laugh]

#### TIM

_(through gritted teeth)_ "It would, but then if something else goes wrong, then we're screwed Tim!"

#### KATIE

_(gritted teeth)_ "No, don't ask! Just humour me, okay?"

##### [Tim and Katie laugh]

#### TIM

It's like when a dog learns to open the fridge. You're like, "I mean, sure. It's kinda cool that you've learnt to open the fridge. But you're not supposed to eat the things in the fridge." And that's-- I'm the dog in that metaphor. __[laughs]__

#### KATIE

You're the dog. Okay, you're kind of-- I kind of lost...

#### TIM

_(crosstalk, laughing)_ I'm a dog opening a fridge is what I'm saying. Is that clear?

#### KATIE

Okay.

#### TIM

I'm a dog opening a fridge.

#### KATIE

Adorable!

#### TIM

And you've had to push up a chair against it. And that chair is the workflow. Does that make sense? __[chuckles]__

#### KATIE

It's for your own good. Yeah, it does make sense.

#### TIM

Maddy, another thing that you've had to do--and this is new to season two as well, and specifically to when we got into Sales, which I believe was sort of relatively-- 'cause you didn't join right at the start of season two, you joined relatively early on--is that we started introducing the clients appearing at the end and just passing over the idea of like "Well, we've talked about our client in the episode based on audience suggestion and they get about five seconds of a speaking role at the end. And neither Ben or I are doing it. So what's it gonna be?" So how have you found having to-- Well, I suppose you have a voice credit in some of these episodes now.

#### MADDY

That was a lot of fun. I think David Devereux did a few of them and he kind of introduced the concept to me when he was handing over the role. And I was like, "Ooh, ooh. __[Tim chuckles]__ A little nugget at the end of just pure nonsense that I get to participate in." __[Katie chuckles]__ So, can only really remember two that I properly did a voice for--I think other ones were probably more just sound-effects based--but the-- so one was Stefan the Mantis Shrimp where I just made a __[burbling]__ noise--

##### [Tim and Katie chuckle]

#### TIM

I remember!

#### KATIE

I loved that. It was so cool.

#### MADDY

--and then pitched it down. It was just a low-pitched __[burbling]__ noise, so it wasn't particularly high-tech. And then the other one was Ethel Unction Yeems, who was very heavily based on my step-dad's mother, sort of my step-grandmother. It was an incredible--

#### KATIE 

_(laughing)_ Oh, it's all coming out now.

#### MADDY

Yeah. My-- who has an incredible Cambuslang Glasgow accent. And so Ethel Unction Yeems was, _(stuffy posh voice)_ "Oh! Oh dear! Oh no! Oh dear!" __[Tim and Katie laugh]__ which is a bit more English, but it just kind of--

#### TIM

_(stuffy posh voice)_ "I've dropped my handbag and soup tin!" _(normal voice)_ That sort of thing.

##### [Katie laughs]

#### MADDY

Yeah. That. That. Exactly the sort of classic Lady Bracknell/Edith Evans style. __[Tim chuckles softly]__ So... Even though it was only two seconds long, I feel like it was some of my finest work.

##### [Tim and Katie laugh]

#### TIM

With a cameo like that, you can really steal the-- 'cause you get the last word in the episode as well. You're like, right, you know, it's only two seconds but that's all anyone's gonna remember is that-- just Ethel Unction Yeems warbling excitedly to herself. __[Maddy chuckles]__ And I'm gonna have to-- And I know dearest departed David Devereux--he's not dead, he's just not on the show anymore, which is the same sort of thing--but he did the-- What were they? Livestock.

#### KATIE

The sheep.

#### TIM

Were they all sheep? Was it sheep that were saying "Why, David? Why?"

#### KATIE

Yeah!

#### MADDY

Yeah.

#### KATIE

'Cause I heard his POD UK talk. __[Tim laughs]__ Yeah, yeah. Just hilarious.

#### TIM

And again, I know obviously, yes, I'm not pulling focus but I do remember that one as again another example of like, 'well, we've worked very hard on this episode but the best thing in it is a man going _(imitating sheep voice)_ "Why, David? Why?!" as a sheep'.

#### MADDY

And there's very similar stuff in his new show *The Dungeon Economic Model* where there's all sorts of little interjections that he does, and I think it's basically all the frustrated __[Tim laughs]__ Stellar Firma energy coming out __[Katie joins laughing]__ in little bursts, [__KATIE:__ Has to go somewhere!] so it's brilliant. So, if you haven't checked it out, please do 'cause it's brilliant.

#### TIM

And a shout-out. And a shout-out that we know is gonna remain in because Maddy edits the episode and Maddy did the shout-out so it's staying in, David. You're welcome. __[everyone chuckles]__ And, you know what, connected to that as well, connected to the topic of us carefully crafting a show and then the best thing from it being something unintentional: the outtakes, which obviously you have put together for this season, and a bumper crop this season as well. Two! Two outtake episodes. I don't even know-- Will the second one be out by the time this goes out? Who's got the schedule? I don't even know. This doesn't matter.

#### KATIE

__[gasps]__ I can't remember!

#### TIM

It doesn't matter. If it has, [__KATIE:__ Maybe.] you know, and if it hasn't, you've got that to look forward to. But we got two sets of outtakes coming out. How do you-- 'cause there's *a lot* of audio to go through, and much of it is *not* for human consumption, so how do you siphon off those outtakes and then put that together into something that people would actually want to listen to without throwing up?

#### MADDY

__[chuckles]__ So, when I'm doing the vocal cuts and also when David was doing vocal cuts and also Elizabeth has also done some, we always siphon off the little outtakes into a separate track on the audio editing processor and just make sure that it's corralled in a little corner so that we know where it is and we can come back to it later. And when it came to the end of the season, I dug out all these little, little nuggets from throughout the season and sifted through them all and--

#### TIM

Would these be dank nugs? __[Katie laughs]__ Would these be those dank nugs I've heard the kids talking about?

#### MADDY

Yes. Yes, it--

#### TIM

Excellent. Excellent.

#### MADDY

They aren't chimkin nuggers [*sic*] but they are dank nuggers.

##### [Tim and Katie laugh]

#### TIM

Oh, you hear that noise? That was the noise of that whistling over my head _(laughing)_ as it went beyond my sphere of--

#### MADDY

Hello fellow kids. I am cool!

##### [Katie and Tim laugh]

#### TIM

Which, and as you know, saying "Hey kids, I'm cool", it's how they know. If you don't say it, [__KATIE:__ *(laughing)* It's true.] they don't know. They're on their--

#### MADDY

Yeah, they just-- [__KATIE:__ Yeah.] You have to confirm. You have to confirm for the kids.

#### KATIE

_(crosstalk)_ You have to give a lot of clarity for them to get about your coolness.

#### TIM

_(crosstalk)_ They're over there on the-- They're over there on their TikTok downloading their details to the Chinese government. They're just cool kids!

##### [Katie laughs]

#### MADDY

Yep.

#### TIM

They're having fun. __[bursts into laughter, Katie joins laughing]__ Sorry, I totally derailed that. __[laughs]__

So moving on to a more serious topic, so obviously we'd all love to make our living out of working for the delightful corporate borg that is Rusty Quill but, as we know, audio fiction and podcasting in general, it's very difficult to make any kind of meaningful living from, and so I believe we all have side gigs and other jobs. I know I do! Mine's deeply tedious so we're not gonna talk about it. But let's start with you Katie. What else do you do, and how do you balance what is quite a time consuming production job with other things?

#### KATIE

I work as a composer and sound designer for some projects, freelance.

#### TIM

Fancy.

#### KATIE

I also still teach a little bit of music, and I also have two children, so I am busy.

#### TIM

So you got three jobs is what's happened there. You've got three full time jobs.

#### KATIE

Four...

#### TIM

Four full time jobs. __[chuckles]__

#### KATIE

I'm including the kids.

#### TIM

Now, are we counting each child as a full-- Oh no, it would be that so maybe five.

#### KATIE

Five. Five jobs.

#### TIM

Now, here's an important question: having a child is a full time job. Is having a second child two full time jobs, or does it compound because there's any efficiency?

#### KATIE

Well, it can be one-and-a-half or it can be two-and-a-half, depending on how much they're trying to kill each other at any point.

#### TIM

Sure. Sure. So yeah, so how do you find yourself balancing those things?

#### KATIE

Well, you'll notice you get messages from me at gone midnight, so that's one way. It sort of got a bit different since the COVID thing happened because now myself and my other half are both working from home and so we just sort of do a little do-si-do around each other and sort of make it work on a daily basis at this point. [__TIM:__ Hmm.] It helps if you really like everything you do. That really helps because your brain is focused on it more than if it was like _(drained)_ "Oh, gotta go down the office and do another eight hours of data entry, great," [__TIM:__ Yeah.] you know. So there's that. And there is some intersection between everything I do, although, producing Stellar Firma and teaching teenagers piano and singing are quite a long way apart actually, but they're on this spectrum where they can inform each other and that can be quite nice actually if I-- I work with boys quite a lot--

#### TIM

My commiserations.

#### KATIE

__[chuckles]__ I love working with boys actually. I like-- particularly singing because--we are getting way off topic here, but--their voice is changing.

#### TIM

_(deep voice)_ Because of our baritone voices!

#### KATIE

__[chuckles]__ Yeah!

#### TIM

Ahh!

#### KATIE

I do. I like-- I love-- I go away for the summer holidays and I come back and they've grown a foot and they've gone down __[Tim laughs]__ an octave and half, you know. __[everyone laughs]__ They don't know what to do with themselves!

#### TIM

They've got great range but it's so over time that you'd have to record the high parts *earlier* in their career and then just work your way down until you've got a full scale.

#### KATIE

Should have thought of that. Yeah. But, because I obviously work with sound technology a bit, they are often quite interested in that sort of thing and we can start combining performance and sound and... music theory and bring it all together holistically, which is really nice. So, yes, it's a big existence really and, although they're all separate roles, they do sort of interlink a lil' bit so there is that too.

#### TIM

Very good. Very good. And Maddy?

#### MADDY

At the moment Rusty Quill is the only thing I got going on, so that is...

#### TIM

__[gasps]__ Full timer.

#### MADDY

Yeah. Well, I still work with Rusty Quill part time, so the rest of the time I am a woman of leisure, which is not ideal, __[everyone laughs]__ because I am--

#### KATIE

You got your own show though, haven't you?

#### MADDY

Yes, I do. So, previous to joining Rusty Quill, I had *The Prickwillow Papers*, which is my comedy-fantasy audio drama, and annoyingly with COVID I thought, "Oh, there'll be loads of time to work on my own creative projects", but no, my brain is mush, so that's __[Tim laughs, Katie hums in agreement]__ not really helping, but hopefully at some point I write new things? Question mark? And also, I'm gonna be dipping my toe into the world of speech and language therapy because I have applied for an MSc. [__KATIE:__ Alright!] So I'm gonna-- And find out in a couple weeks whether I've actually got in so...

#### KATIE

Oh, fantastic! Good luck!

#### TIM

Ooh! And Katie, you brought up something that I want to talk about there. Obviously, during all of season 2, we started recording in the same room and doing stuff together, and then midway through something happened. Let's not go into it now, but we're now recording in separate locations. So actually, this is a question for you Katie and for Maddy because this impacts both things. How has the show been different to produce and edit since it's gone from people in the same studio, in the same sound environments, on central booking schedules to the two main characters being in different locations and having to make that work and actually, at the same time, we were introducing more extra characters so we had to do three-way remote recordings and things like that, how has that changed things? I think I'll start with you Katie, but Maddy you will almost certainly __[Katie chuckles]__ have something to say on this topic, I imagine, as well.

#### KATIE

Yeah. I mean, I have been the lucky one in all of this process. I think probably for Maddy it's harder because we can no longer just follow a standard procedure for reducing the noise or whatever because it has to be more case-by-case and you have to do more splicing together. But for me, it has been a boon really, 'cause-- It's about Imogen really, because what was happening is you and Ben like to record in batches of five, because of the way the show is structured in twenty-five episode seasons, you like to get together one weekend, do your thing, and have those batches for convenience. Unfortunately, that means Imogen also has to record in batches of five once the vocal cuts are done, and that means we look at every five weeks, but the London studio is open every two weeks. And so, every other batch of five we're looking at either having her record the interstitials, as we call them, before we've done the cuts and written the scripts or a week late and potentially throwing the schedule out. And that's without all the things like people calling in sick or whatever.

#### TIM

Let's call it what it is: selfishness. Selfish people being selfish people.

#### KATIE

Yeah. Yeah.

#### TIM

We understand.

#### KATIE

That's right, Tim. So...

##### [Tim and Katie laugh]

#### TIM

You can't agree with me! When you agree with me, Katie, it worries me.

##### [everyone laughs]

#### KATIE

But it makes you laugh, and I enjoy that!

##### [Katie and Tim chuckle]

Yeah, so that was one of the more challenging bits about setting schedules, and also, when we're casting and booking in guest performers, making that work with getting them to the studio as well at the times when it is available and there aren't other shows being recorded can be challenging.

Now that we're recording remotely and Imogen is doing it over Skype with you, Tim, that solves two problems. One is what I just mentioned about bookings, and the other is the fact that Alex is possibly the busiest man I've ever met __[Tim chuckles]__ and it takes one thing off of him, and so it's a lot easier to get done, isn't it? Really, we could just slip it in one evening.

#### TIM

It's meant that I've actually started being a proper director [__KATIE:__ Mm.] in certain cases, because I have a script and a performer and it's-- My opinion about how things are going is important for some reason.

#### KATIE

Aww!

#### TIM

That's been a lovely new _(chuckling)_ experience for me [__KATIE:__ That's nice.] which I find deeply, deeply uncomfortable __[Katie chuckles]__ when someone's like "Was that good?" and I'm like "I don't know why you're asking me-- Oh, 'cause I wrote it."

#### KATIE

Yeah. __[laughs]__

#### TIM

_(flustered)_ And then I-- It's my show-- Uh, yeah, I'm-- "No. It's not good but I can't tell you how." You know, that sort of fun stuff.

#### KATIE

I think, I mean, that's what we call 'imposter syndrome', is it?

#### TIM

Yes! That's it.

#### KATIE

Yes. Yeah.

#### TIM

That's it. And I have broken into the Louvre and all the lights have come on and there's bells ringing.

#### KATIE

Yeah... Yeah, so it's helped me but probably Maddy has a different take on the thing.

##### [Katie and Maddy laugh]

#### TIM

And I just want, just between those two, I want to make sure we do a big shout-out because I think a huge part of why that's managed to go smoothly is because, obviously the whole team at Rusty Quill, but Alex and Hannah sort of centrally and I believe Martyn on the tech. I'm sure I'm leaving people out and the Herculean effort was April--

#### KATIE

_(crosstalk)_ I think April Sumner probably wants her call-out there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

#### TIM

Oh yes, of course April. *Big*, big-- Lot of work from April. The sheer amount of work that went into like, "Right, this has happened. Let's get everybody involved in every show a remote recording set-up in about two weeks flat." That's no trivial thing [__KATIE:__ No.] and they did an incredible job. Just want to make sure that's gets in there [__KATIE:__ Yeah.] because I'm gonna ask Alex for a pay rise.

##### [Katie laughs]

Maddy though, your perspective on, you know, how things have changed since we've gone to sort of full remote production?

#### MADDY

I think the first thing that I would say has changed is that originally, of course, you and Ben would be recording in the same room, which is good because you know when each other is speaking and there's no lag so that's a good thing, but also there can sometimes be bleed from one mic to another so if someone is yelling on one mic, then you can hear it a bit on the other mic, and so it can get a bit--

#### TIM

It comes up occasionally during the show. People occasionally yell.

#### MADDY

It's the occasional shout. Very, very minimal shouting. __[Tim sniffs, Katie chuckles]__ But occasionally it makes editing a bit difficult, 'cause if there's a kind of echo of someone else on a particular mic, it can be a bit confusing.

But when people are recording separately in different rooms, in different houses, etc. there's no mic bleed so that's good, but then also you don't know exactly when the other person is speaking and there can be a delay so that can kind of make things a little bit more confusing to edit, especially when there's more than two people. For example, the episode with Enola was a lot of fun [__TIM:__ Mm.] but also a bit confusing to edit because often someone would be speaking when someone else was in the middle of a sentence and I'd be like, "Who's replying to who? What's happening? I don't know!"

#### TIM

I'd imagine sometimes 'is it an interruption that's supposed to be happening __[Katie chuckles]__ or is it an accidental interruption that we need to get rid of?' There's no way to tell because none of the performers remember so you just __[chuckles]__ have to make a judgement call, I suppose.

#### MADDY

Yeah. Yeah, and so it was kind of make it-- It was kind of a fun jigsaw, logic puzzle of like, what makes the most sense in this situation? __[Maddy and Tim laugh]__ And it's not one that I am keen to repeat. I wouldn't mind repeating. __[laughs]__

#### TIM

Let me just have a quick look at-- Oh, there's loads of three person episodes in the next season--

##### [Maddy cheers]

#### KATIE

Yeah, there are.

#### TIM

--so look forward to that. __[Maddy and Katie laugh]__ Oh, hang on, I've just got an email thing from Maddy saying "I've--"

#### KATIE

"I quit."

#### TIM

"--quit." __[Katie chuckles]__ Okay, well, that's fine. Um... __[laughs]__ Perfect.

And, I think it would be remiss of me not to chip in my perspective on this one, in that I thought remote recordings were gonna be an absolute nightmare for improv because, obviously, so much of it is the back and forth and the bouncing and something that will kill that quicker than anything else is a laggy connection or something like that. And, yeah, congratulations to the Internet and improved video technology. Even in a three-person, three-location conversation, it's been remarkably manageable but again only because you, Maddy, then painstakingly __[Tim and Katie chuckle]__ pick through the *mess* that comes out the other end from three separate recordings and cobble it into something reasonable.

I'm gonna go out on a limb and say the final thing we're gonna discuss here, which is a bit of kit chat. Everyone loves a bit of kit chat--I know I do--because there's a lot of technology that goes into this show and the making of it and how it's all possible, so I'd like to quickly run through for anybody who gives __[Katie chuckles]__ a rat's ass what we use here.

So, all of our microphones are Audio-Technica AT2020's, I believe. I personally am on an XLR connection. Other people are on USB, which is fine, I suppose, but the audio purists among us _(husky voice)_ will know that an XLR connection is the silky smooth one we all crave. __[laughs]__ I spoke--

#### KATIE

No, this is about obviously doing the remote recording very urgently as part of the pandemic contingency and sending things out to performers that are not sound engineers, you know. __[laughs]__

#### TIM

And also, having listened to the episodes, you can't tell even the slightest bit of difference, so there's _(laughing)_ always that. Um...

And I was mixing it all through on my end initially when we did it all in one room together on a Zoom R24, I believe, which is a lovely piece of kit and it has lots of lovely backups like having an SD card inside it so if everything goes kerplunk, it's all still there. But unfortunately, the Zoom desk and Windows do not like each other, so when we started doing the Rusty Quill streams and things like that, I was very delighted to receive a Focusrite, um, I believe i2i2? Something-- Focusrite, I've got 2 XLR inputs. That one. 2i2? I'm gonna say 2i2, which is what we're using now and it's a beautiful setup and I love it very, very dearly. So that's for anybody who gave a damn about that.

#### MADDY

In terms of the tech that I use, I use REAPER as my _(exaggerated posh accent)_ digital audio workstation, as they are known. __[Katie chuckles]__ And--

#### TIM

_(mimicking exaggerated posh accent)_ A DAW. [pronounced like "a door" with the 'r' dropped] A DAW.

#### MADDY

_(joining in)_ A DAW.

#### TIM

__[chuckles]__ Not-- not one on a house though!

##### [Tim and Katie laugh in a posh way]

#### MADDY

It doesn't work in my accent but yes.

##### [Katie and Maddy laugh]

#### TIM

We have fun here. __[laughs, starts soft then gets louder]__ Oh, yeah, you're right! It doesn't!

#### KATIE

You don't know how blessed you are, actually. That can cause confusion.

#### TIM

_(crosstalk)_ Isn't culture fun.

##### [everyone laughs]

#### MADDY

But REAPER is great because it's non-destructive so you can get rid of something and then instantly think, "No, that was silly. [__KATIE:__ Preach.] I should get that straight back." Or add an effect and think, "No, that sounds terrible. Take it away again."

But I also do use Audacity because that is one that is used throughout Rusty Quill because it does have some really great plugins, like the noise reduction plugin is great, and also just to make sure that everything sounds kind of consistent across Rusty Quill. [__KATIE:__ Mm.] So, with the general processing things I tend to use Audacity but there are obviously various ways you could do the exactly the same things in REAPER but it's just-- Yeah. I've kind of got to this weird little work pattern where I use two different DAWs for very similar things but it makes sense in my own head.

#### TIM

__[laughs]__ *(smooth posh voice)* Well, as long as we get that quality audio content out the other end, we don't mind.

#### MADDY

Exactly.

#### TIM

And like, from-- This is a genuine question. This isn't even a 'we're doing an episode' question, this is just a question from me to you. From the point that you get the raw audio from us to the point that it's done-done-done, how much time would you say the actual work time is between "I've got the raw audio" and "here's a finished episode" for your average episode?

#### MADDY

Hmm. It kind of-- It varies a lot depending on especially the soundscaping and even sometimes with the vocal cut, especially if there's like, an extra guest performer on, then it might kind of take a bit more work, so... For a vocal cut it could take anything between like a couple of hours to four hours, something like that, and for a soundscape it's generally much more kind of in the four-to-eight hour mark but it can vary quite a lot. Sometimes I can speed through an episode really quickly and other times it's just like "oh, when will this episode end?" so... __[everyone laughs]__ It's like--

#### TIM

Do you keep checking like, "Ah! Twenty minutes still to go, eh? __[sighs deeply]__ Ah, okay. Well..."

##### [Tim and Maddy laugh]

#### KATIE

I mean, that sounds quite quick to me though. Like, I guess you get into a sort of rhythm, don't you?

#### MADDY

Yeah. 'Cause you generally-- Like, at the start it took a lot longer because I was working out which beeps to use when and all that [__KATIE:__ Yeah. Yeah.] kind of stuff. Whereas now I'm like, "Oh, yep, this beep goes here. That beep goes there." [__KATIE:__ Yeah.] Boom. Boom. All done. __[chuckles]__

#### TIM

But yes, I suppose what's interesting is what is quite a production light show, I suppose, in many ways because it is just here is one set of raw audio, it's normally all in one go, [__KATIE:__ Mm.] obviously in different stems but it's a contiguous thing and the soundscaping as these things go is not often--unless I'm doing a RPG episode, sorry about that--is relatively low, and even then, I imagine, easily sort of ten to fifteen hours per episode goes into actually beating it into something __[laughs]__ that you'd actually want to listen to.

#### KATIE

I suppose the difference between this show and the, um... well, certainly *Magnus*, which I've done a couple of edits on, is obviously you're not working with a script and so that is a slightly different process from the producer's point of view but, for anything else, it kind of just starts with you and Ben talking. So, I don't have to do what Lowri has to do on *Magnus,* which is spend many weeks prior to that getting scripts off the writer and get them edited by the director and finalised and all of that extra bit of work.

#### TIM

And it's a very happy situation because if you were hoping to get scripts from me, __[Katie laughs]__ you will be *sorely* disappointed. I am loath to even write a single page of script.

#### KATIE

I mean, I have attempted it from time to time so I'm aware.

##### [Katie and Tim laugh]

#### TIM

Which is shocking, because I began my relationship with Rusty Quill by pitching a show to them and I've written, I think, two or three episodes of an audio, like a full BBC radio full-style show that's currently sitting, languishing somewhere on a hard drive. So I started so script heavy, [__KATIE:__ Oh, right?] and Alex went "I don't think we'll be doing that. Tim, would you like to improvise some things?" __[Tim and Katie laugh]__ It's like, "Yeah, okay. I think that's best." __[laughs]__ I think that's best.

#### KATIE

_(crosstalk)_ Oh. I didn't know that. __[sighs]__

#### TIM

Yeah, yeah. I found it this afternoon. *Blatch House*. Nobody cares. __[inhales deeply]__ Okay, so... __[Katie and Tim laugh]__ I think that'll do it for now. __[scoffs]__ "For now" as if there's gonna be an episode two to this. That'll do it. So thank you so much for joining me here today. Katie, thank you very much. Maddy, thank you very much.

#### KATIE

Nice to be here.

#### TIM

And we'll see you all some point in the future.

#### KATIE

Bye!

#### MADDY

Buh-bye!

#### TIM

Bye! Ends. Ends of things!

#### MADDY

How do ends work?

##### [Katie and Maddy laugh]

#### TIM

How-- how do end?
