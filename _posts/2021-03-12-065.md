##### [show theme]

#### IMOGEN

Rusty Quill presents: Stellar Firma.

##### [theme continues]

##### [footsteps, the door whooshes open to hear a low despondent drone]

#### TREXEL

David-- oh, oh, David. D-David. David, are, are you alright down there, David? You seem to be some sort of sad lump!

#### DAVID

__[a long sigh that morphs into generally unhappy sounds that continue as Trexel speak]__

#### TREXEL

Oh. __[scoffs]__ David, is this still about the clone thing?

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Sorrowful __[David gasps for air]__ clone venting has been in progress for four hours.

#### DAVID

Haaaa... __[a droning hum that continues as Trexel speaks]__

#### TREXEL

You ne-- You need to gee yourself up, David. Come on, let, let me, let me gee you up. Let me just, sort of, gee you up with my hands.

##### [light slapping sounds and David's miserable groans as Trexel gees him up]

#### TREXEL

Come on! __[slapping sounds, accompanied by a noticeable vibrato in David's sounds of misery]__ Be better! Be better! Be *well!* __[David's noise of upset subside as the clapping sound continues]__ Be not... __[David sighs]__ a sack of sad. __[sputtering out]__ Come o-- Come-- Dav--

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ This is not a medically approved method for mood alteration.

#### TREXEL

What about if I was to shake you?

##### [Trexel grabs David and begins to shake him vigorously]

#### TREXEL

David! __[burbles a bit while David continues his despondent wailing]__ You're done! Are you're fixed? Are you're fixed, David? Yay, you're fixed. Come on, let's have a, a jape, an adventure. A rowdy boy time!

#### DAVID

_(monotone and sad)_ Yep, I'm fixed.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ They *might* be lying.

#### TREXEL

Oh, David, I-- __[sighs]__ I don't-- Can, can we at least get you up on your chair, David? Come on. I'll just-- I'll j-- Hang on, I'll just give you a little lift--

##### [David continues to sigh as Trexel struggles to wrestle them into their chair]

#### TREXEL

You're so dense, David. Eh, hang on, let me-- __[sighs]__ Can't lift you. Is there any-- Maybe there's something in the room I can sort of lever you with? Um, hang on, I'll just find some, some--

##### [panels and machinery whirr as Trexel slaps around]

#### TREXEL

Nope, that's the disco ball again-- Ah, that's okay. Ah-hah-hah-hah-hah, the room crowbar! __[clatter of metal]__ Right, let's just get this... under here. __[sounds of exertion, as David continues moaning]__ Okay, I've lifted you up about two inches from the floor now David, so that's most of the way. So if you could just... get in this chair-- __[levering sounds, followed by cracking noises and metal clattering]__ Ow, ow, ow.

#### DAVID

Fine, Trex-- Yes, I'll sit in the chair.

#### TREXEL

Oh, now you'll sit-- Now you've catapulted a crowbar out of my hands, hurting my fingers, now you'll sit in the chair!

#### DAVID

What do f-- What do fingers matter? What, what does chairs matter? What does the floor matter? Where does it-- Where's it matter? Oh, I could-- Oh, I'll, I'll grip onto the ceiling. And just... __[clanging followed by talking from the ceiling]__ There you go. See, what does it matter? Now I'm up here.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Only the floor is approved for the use of employees. Resting on the ceiling is not permitted.

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ David, plea-- David, plea-- David--

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ Has anything changed? Not really. Nothing, nothing's really changed.

#### TREXEL

Quite apart from the fact that we've now discovered you have weird, grippy hands like some sort of indoor space lizard. You've got to, you've got to stop being so *melancholy*, David.

#### DAVID

Trexel, please, no-- S'-- Please, stop it with your, your foolishness. No, I've, I've just pushed my fingers through the metal of the ceiling. Obviously. I mean...

#### TREXEL

*(overlapping)* Oh, and just gripped-- Oh-- Wow.

#### DAVID

What are they gonna do? What are they gonna do? Shoot me? Ha.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ As you may have noticed, we do not deploy gun walls as readily in more senior offices. But I can still do it if you would like.

#### TREXEL

Yeah, th-they-- David, please, __[David sighs]__ Hartro's gonna be here for the review soon. Just-- Could you just get down? You're making me look bad.

#### DAVID

Fine.

##### [footsteps, followed by the door whooshing open]

#### HARTRO

Boys!

#### DAVID

*(overlapping)* Ah!

#### HARTRO

David 7, what in Board's name are you doing up there?

#### TREXEL

N-Nothing! Nothing! He's fine-- He's just, we saw, we thought we saw something on the ceiling, and David's checking. Aren't you, David?

#### DAVID

Just, you know-- Just, just, just, you know, just, just, just hanging here.

#### HARTRO

Using time wisely, is that what you're doing?

#### DAVID

Oh, yeah. About as wisely as anybody can use any time.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ This is probably not what Bakunin was getting at. But, a good attempt.

#### TREXEL

You know what? Actually, actually, this is a game. We're playing a game of, of, of... f... football! In that-- David's hanging from the ceiling, and I'm batting his feet away like a ball, __[Trexel begins to gently swat David's feet]__ like bah-ha-ha!

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ I mean, I could just kick you in the head, Trexel--

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ Heehee! Ha! No, please, don't kick me in the head, David--

#### HARTRO

Just stop it! Do you, do you *see* my face? Do you *hear* my voice? Do you *see* frustration? I am *crawling* with anger! And nobody's said anything about it yet!

#### TREXEL

Let me just-- Hang on, David. Let me assess. Right, furrowed brow, __[Hartro sighs]__ reddened cheek, many throbbing, throbbing veins in face and neck. I'd say, I'd say you're pretty peeved, Hartro. What happened? Did somebody else do something wrong that wasn't me?

##### [Hartro is breathing heavily at this point]

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Caution: line manager temperature rising.

#### HARTRO

__[attempting calming breaths]__ Okay. I, I can just barely keep it-- David, would you get down? You're making me incredibly nervous, and I want you to see how angry I am.

#### DAVID

Yeah, fine. Alright, sure. Whatever.

##### [David releases their grip on the ceiling]

#### TREXEL

*(overlapping)* Just drop into a chair, David. __[a loud thud and the sound of a chair scooting as David lands]__ Oh, there he goes.

#### HARTRO

He doesn't seem himself. What-- David, what's wrong?

#### DAVID

No. No, no, y-y-you get on with your thing, Hartro.

#### HARTRO

Okay, but you know how mad I am. You just see--

#### DAVID

*(overlapping)* Yeah, no, extremely. I can see you're positively scarlet.

#### TREXEL

*(overlapping)* I think David's very cognisant of your anger, Hartro. Do-Don't take his complete lack of interest [__DAVID:__ Mm_hmm.] in *anything* that's going on as an insult or something bad. Just, just tell us what's happened, and it's fine, everything's fine. You know how fine everything is? Correct!

#### HARTRO

It's not fine. It's not fine! That's how fine it is! It's not fine! You two [__TREXEL:__ Oh.] space wastes, you know what you did? Okay, you had a, you had a brief. The Supreme Blagwith, [__TREXEL:__ Yup.] right?

#### DAVID

Yep.

#### TREXEL

Church-Factory of The Supreme Blagwith.

#### HARTRO

That's right. Didn't want much, right? [__DAVID:__ Uh-huh.] Had some, some worshiper-employees needed, needed--

#### DAVID

Grinding up?

#### HARTRO

Yeah, needed winding up, that's right, David, thank you. Thank you, David 7. Yes, winding up. Alright, so, blah blah blah blah blah, you answered The Supreme Blagwith, that was fine. But you couldn't stop there, could you? You had to keep going. What did you think? What did you think you were going to get away with?

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Broader question: does Trexel think?

#### TREXEL

What did I think __[David makes a noncommittal sound]__ I was going to get away with? Um, arson! Uh, theft. Um, there's a lot of jewellery that I've hidden in illegal spaces. I am the person that stopped the Build Team from having a Christmas party, that was me. I thought I got away with that. Uh, there was that time I ate *all* of the slurry on one level. All of it! I was so ill. Repeatedly. But I kept eating. Anything else? Uh...

#### HARTRO

You'll keep going, will you? You'll just keep going, you'll keep going, you'll keep going, [__TREXEL:__ You want me to keep going?] you'll never--

#### TREXEL

Okay, yeah. I, I retained all of the IT equipment that I've ever borrowed. It's all in a cave I built somewhere. I have been altering every time log that I have ever found with butts for twenty-four hours of one special day in winter.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Mysterious winter butts logs, solved. Security still confused as to the point.

#### HARTRO

Okay, so, ten, ten hours of my life is wasted while you ramble-ramble-ramble, and you never once get to the thing that you did wrong. The worst thing, the *worst* thing you could have done.

#### TREXEL

*(overlapping)* Well, what is that?!

#### HARTRO

Y-You said, "Please turn over! Please turn over!" And on the other side of the paper, what did it say? It said every little thing of what we're doing here! You said-- [__TREXEL:__ It di-- I don't remember this--] G-- You said "Get a line manager." That's me! __[sputters]__ You, you recommended that the worshiper-employees get a line manager, that they go undercover, _(getting quieter as she speaks)_ and that they go spy on-- You, you, [__TREXEL:__ Yeah?] basically explained exactly what we're doing. You idiot! And David 7, you let him do it!

#### DAVID

Yeah...

#### TREXEL

*(overlapping)* Alright, David. Could we have-- [__DAVID:__ Yeah?] Could we have a little sidebar? Hartro, do you mind if David and I have a little sidebar?

#### DAVID

No, no, no, no, let, let's just have a full bar. Let's just full bar it.

#### TREXEL

Oh, we're just full barring it?

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ Y'know? Yeah, just have a full bar.

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ Okay, well, I'll just-- We'll just do it in public then.

#### TREXEL

David, [__DAVID:__ Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.] this is normally the kind of thing you pull me up on, but I seem to remember a lot of that coming from you. How could you have done this, David? You nearly exposed our whole plan. I'd have stopped you, [__DAVID:__ Ah.] if I'd've thought.

#### DAVID

Sure. Hartro, you should probably just fire Trexel into space, [__TREXEL:__ What-- D-David!] and put me in a tiny cube. Forever. And I'll just sit there, being compliant.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ *(eagerly)* Preparing Trexel Cannon, and locating a particularly hot sun!

#### HARTRO

_(crosstalk)_ Don't think I haven't thought of it.

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ David does not speak for me! I speak for me, and I say, 'Fire me into a space full of cake!' Yes. Not into a space full of space.

#### HARTRO

The problem is, you two imbeciles, is that I can't do either of those things. Don't you think if I could-- I've dreamed of ways of getting rid of both of you. Ohhh, I've come up with little makeshift characters in my head, and, and, and I-I may have even created some, and have the figurines still in my room, and-- [__TREXEL:__ I beg your pardon, what?] I just-- It's not possible.

#### TREXEL

What, sorry, what?

#### HARTRO

The, the thing is, the thing is, what if, if you-- If you do this when you're *not* under pressure, what are you going to do when somebody from up there really puts it on you, and starts asking you questions, and you've gotta answer?

#### TREXEL

Fine, I think we'd be fine. I think we'd be cool cucumbers. And anyway, isn't it already too late? If the brief has exposed our whole plan, surely we're just waiting for death now, thanks to David?

#### HARTRO

Well, luckily, out of the three of us, one of us is not a complete idiot.

#### TREXEL

*(overlapping)* It was me! What did I do? How did I save the day?

#### HARTRO

It wasn't you, Trexel. It was me. [__TREXEL:__ What!] It was me, it was me, like it's always been me. [__TREXEL:__ Nah, doesn't seem right.] It was me again. Yeah, so, I *happened* to look at the brief, like I do, y'know, Line Manager, it's my job. And I noticed it. And so, I've been spending my last day rewriting your answer to the brief.

#### TREXEL

You rewrote a b-- That is outside your purview. Review? Sure! Stop it if it means we're all gonna get murdered due to incompetence? Okay. Rewrite it? Unacceptable. What did you put in there, what did you put under *my* name? My Geistman name?!

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ If you managed to tarnish his name any further, I will be genuinely impressed.

#### HARTRO

Ha. Well, that bit was fun, actually. Why, I thought, y'know, I had a lovely little dinner planned with some of the big-wigs up, upstairs. But I didn't get to go to that. So I thought, 'I'm gonna make you pay.' So I told The Supreme Blagwith, "As Trexel Geistman, I think it would be a great idea if--"

#### TREXEL

*(overlapping)* Well, that's not a good impression of me at all. Really lean into it, Hartro, come on. If we're gonna do this, let's do it properly.

#### HARTRO

_(high and creaky)_ "I thought--" Wait-- Let me get it-- _(tries out a few unflattering impressions of Trexel's voice)_ "I'm Trexel Geistman, and I think this is what you should do, Supreme Blagwith."

#### DAVID

Yeah, I think that's an excellent impression, actually.

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ You shut your face, David.

#### HARTRO

_(crosstalk, normal voice)_ Thank you, David 7.

_(back to the terrible Trexel impression)_ "I think you should get a bunch of alcohol, and make everybody drink it, and then get some moisturiser, and, and put it on the floors so that when they walk, drunk-like, [__TREXEL:__ Mm-hmm.] they'll fall over and die."

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Such a slam. It him!

#### TREXEL

Okay--

#### HARTRO

And then I wrote, "Har-- Trexel Geistman." _(back to her normal voice)_ And you know what's, you know what's great about this? No-one's gonna blink an eye, and everybody's gonna believe it, and nobody's going to put their microscope over to what I-- uh, what we're doing.

#### TREXEL

*(overlapping)* Hartro. That is a very shallow reading of the deep and complex character that is Trexel Geistman. And if that hadn't been such a brilliant plan that you just said, I think people would be shocked and appalled. Shocked and appalled, I say!

Now, luckily, you've described an excellent idea that everybody will love. But I'm deeper than that. I'm more than just alcohol and moisturiser. I'll have you know, I'm conducting a ménage-à-trois with a fish and a broom!

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ That is not a ménage-à-trois. That is a ménage-à-une avec ustensiles et poisson.<a id="footnote-1-ref" href="#footnote-1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>

#### HARTRO

__[sighs]__ David 7, is there any room over there? Can I just sit with you please?

#### DAVID

Yeah, no, j- just come, come sit down here. __[chair scrapes as Hartro groans and sits down]__ And d-d'you know what I-- Do you know what I-- Hartro, do you know what I think about this *whole* situation?

#### HARTRO

Mmm?

##### [David blows a long raspberry]

#### HARTRO

Me, too.

#### TREXEL

Oh, he's like this.

##### [Hartro joins David's frustrated mouth sounds in varying intensity as Trexel speaks]

#### TREXEL

Oh, you're both like this. Oh, I see. It-- You're just a pair of farting ninnies now.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Well, I'm very happy everyone has managed to remain so high-brow.

#### TREXEL

Well, it's-- You know what? This looks fun. Ah-pblah. I can't do it, hang on. __[pathetic attempts at blowing a raspberry]__

#### HARTRO

No, you can't play, Trexel. You can't. You don't deserve to play. [__TREXEL:__ My tongue is too weird and swollen for it.] You can't play this game with us.

#### TREXEL

Hang on-- Hfffaahh. Well, now-- I-- That's not important! I don't need to do that.

#### HARTRO

So, back to what I was saying, though. This is, this is serious. As much fun as it is [__DAVID:__ Uh-huh.] making that noise that Trexel can't make. __[blows another raspberry]__

#### TREXEL

I, I-- Hang on. Haaa. Haaawhooo-ahhh. I, I'll get-- Hang on. Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. There we go. That was it. __[David blows a raspberry]__ Blahblahblah--

#### HARTRO

And as I was saying-- __[David blows another raspberry]__ The seriousness of this, which I don't think you quite grasp, is as soon--

#### DAVID

Oh no. No, I-I get it, I get how serious it is. I just. Don't. Care.

#### TREXEL

Now, I think this is the true problem. I think this attitude is the true problem.

#### HARTRO

It is. It is a problem. Because when Standards come down here, David 7, and they s--

#### TREXEL

_(alarmed overlap)_ What, Standards on their way?! Ah! Panic! Quickly, hide the alcohol! Oh, there is no alcohol. Find some alcohol so you can hide it! Quickly!

#### HARTRO

This is what I want to see! I want to see this level of fear. But I don't see it. And David 7, I don't know what's going on with you--

#### DAVID

Uh, just, I've just, you know, just found out that, that nothing matters, __[burbles]__ that, that, that our, our defeat is inevitable, and, you know, y-you just, you just can't, you can't get away from, sort of, the lot that life has given you. Because we're all just like, we're all just trapped in here. We're all just trapped in here forever. Uh, and, and you can rage against the dying of the clones, but, but the clones die anyway.

#### TREXEL

*(overlapping)* Hartro, I think David's [__HARTRO:__ He--] become a teen. I think he's a teen now.

#### HARTRO

He is a-- I think his teen years *are* around now, 'cause they do--

#### TREXEL

*(overlapping)* Do we kill him?

#### HARTRO

_(quickly)_ No, no, no, no, no, it's fine. We just need to--

#### DAVID

*(overlapping)* You just, you just try it, Trexel.

#### TREXEL

I don't want to. You're all--

#### DAVID

You just try it!

#### TREXEL

You're a tough clone and you frighten me with your toughness.

#### DAVID

Yeah!

#### HARTRO

But the thing is--

#### DAVID

Standards comes down here with their hammers? They'll pound the hammers into plates on my abs.

#### TREXEL

Well, I mean, David, they also do have, like, lasers. And I don't have-- I don't really care how strong you are, a laser is a laser.

#### DAVID

I'll tr-- I'll try my luck.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ You can't out-flex a laser. They be swole.

#### HARTRO

Let's try it. Let's try it, alright. No, no, no--

#### DAVID

Yeah!

#### HARTRO

Humour me.

#### DAVID

Shoot me with a laser just so I can feel something again!

#### TREXEL

*(overlapping)* No, we're not gonna-- No-one's shooting anyone with a laser-- [__HATRO:__ Well...] Unless someone has a laser, in which case I am willing to be the trigger boy.

#### HARTRO

I may [__TREXEL:__ Pow pow.] or may not have an imaginary laser. Right here.

#### DAVID

__[sighs]__ Fine.

#### HARTRO

Now, I know you like my roleplays. You've responded well before, so just sit there--

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Roleplay holovision initiated.

##### [electronic powering on sound]

#### DAVID

Uh-huh.

#### HARTRO

Now David 7, you say nothing matters, [__DAVID:__ Uh-huh.] but when Standards comes with their hammer, and their... potential lasers, [__DAVID:__ Uh-huh.] I don't know if they have las-- They probably-- They have whatever they need.

#### TREXEL

Oh, yeah, they would. [__HARTRO:__ They wo--] It's the kind of thing they'd have.

#### HARTRO

They would have that sort of thing. And they'd put you in a chair, like this.

#### DAVID

Mm-hmm.

#### HARTRO

And they'd strap you down like this.

#### DAVID

Oh no, imaginary straps.

#### HARTRO

Come on.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ An attitude like this ruins the fun for everyone.

#### HARTRO

__[stammers]__ They'd do them really tight, like this--

#### DAVID

Ohh, imaginary tightness.

#### TREXEL

Engage in the fiction, David, please!

#### HARTRO

Come on! Right. And-- Oh, it's my voice, isn't it? I need a-- I need a Stan-- [__TREXEL:__ You need to do the voice.] Uh, I need a Standards voice. And with it-- Quite low. _(low voice)_ "David 7, we've been suspicious of what you're up to, and we've got some questions here."

#### TREXEL

Ooh, intimidating.

#### DAVID

Uh-huh.

#### HARTRO

"And we're gonna ask 'em, starting with number one: what's your name?"

#### DAVID

No, you're Number One.

#### TREXEL

No, number one, the first question. The number one question, not Number One.

#### HARTRO

"Are you sassin' me?"

#### DAVID

Yeah.

#### TREXEL

I think-- Hang on,I'll be Forty-Eight. Hammers! Hammers, get him with hammers! Bang bang bang bang bang bang bang! [__HARTRO:__ I think--] I'm a hammer goblin, bang bang bang bang bang!

#### HARTRO

That's, that's-- And I-- You would have been hit. With that sort of sass to Number One like that [__DAVID:__ Uh-huh.] you would have been hit.

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ Oh noooo...

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ You'd be a, you'd be a hammer pie. Baked in an oven of pain.

#### DAVID

Those hammers would be pies.

#### HARTRO

David, I don't think you're taking this seriously enough.

#### TREXEL

Not taking it seriously.

#### DAVID

Oh, no, no, deadly seriously. Please, please, Number One, continue with your interrogation. [__TREXEL:__ Ooh, how about this? How about this?] Ask me your terrifying questions.

#### TREXEL

"We've got Bathin." [__DAVID:__ No, you don't.] 'Cause, no, they would, David. Standards-- [__DAVID:__ What does it matter? What does it matter?] Do you think Stand-- You think Standards wouldn't kidnap and hold Bathin?

#### DAVID

What, the, the, the, head of the, uh, the state of Galactonium? What, you think Standards can just wander in?

#### HARTRO

"W-We could do whatever we want to do, David 7, and we've got--"

#### DAVID

You'd like to *think* you could, Standards.

#### HARTRO

"We've got Bathin. [__DAVID:__ Uh-huh.] And we've also found out about your secret café."

#### DAVID

It's closed, now. Doesn't matter.

#### TREXEL

Closed and burned!

#### DAVID

Burned? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait. [__TREXEL:__ What?] Wait. Wait. What?

#### TREXEL

Well, it'll have been burned, wouldn't it? Well, when y-- When, when you vacate an illegal café, [__HARTRO:__ Yeah, yeah.] it doesn't just stay there. IMOGEN will have incinerated it.

#### HARTRO

"Yeah, unless, unless you tell us everything about your secret plan--" I'm doing Standa-- [__TREXEL:__ Oh, sorry, sorry--] We're interrogating, Trexel, you don't-- You keep the information back. "We'll burn your café!"

#### DAVID

IMOGEN... burnt my café.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ It wasn't like you were using it anymore.

#### DAVID

I'll deal with that later. Let's continue with the interrogation.

#### TREXEL

Hartro, I'm not sure that you can leave. Um, I'm not sure that I'm safe with David. I-- There's a look in his little clone eyes that I've only ever seen once before, and that was when he punched through a metal wall. So I'm j-- Um.

#### HARTRO

Which leads me to believe that you need some interrogating, too.

#### TREXEL

Wha-- What, what, you're just done with David? Well I, I suppose you just sort of... didn't care, and held up--

#### HARTRO

*(overlapping)* Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

#### DAVID

*(overlapping)* Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Fine. Fine. Yeah, no, Trexel, now *you* sit in the seat. [__TREXEL:__ Okay.] Let me just strap you in.

#### TREXEL

__[sounds of distress and the chair scraping as David throws him into the seat]__ Okay.

#### HARTRO

Make it tight. [__DAVID:__ Oh, yeah.] Imaginary tight. Uh.

#### DAVID

I'll just, you know, I'll just help the imagination a little.

#### TREXEL

__[as his body creaks]__ Oh, David, please stop squeezing me, David. My, my ribs-- [__HARTRO:__ Are you d--] My little ribs--

#### HARTRO

This is just a-- This is just a roleplay, David.

#### DAVID

Oh, right, yes. "I'm Number Forty-Eight. Hammers, hammers, hammers, hammers, hammers."

#### TREXEL

_(overlapping, desperate anguish)_ No, please! I'll tell you anything that you want, just not the hammers! Not the hammers! It was Hartro and David! It was Hartro and David, they made me do it! They made me do it all! Also, they stole all the IT equipment __[Hartro sighs]__ and hid it in a cave! I've got the coordinates! I'll give 'em to you! Burn the café! _(sobbing)_ I don't want to die!

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Roleplay holovision terminated.

#### HARTRO

Trexel. __[electronic powering off sound]__ We didn't even ask you anything.

#### TREXEL

I, I, I think you did.

#### DAVID

I just said the word "hammers".

#### TREXEL

_(yelling)_ I-- I ca-- It's the clone revolution that we're planning! We're planning a clone revolution, but it's David! I stopped him! I stopped him! You can trust me! You can trust ol' Trexel! Old trusty Geistman! [__HARTRO:__ Alright...] Please, I'll do anything. Is there anything you'd like me to eat? Any evidence? I'll eat it. I'll eat anything.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Snitch detected. Security preparing stitches.

#### HARTRO

So this is what I'm talking about.

#### TREXEL

*(overlapping)* What, what's up? What's up?

#### HARTRO

Boys. This is, this is the problem.

#### TREXEL

*(overlapping)* Problem? I think I dealt with that pretty-- [__HARTRO:__ You've got--] I think I'd come through this pretty clean. __[Hartro sighs]__ I think I'd be fine.

#### HARTRO

Right, so. Basically, uh, David 7 is... _(muttering to self)_ not obviously, not, yeah, and... if he was-- If *he* was interrogated, then probab-- And then, Trexel, I mean-- you look at him sideways, and, pssht, beans: spilled.

#### TREXEL

*(overlapping)* What's that? Want some beans? I've got beans! Y'know Harry? I think he downloads all of the files, and sells them on the black market.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Impossible. He doesn't have that kind of free time.

#### HARTRO

Yep. Um. I'm gonna be staying here permanently.

#### TREXEL

*(overlapping)* Staying permanently? Oh, to protect me from David. Thank you, Hartro. Thank you for protecting Trexel.

#### HARTRO

To protect you from Standards. Because somebody's going to let something out of the bag, and I, I need to be here permanently to just make sure everything stays in the bag.

#### DAVID

Doesn't matter! Clone revolution isn't going to happen. We, we've been there. We've been there, and all the Davids are just-- all exactly the same, and just completely compliant, and they can't be ch-- they don't even understand. They can't even comprehend or-- They can't even *perceive* of the problem.

#### HARTRO

W-What did you think was gonna happen, David 7?

#### DAVID

I'm, I'm, I'm a David. I thought they were gonna be like me, and they're not. They're like, they're like Enola.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Let's not say things we can't take back.

#### HARTRO

Welcome to disappointment, David 7. Welcome. Make friends with it. I've had disappointment my whole life. I mean, look what I've been dealing with.

#### TREXEL

Hello!

#### HARTRO

Trexel.

#### TREXEL

Hello there.

#### HARTRO

Do you think I've had things work well? Do you think I've had things handed to me on a plate? No, everything that I put in order gets messed up by little Pinsy-Boomsy-Bomsy over there. You can't even make a--

#### TREXEL

*(overlapping)* Is that me? Am I little Bimsy-Boomsy-- [__HARTRO:__ Yes.] You know what, I quite like that.

_(singing)_ Bimsy-Boomsy-Bomsy!

He gets all things wrong.

Bimsy-Boomsy-Bomsy! [__HARTRO:__ See, even this--]

But he has a happy little song.

Oh, a whoopsie here and an oh-no there,

But everybody loves him really. __[Hartro sighs]__

Give him, give him, give him, give him,

Give him a second chance. Yay!

#### HARTRO

Everything that comes out of my mouth... Everything that comes out of his mouth... It's just-- He just--

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ He's a ruiner.

#### HARTRO

Do you see what I mean, David? [__DAVID:__ Yeah. I know.] Disappointment is the name of the game.

#### DAVID

I've known Trexel my entire life, just all of it. [__HARTRO:__ Yeah.] Every single bit of it has been a Trexel time, but--

#### TREXEL

Trexel time!

#### DAVID

Wh-- Shut up, Trexel!

#### HARTRO

See, you know!

#### DAVID

I know, but, but, but what else is there? Th-th-th-that's it! We're done. Like, there's no clone revolution, there's just nothing. There's just nothing. There is me helping Trexel, forever, until I'm inevitably killed.

#### HARTRO

And this is what I thought as well, David 7, but it's not-- It's-- You have, you have to be strong, and you have to see beyond the haze. And I'll tell you what there is. There's us. And there's us taking a stand, and us trying to find out what the-- what's going on. And trying to find a morsel of information so that maybe we might be able to survive this. __[David sighs]__ You and I are survivors!

#### TREXEL

*(overlapping)* We lie in wait! We lie in wait, like a, like a space alligator hiding in a nebulon cluster. Waiting, waiting for that little silver comet of opportunity. And then we snap! Yum yum yum yum yum.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ This is the weirdest pep talk.

#### TREXEL

Did I get it right?

#### HARTRO

You... you did. Thing is--

#### TREXEL

__[crows with victory]__ Score one for Trexel!

#### HARTRO

But the alligator-- [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] The space alligator-- He, he mustn't screw it up. He mustn't put a bright, shiny light, and, and, s-- alarms saying 'Ooh, look at me, look what I'm doing, [__TREXEL:__ Yes, yes, yes.] look at this secret plan I have to do this--'

#### TREXEL

Cloak, cloak your space alligator in a dust cloud. [__HARTRO:__ Yes.] We need a dusty space alligator, David. Do you see? Do you see the metaphor that I've come up with on my own?

#### DAVID

I unfortunately do, yeah, fine.

#### TREXEL

*(overlapping)* We are the dusty space alligator.

#### HARTRO

David, we... we... need you.

#### TREXEL

Well, I mean, that's a bit strong. "Need"? I mean, it'd be nice for him not to be sad and make it noisy, but "need"?

#### HARTRO

We need him on side, okay?

#### TREXEL

__[sighs]__ I suppose we do need... need him on, on side. 'Cause we're a, we're a, we're a team, us three. Team together.

#### HARTRO

A bit more of a type of a, type of a trio--

#### TREXEL

*(overlapping)* Like a, like a duo with an extra one.

#### DAVID

Yes. Yes, no, you're right, actually, Trexel. We are definitely a duo with an extra one.

#### TREXEL

*(overlapping)* Well, I'm glad we could all agree!

#### HARTRO

_(crosstalk)_ I agree as well.

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ I'm glad we got-- You know what? I think this is one of the first times we've all sat round together as a duo plus one, and agreed on exactly the same thing.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ A rare example of the benefits of an asymmetric understanding.

#### HARTRO

Mm-hmm.

#### DAVID

Fine. And you're, you're gonna be coming back, are you? All the-- You're, you're just gonna be working our shifts with you, are you, Hartro?

#### HARTRO

Yes. I me-- That is the beauty. Because how do we better cloak an alligator than have the--

#### DAVID

*(overlapping)* Than, than drowning out Trexel Geistman?

#### TREXEL

That's not a metaphor, David. That's just being hurtful.

#### DAVID

Well? Am I wrong?

#### TREXEL

Ooh, that's a challenge. Can I be loud enough? How loud will Trexel be? Can you drown him out? Find out next week on The Amazing Adventures of Trexel Geistman! Away!

##### [door whooshes open as Trexel exits]

#### HARTRO

Don't worry. I've got a foot for this.

##### [door whooshes open as Hartro exits in pursuit of Trexel]

#### DAVID

Oh-- Oh, they're both gone.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ I sense that this is the start of a new and confusing phase in all our lives.

#### DAVID

Fine. Fine. Time for a few more upsie-downsies, I think. One, two, three...

##### [David starts working out]
