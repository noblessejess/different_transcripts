#### DAVID

__[clears throat and coughs a few times]__ Hello. And welcome to... _(singing badly)_ ♪ David's... Fact Corner! Where I'm... David 7! With facts! ♫ The number one and... only, um, audio blog from... me, David 7, where I... Da-- David 7, bring you... facts! N-Not about David 7. About other-- other things.

Um-- Episode 1: The, um, The Tallest Structure in the Universe.

The tallest known structure in the universe was a statue built by the Vizitite people of the, um, the Kremling belt during the Age of the Expanding Grasp. Uh, th-the statue was built in the likeness of their, their beloved ruler, um, Kehelmotite the Modest, a ruler so incapable of accepting any sort of compliment, uh, that, that their adoring people drove their civilisation into ruin in ever-escalating attempts to demonstrate their love for them.

The statue, uh, stood half an astronomical unit high and consumed the material wealth of the entire Vizitite empire. Um, a-and when it was completed i-it so altered the orbit of their home world and the bodies nearby that it collided __[chuckles]__ with a small moon that had been carved into the shape of the head of Kehelmotite 22 years previously. _(amused)_ *Ironic.*

Um, in the final moments before impact Kehelmotite was recorded, uh, to have said that, um, __[chuckles]__ "honestly they needn't have gotten me anything." Also ironic.

Okay. Um... that-- that's... that's the fact! Um... so... thank you for listening to, um, _(sings)_ ♪ David's Fact Corner, where I give you a fact! ♫ Um, and, uh, see you next fact! Bye!
