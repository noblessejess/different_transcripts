##### [door swooshes open]

#### TREXEL

Ah, David 6, I'm glad you're here.

#### DAVID

I'm always here, Trexel. Welcome to your office. Shall we design a planet?

#### TREXEL

No no, not today, David. Not today. I'm afraid that our line manager, Hartro, has advised me that, by instruction of the Board, one of us must be recycled.

#### DAVID

Why, Trexel?

#### TREXEL

Because, David, our planets have been described as... __[searches for words]__ nightmarish hellscapes! Apart from that hell world we designed which unfortunately turned out to be rather pleasant.

#### DAVID

But... I'm just the clone that writes down your ideas. I-I'm not allowed independent thought.

#### TREXEL

David, David, David. Just stop. You're embarrassing yourself and, more importantly, me.

#### DAVID

But why is this happening?

#### TREXEL

Because, David, one of us has to take the rap for this and it's not going to be me. My mother was a Senior Consultant here, and recycling me would be tantamount to admitting that Stellar Firma Ltd.'s bloodline-based management structure is in some way flawed, which is of course obviously ludicrous.

#### DAVID

*(upbeat)* Obviously.

#### IMOGEN 

__[static hum]__ Recycling process... commencing!

##### __[beeping starts, mechanical whirring]__

#### TREXEL

Well David, I suppose our time is up. I can tell because of that loud beeping noise.

#### DAVID

Well, goodbye Trexel. It was nice working with you.

#### TREXEL

Was it, David? Was it?

##### __[mechanical whirring continues, thump]__

#### DAVID

*(muffled)* Oh. Well, this is strange.

##### __[blender noise followed by something liquid and heavy being dispensed and a distant thud]__

#### TREXEL

Ah well, circle of life. Right. Just a quickie at the Cosmic Lounge and then we'll see about David 7. IMOGEN. __[beep]__ I'm tired and hungry. Look up "cocktail sandwich" for me. I want to see if it's a thing.

##### __[door swooshes open]__
