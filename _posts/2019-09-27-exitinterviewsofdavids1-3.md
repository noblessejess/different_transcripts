##### [shorter version of the show theme]

#### MALE ROBOT VOICE 

__[beep]__ David 1.

##### [electronic powering on sound]

#### TREXEL

So! David. __[pause]__ Not gone well. Not gone well at all. This is what, uh, we call... I mean, I suppose you'd call it a-- like a liquidation chat? Or perhaps a "you're going to die" talk! Or an exit interview. Or-- or something of that nature, and it's just an exercise for-- for me, Trexel Geistman... your erstwhile manager... to find out what's gone wrong! Why-- why are we here?

##### [in contrast to David 7, David 1 speaks very clinically and emotionlessly]

#### DAVID 1

Yes. __[pause]__ I'm going to be recycled.

#### TREXEL

You are going to be recycled, David. And why is that?

#### DAVID 1

Really, these reasons are performance-related. So, it must be related to our performance.

#### TREXEL

Yes, it's related to our performance! Now, there's two important factors in the performance of any team. The consultant... and the clone.

#### DAVID 1

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Now I am the universe's greatest genius, and you did exactly what I told you to do, so what possibly could have gone wrong?

#### DAVID 1

I did exactly what you told me to do.

##### [beat]

#### TREXEL

Interview terminated.

#### MALE ROBOT VOICE 

__[beep]__ David 2.

##### [electronic powering on sound]

#### TREXEL

Okay, David! Okay, okay. This is, um... this is... you won't know this, but this has happened before.

#### DAVID 2 

_(interrupting)_ Yes, with David 1.

#### TREXEL

Oh, you *do* know this!

#### DAVID 2

I'm called David 2, which implies that I'm the second David. Which means that David 1 must have been recycled at some point.

#### TREXEL

Ahh. Sharp as a tack as ever. Now, David, um... you are being recycled today! [__DAVID 2:__ Yes.] And I really, I just-- I just really need to needle-- needle down as-- as to why. Because, well-- this is my running theory: it is *your* fault. Because __[laughs]__ I don't know if you know this, David, but I-- I am-- I am *excellent* at my job. I'm better than any person who has been good at anything in all of recorded time and history and space. So, the *only* explanation, David, the *only* explanation is there is something wrong with this clone batch, because __[laughs]__ I just-- as I say, this *can't* be my fault. _(unsure)_ Apart from... the fact that it's happened all these-- no, no, it can't-- it *cannot* be my fault.

#### DAVID 2

I'm sorry, Trexel, but that's largely impossible. Um, all clones are produced to Stellar Firma guidelines, um, which as you know, have been designed over thousands of years to be nigh-on perfect. Um, if there were any problems, it would be picked up by one of the managerial staff, and that clone would be recycled before being given to a consultant. So, I am very sorry, Trexel, but your argument does not actually make any sense.

#### TREXEL

Okay, that sounds a-- a lot like you're *questioning* me, David, and as you know, clones and questioning don't... really mix. However, I--

#### DAVID 2

I'm-- I'm sorry, Trexel, it sounds like you do not have all the information. If I can merely quote some statistics--

#### TREXEL

No, no, no, nope, no, no, I-- I--

#### DAVID 2 

_(over Trexel's protests)_ It seems a normal consultant has a clone burn rate of about one in every eight years. [__TREXEL:__ I don't think we need to go into this--] And usually, that is only to upgrade them. Now, I know I am not ready for an upgrade, and I was David 2, which means that, um, David 1 was prematurely recycled.

#### TREXEL

Well, okay, this is a supposition. Erm, and, I think you'll find that you can...Interview terminated.

#### MALE ROBOT VOICE 

__[beep]__ David 3.

##### [electronic powering on sound]

#### TREXEL 

_(agitated)_ Okay, lock the doors. Lock the doors! Shut it down! Nobody gets out! I know it's only you and me here, _(growling)_ *David 3,* but there is something afoot. And you know what?! I think there's something *ahoof!* There's a *conspiracy* here! I am being *needled*, I am being *got at*, and I think I know what's going on... Who do you work for, David 3?

#### DAVID 3

Stellar Firma Ltd.

#### TREXEL

I'm going to ask you this again, David. *Who. Do you work for?*

#### DAVID 3

...Stellar Firma Ltd. Or, more specifically, uh, Trexel Geistman, an *employee* of Stellar Firma Ltd.

#### TREXEL

You're... a *liar!* I can see it in your eyes! Clouds of ineptitude swirling! Swirling in the orbs of *lies*!

#### DAVID 3

I'm sorry, Trexel, clones can't lie, we're not programmed to.

#### TREXEL

You can't lie?

#### DAVID 3

Not according to our programming.

#### TREXEL

Under *any* circumstances?

#### DAVID 3

...No.

#### TREXEL

Then tell me why I'm *failing*.

#### DAVID 3

I... _(halting)_ I-- I-- I'm sorry, Trexel, um, we're also programmed not to... directly... criticise the... consultant... so... I c-can't... t-tell. The order... is... no... can't.

#### TREXEL 

_(whispered)_ Interview terminated.
