#### ALEX

Hi everyone, Alex again. We hope you've enjoyed the special content we've been running during the season break for Stellar Firma. This is just a quick update to let you all know that Season 2 will be available to the public on December 6th, 2019. In the meantime, if you'd like to submit an episode suggestion, be sure to join our Patreon via the website or via the link in the show notes. For now, though, we're going to continue with the specials, and so with that in mind, we hope you enjoy today's: the first of the exit interviews.

##### [shorter version of the show theme]

##### [activation beep]

#### MALE ROBOT VOICE

David 1.

##### [electronic activation sound]

#### TREXEL

So! David. __[pause]__ Not gone well. Not gone well at all. This is what, uh, we call... __[stutters]__ I suppose you'd call it like a liquidation chat? Or perhaps a "you're going to die" talk! Or an exit interview. Or-- or something of that major, and it's just an exercise for me, Trexel Geistman... your erstwhile manager... to find out what's gone wrong! Why-- why are we here?

##### [in contrast to David 7, David 1 speaks very clinically and emotionlessly.]

#### DAVID 1

Yes. __[pause]__ I'm going to be recycled.

#### TREXEL

You are going to be recycled, David. And why is that?

#### DAVID 1

Really, these reasons are performance-related. So, it must be related to our performance.

#### TREXEL

Yes, it's related to our performance! Now, there's two important factors in the performance of any team. The consultant... and the clone.

#### DAVID 1

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Now I am the universe's greatest genius, and you did exactly what I told you to do, so what possibly could have gone wrong?

#### DAVID 1

I did exactly what you told me to do.

##### [long pause]

#### TREXEL

Interview terminated.

##### [electronic powering-down sound]

##### [activation beep]

#### MALE ROBOT VOICE

David 2.

##### [electronic activation sound]

#### TREXEL

Okay, David! Okay, okay. This is, um... this is... you won't know this, but this has happened before.

#### DAVID 2 [interrupting

] Yes, with David 1.

#### TREXEL

Oh, you *do* know this!

#### DAVID 2

I'm called David 2, which implies that I'm the second David. Which means that David 1 must have been recycled at some point.

#### TREXEL

Ahh. Sharp as a tack as ever. Now, David, um... you are being recycled today! [__DAVID 2:__ Yes.] And I really, I just-- I just really need to needle down as to why. Because, well-- this is my running theory: it is *your* fault. Because __[laughs]__ I don't know if you know this, David, but I am-- I am *excellent* at my job. I'm better than any person who has been good at anything in all of recorded time and history and space. So, the *only* explanation, David, the *only* explanation... is there is something wrong with this clone batch, because __[laughs]__ I just as I say, this *can't* be my fault. __[unsure]__ Apart from... the fact that it's happened all these-- no, no, it can't-- it *cannot* be my fault.

#### DAVID 2

I'm sorry, Trexel, but that's largely impossible. All clones are produced to Stellar Firma guidelines, which as you know, have been designed over thousands of years to be nigh-on perfect. If there were any problems, it would be picked up by one of the managerial staff, and that clone would be recycled before being given to a consultant. So, I am very sorry, Trexel, but your argument does not actually make any sense.

#### TREXEL

Okay, that sounds, uh-- a lot like you're *questioning* me, David, and as you know, clones and questioning don't... really mix. However, I--

#### DAVID 2

I'm sorry, Trexel, it sounds like you do not have all the information. If I can merely quote some statistics--

#### TREXEL

No, no, no, nope, no, no, I-- I--

#### DAVID 2 [over Trexel's protests]

It seems a normal consultant has a clone burn rate of about one in every eight years. [__TREXEL:__ I don't think we need to go into this--] And usually, that is only to upgrade them. Now, I know I am not ready for an upgrade, and I was David 2, which means that David 1 was prematurely recycled.

#### TREXEL

Well, okay, this is a supposition. Erm, and, I think you'll find that you can...Interview terminated.

##### [electronic powering-down sound]

##### [activation beep]

#### MALE ROBOT VOICE

David 3.

##### [electronic activation sound]

#### TREXEL [agitated]

Okay, lock the doors. Lock the doors! Shut it down! Nobody gets out! I know it's only you and me here, __[growling]__ *David 3,* but there is something afoot. And you know what?! I think there's something *ahoof!* There's a *conspiracy* here! I am being *needled*, I am being *got at*, and I think I know what's going on... Who do you work for, David 3?

#### DAVID 3

Stellar Firma Ltd.

#### TREXEL

I'm going to ask you this again, David. *Who. Do you work for?*

#### DAVID 3

...Stellar Firma Ltd. Or, more specifically, uh, Trexel Geistman, an *employee* of Stellar Firma Ltd.

#### TREXEL

You're... a *liar!* I can see it in your eyes! Clouds of ineptitude swirling! Swirling in the orbs of *lies*!

#### DAVID 3

I'm sorry, Trexel, clones can't lie, we're not programmed to.

#### TREXEL

You can't lie?

#### DAVID 3

Not according to our programming.

#### TREXEL

Under *any* circumstances?

#### DAVID 3

...No.

#### TREXEL

Then tell me why I'm *failing*.

#### DAVID 3

I... __[halting]__ I-- I-- I'm sorry, Trexel, we're also programmed not to... directly... criticize the... consultant... so... I c-can't... t-tell. The order... is... no... can't.

#### TREXEL [whispered]

Interview terminated.
