#### IMOGEN

Rusty Quill presents: Stellar Firma.

##### [theme continues]

#### DAVID 

_(talking to self)_ Why is his blood so *sticky*? It just won't... __[sighs, squelchy sounds]__ We're about 20 minutes away. He's late as usual... Oh, I hope he thinks he caught Mirror Trexel, calms him down a bit. __[footsteps approach] [sighing]__ Oh, all right...

##### [door swooshes open]

#### TREXEL

David!

#### DAVID

Ah!

#### TREXEL

David!

#### DAVID

Trexel.

#### TREXEL

Hello.

#### DAVID

Hello...

#### TREXEL

How are you?

#### DAVID

Very well, thank you.

#### TREXEL

I'm well--

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

--also.

#### DAVID

Did you catch the perpetrator who smashed you with a mirror?

#### TREXEL

No, slipped away. Slipped away from my grabbing fingers once again, but not to worry--

#### DAVID

Right, yes, then. Nice bandage you've got on your hand.

#### TREXEL

Thank you, I did it myself! Didn't want to go to Sick Bay. They won't see me anymore, but I--

#### DAVID

Yes. It... looks... bad.

#### TREXEL

It's pretty bad, David, pretty bad. Bit of a laceration on the hand there, but I'll find Mirror Trexel one day, and I'll teach him a lesson or two about what *real Trexel* can do!

#### DAVID

Okay!

#### TREXEL

But that's not important David.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

_(deceptively normal)_ I think what's important is that everything is fine!

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

And this is a regular day.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

And we're going to design a planet...

#### DAVID

Yes?

#### TREXEL

We're gonna have a lovely time, David...

#### DAVID 

_(uncertainly)_ Yes...?

#### TREXEL

And everyone's going to enjoy themselves... [__DAVID:__ Yes.] ...and at the end of it, _(threatening)_ *everybody's going to be* *fine*.

#### DAVID

...Okay.

#### TREXEL

So, why don't you grab the brief, David? Why don't you grab the brief then?

#### DAVID

Right, so...

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ Initiating.

#### DAVID

The brief is from... Sandan Trexi--

#### TREXEL 

_(shouting)_ Stop right there!

#### DAVID

Uhh...

#### TREXEL

Surprise for you!

#### DAVID

What?

#### TREXEL

Come in, Harry!

##### [door swooshes open]

#### HARRY

Hiya.

#### DAVID

Who?

#### TREXEL

This... is Harry.

#### HARRY

You alright?

#### TREXEL

He's a technician from maintenance!

#### HARRY

Yeah.

#### TREXEL

And a good friend of mine from the Cosmic Lounge.

#### HARRY

*Met*. Met. We've met a few times...

#### TREXEL

We've met a lot of times, Harry! We're *friends*! We're *friends*!

#### HARRY 

_(noncommittal)_ Mmm.

#### TREXEL

You're my *friend!*

#### HARRY

Yep, okay, we'll round it up to friends.

#### TREXEL

We're friends. [__DAVID:__ Right.] And he is going to help me in my little investigation of this little __[David sighs tiredly]__ web of lies that you have, [__DAVID:__ Really?] you big fat lie spider!

#### DAVID

Right. Okay.

#### HARRY

I'm just gonna have a look at some stuff.

#### TREXEL

He's gonna have a look at some stuff. [__HARRY:__ Just look at some--] Just make sure everything's in order! Make sure everything's in order.

#### DAVID

Like-- like the planet? And help us design it... well? In the next twenty minutes?

#### TREXEL

Sure! Sure, we still need to design a planet. Yes, that's what we're doing. That's what we're focused on, not on picking apart your _(yelling)_ *web of lies!*

#### DAVID

...*Okay.* So?

#### HARRY

Yeah.

#### DAVID

So... Sandan Trexiko?

#### TREXEL

Mm-hmm.

#### DAVID

Um, they want... they want the planet built to show up their coworker who got a moon last quarter.

#### TREXEL

Right.

#### DAVID

And, um, the one non-negotiable feature is, uh, lakes of fire.

#### TREXEL

Wonderful. That's great. [__DAVID:__ So...] Such a regular, normal brief and we're going to write things down... [__DAVID:__ Yep.] on your notes! Grab them, Harry! Grab the notes! Get them! Get them!

##### [sounds of struggle, rustling papers]

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ No-- Wha-- No-- No! Leave it!

#### HARRY

_(crosstalk)_ Wha-- Sorry, just... give me the-- the notes.

#### TREXEL

Now...

#### HARRY

I'm sorry about this, man. It's just such--

#### TREXEL

Don't apologise to the accused!

#### HARRY

It's sometimes best just to humour him, just to...

#### DAVID 

_(agreeing)_ Oh-- yeah, oh, no, I know. Don't you--

#### TREXEL

Harry! You're on *my* side!

#### HARRY

Okay.

#### TREXEL

Now, look at the-- look at the notes there. Look at the notes.

#### HARRY

Yeah.

#### TREXEL

Is there anything hidden in there? Perhaps a secret code, perhaps nanobots inside the paper that take the words and twist them into lies?!

#### HARRY

I'll have a look, okay? I'll have a look. I'm just gonna tear it--

#### DAVID

You think nanobots are rewriting my notes in real time?

#### TREXEL 

_(manic)_ I don't know, David! I don't know anymore!

#### HARRY

It happens.

#### DAVID

Does it?

#### HARRY

Yeah. You wouldn't believe the amount of nanobots get in paper.

#### TREXEL

Everywhere!

#### HARRY

Just they've got-- the thing is, they've got like a real telltale kind of droppings. I'm just gonna open up the paper, give it a wee tear...

##### [paper tears]

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ Employees will be charged for... destruction of stationary.

#### HARRY

I'm looking at the fibres...

#### TREXEL 

_(whispering)_ Fibres of lies... fibres of lies...

#### HARRY

Nope. No nanobot evidence.

#### TREXEL

Oh.

#### HARRY

Usually, they've got a particular dropping, but I can't... I don't see any...

#### TREXEL

No, I see.

#### DAVID

So the notes are fine.

#### TREXEL

Notes are fine? Regular paper? Nothing, nothing untoward there, Harry?! Nothing that-- that means that we can flush him out of airlock?

#### HARRY

No--

#### DAVID

What? What?!

#### TREXEL

Sorry! Sorry. I'm gonna calm down.

#### HARRY

C-can I g-go now?

#### TREXEL

No, Harry! You will stay here and you will help me until we have got to the bottom of this barrel of untruth!

#### DAVID

So, like, getting to the bottom of this planet, right?

#### TREXEL

Sure! Fine!

#### DAVID

For Sandan?

#### TREXEL

Yes! why not?

#### DAVID

Okay.Brilliant. So we don't really know anything about their coworker or them, so...

#### TREXEL

Yes. Let's look him up, David! [__DAVID:__ O--] Let's look him up on IMOGEN, as you like to look up things on IMOGEN so damn much!

#### DAVID

'Cause it's helpful with the brief?

#### TREXEL 

_(sarcastic)_ Oh, is it helpful?

#### DAVID

Information? Yes? Yes? Yes?

#### TREXEL

Oh, yes, yes. Everything's so helpful for David 7, whilst Trexel sits in the corner without a single ally! I thought Harry was here on my side, but he's so far been a little bit wavery!

#### HARRY

I'm just helping you out, man, alright?

#### TREXEL

Fine! Fine!

#### HARRY

Just... I'll do it, okay?

#### TREXEL

Fine!

#### DAVID

He's doing-- he's doing you a favour, Trexel.

#### TREXEL

Okay, fine! Don't... fraternise! Now, look up Sandan Trexiko.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ IMOGEN online. Client fact file: Sandan Trexiko.

#### DAVID

Sandan Trexiko... looks like they're a galactic bureaucrat.

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### DAVID

They like reading and watching holovids... ooh, and, um... there's not-- not much-- not much else there.

#### TREXEL

Reading and watching holovids?

#### DAVID

Yeah. All of their assessments are very... average.

#### TREXEL

So they're tedious personality vacuum. We should have suspected this of a galactic bureaucrat! The galactic government, which Stellar Firma will have nothing to do with, are a bunch of bores! "Oh, do this! Don't do that! Don't dump your waste there, that's a planet!" They're always giving us a hard time, and it's because they're full of a bunch of boring nincompoops.

#### HARRY

Wait a second. *I* like to watch holovids and... and read.

#### TREXEL

Tell me, Harry, do you also like travel?

#### HARRY

Ehhh... when I can.

#### TREXEL

Do you also like spending time with friends?

#### HARRY

Yes!

#### TREXEL

Do you-- do you, perhaps, like keeping up on current events, Harry? Is that-- is that an interest of yours, that you might write down and show to someone?

#### HARRY

Yes! On my-- my profile.

#### TREXEL

David, this is amazing. [__DAVID:__ Right.] What we've got here in Harry is a perfect simulacrum of a tedious bureaucrat!

#### HARRY 

_(offended)_ Excuse me! I'm doing you a favour!

#### TREXEL

Their interests so shallow, their personality more thin than a gossamer thread!

#### DAVID

I-I'm sorry about this, Harry.

#### HARRY

No, it's fine.

#### TREXEL

So all we need to do is design something that Harry will like and think would show up their coworker, and Bob's your uncle, we've got a planet that this person will love!

#### DAVID

Okay. Right. Fine. Insults aside... Harry?

#### HARRY

Yes?

#### DAVID

Given that you're like Sandan, and all galactic bureaucrats are the same...

#### TREXEL

Pretty much!

#### DAVID

And Sandan's coworker is a galac-- galactic bureaucrat?

#### TREXEL

Stamped out of a cookie cutter of an industry, they are!

#### HARRY

Again, I would like to point out, that I am here doing you people a favour--

#### DAVID

Look, you're not doing me a favour, and I'm just following the logical progression that Trexel has set up.

#### TREXEL

You're on my side, Harry!

#### HARRY

Can't fault the logic.

#### DAVID

Okay. So if you were gonna have a moon--

#### HARRY

Yep.

#### DAVID

--what would you have on it?

#### TREXEL

Mm.

#### HARRY

A moon. If I had a moon, Harry's moon... oh man, I'd cut out the craters for starters.

#### TREXEL

You'd cut them out?

#### HARRY

Yeah, cut them out.

#### TREXEL

What, just make it a big, smooth, smooth ball?

#### HARRY

Oh, no, I'd invert the craters. Inverted craters!

#### TREXEL

You mean mountains?

#### HARRY

Yeah, mountains!

#### TREXEL

Okay!

#### DAVID

Okay, what-- what would you have on the mountains? Would you have anything?

#### TREXEL

Just anything interesting, Harry?

#### HARRY

Yeah... yeah! I'd have, uh... I'd have a-- a place to meet friends, and read, and...

#### TREXEL

Right.

#### HARRY

...watch holovids...

#### TREXEL

Right, okay, so you want a living room.

#### HARRY

I want a--

#### TREXEL

You want a-- you want a living room on a mountain on a moon. Is *that* what you want, Harry?

#### HARRY

Yes!

#### TREXEL

Great, okay--

#### HARRY

What-- Sorry, what is wrong with that? What is wrong with watching holovids--

#### TREXEL

It's so tedious! You've got a *moon*, Harry! You could do anything you want with it! You could--

#### DAVID

Well, what would you do then, Trexel?

#### HARRY

Well-- yeah, what would *you* do with a moon?

#### TREXEL

I would make it the most sumptuous pleasure moon that anyone has ever seen.

#### HARRY

Right.

#### TREXEL

There would be both caverns, canyons, and mountains!

#### HARRY

Okay, and what would you do in the caverns, the canyons, and the mountains? See your friends and drink?

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ Oh, you know, you'd sort of meet friends and drink-- Oh, *no*, you've got me there! You would meet-- maybe everything is just, you know, meeting up with friends... drinking... watching holovids... _(out of breath)_ talking about travel...

#### DAVID

Oh no, Trexel--

#### TREXEL

Oh no!

#### DAVID

No, nope, stop-- stop-- stop-- No, quit--

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ We're all just hollow reflections of each other!

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ Warning: consultant spiraling.

#### TREXEL

Every person is the same person!

#### DAVID

Okay--

#### TREXEL

_(panicked shouting)_ I am nothing! I am not unique!

#### DAVID

IMOGEN, get the spritzer! IMOGEN! Get the spritzer!

#### TREXEL

*I am not--*

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ Deploying no-no spray.

##### [spritzing noises]

#### TREXEL 

Ah! I'm being spritzed! Augh! Ough...

#### HARRY

No, it's okay, man! __[sound of spray retracting]__ It's okay just to have simple pleasures. You just gotta... make of it.

#### TREXEL

I want complex pleasures that impress people and make them think I'm impressive!

#### DAVID

I'd like *any* pleasures.

#### HARRY

Well, that's not true, is it? It's not real. That's just, like... just putting it on. All right, you just gotta take-- you watch a holovid and that's real satisfying. You see your friends, that's, like, a good day.

#### TREXEL

Harry, you're so wise. So what you're saying--

#### DAVID

I wish I had a friend like you.

#### TREXEL

Yes, it would be good if you had *a* friend. __[David sighs]__ What we need to do... The best revenge is living well. So this planet, in order to show up this hollow, tedious moon, just needs to be a place of simple reflection and personal wellness. And by being that personally well and reflective nearby another person's show-off moon will defeat that moon by its very nature.

#### DAVID

_(sarcastic)_ Right.

#### TREXEL

You'll look across it and think, "Ah, I've got a shiny fancy moon in this corner, but look at that planet. That person's really got their stuff worked out. *God,* I'm a pile of garbage." And then you've won. And then you've won.

#### DAVID

Okay, so there's no places for reading or meeting friends.

#### TREXEL

No, no, let's cut them out. It's all about spiritual wellness, oneness, calmness, both professional and personal growth.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

And I think the best way to do that is to-- Harry! Grab his chair!

#### DAVID

What?! No--

##### [sounds of chair scuffle, David cries out]

#### TREXEL

Grab his chair, Harry!

#### HARRY

Sorry.

#### TREXEL

Grab his chair!

#### HARRY

The chair.

#### TREXEL

Now, this chair has been bothering me for a while. It! Is! Full! Of subterfuge, Harry! Analyse the chair!

#### HARRY

Okay, I mean, it's full of some things. The hole in the bottom here...

#### TREXEL

Yes. Yes! The hole, that's where he keeps the lies! I'm gonna put my hand in the hole and grab out the lies, Harry! Argh! Whoa... __[sizzling sounds, pained screaming]__ Whoa. Whoa, It burns! *It burns!* His effluent *burns!* It was full of his effluent and chemicals! Ahh!

#### DAVID

What'd you expect?!

#### TREXEL

I don't know, I thought it was gonna be full of-- I don't know, secret notes! Or, or, I don't know! I don't know! But, it-- it-- Oh... my hand... my hand is...

#### HARRY

Seems to be... semi-dissolved.

#### TREXEL

It's semi-dissolved!

#### DAVID 

_(flatly)_ Oh dear.

#### HARRY

Uh...

#### DAVID

_(from the floor)_ Can I get back on my chair now?

#### TREXEL

Yes, sorry, get back on his chair. Let him back in his chair. The chair is clean. What were we doing?

#### DAVID 

_(losing his patience)_ We were designing a planet, Trexel!

#### TREXEL

Oh, of course, yes! Let's design the planet. Now--

#### DAVID

So, you want somewhere for spiritual wellness and oneness, nowhere to read, nowhere to meet friends, so a planet of deep and respectful solitude and introspection, right?

#### TREXEL

Now, you've forgotten something incredibly important, David.

#### DAVID

Is it the lake of fire?

#### TREXEL

It's the lake of fire! How do we have a lake of fire on a planet that's otherwise supposed to be for calmness and spiritual reflection? Fire isn't calm or spiritual, it just ruins things!

#### DAVID

But it is one of the core elements of being.

#### TREXEL 

__[gasps]__ Fire, earth, water, air! All four!

#### DAVID

And-- and goo.

#### TREXEL

And goo.

#### DAVID

Goo. We're quite--

#### TREXEL

Are we-- are we having goo as-- as one of the--

#### DAVID

Well, clone goo. Clones are made from goo. I am, you know, a-- clone goo.

#### TREXEL

Ohh, I didn't want to tell you this this way, David, but, um, no one *cares* about what clones want.

#### DAVID

Oh? _(disappointed)_ Ohh. Well, actually, I'd-- I'd-- I'd-- I'd-- I'd pretty much gathered that anyway. But, um...

#### TREXEL

Sorry.

#### DAVID

No, fine, four. Four elements.

#### TREXEL

Oh, he looks so sad Harry, doesn't he?

#### HARRY

Very sad. I mean...

#### TREXEL

Could we include goo, just to--

#### HARRY

So we want a lake of all of these things, do we?

#### TREXEL

Okay, okay, so we've got a lake of fire, a lake of water, a lake of *air*, a lake of *goo*, and a freshly tilled lake of earth. And as you wander past all these things, it allows you to become a spiritually whole person and really *stick it to your coworkers* in the process!

#### DAVID

Yes, well-- and also you-- I mean, I-- I guess your coworker would have to know that it's *your* planet*.*

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

So maybe we have these lakes and we have sort of a nexus point at the middle of them, where you sit and meditate on how much better you are than everyone else because you have interests that are spiritual and not physical, [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] and material things are pointless, like reading and meeting friends.

#### TREXEL

Exactly.

#### HARRY

Excuse me...

#### DAVID

And, also, they need to know that it's Sandan Trexico's planet, so that when they look from their moon they see... Sandan Trexico, so...

#### TREXEL

So the lakes all spell out your name!

#### DAVID

I was thinking like a giant magnifying glass so you look at the... the Sandan Trexico and you'd see them sitting there, with a big head.

#### TREXEL

Ooh, I like that! And also, the giant magnifying glass will take care of the lake of fire if ever it goes out, 'cause you just angle that towards the sun, suddenly, your lake of air? Now it's a lake of fire!

#### DAVID

Good job, Trexel, you've identified a terrible thing about this giant magnifying glass.

#### TREXEL

No, I want to keep that! I want the big magnifying glass!

#### DAVID

But what if it burns up Sandan Trexico?

#### TREXEL

Well then, you know what? C'est la vie.

#### DAVID

I-I guess that is a very--

#### TREXEL

'Cause you know what? Whatever will be will be.

#### DAVID

Yep, I--

#### TREXEL

Because you know what? At the end of the day, everything is one.

#### DAVID

Yep, no, I--

#### TREXEL

Because you know what? Really, when it comes down to it? Everything is dust.

#### DAVID

Okay, yeah, no, so--

#### TREXEL

We are dust.

#### HARRY

Oh, or, uh, air. Or goo.

#### TREXEL

Or air. Or fire. Or we're goo.

#### DAVID

Or earth. I'm goo.

#### TREXEL

Yes, you're goo. I'm more of a fire. What are you? A water-type?

#### HARRY

Uhh... wind.

#### TREXEL

You're wind-type! Oh, okay, well, I'm-- I'm fire-type, you're wind-type, and you're goo-type.

#### DAVID

I'm goo! Goo.

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ I'm IMOGEN-type.

#### TREXEL

Wonderful. Wonderful!

#### HARRY

Which one beats which one? Is this like that collecting game?

#### TREXEL

I think-- Yes, I think fire-type beats goo-type--

#### DAVID

Well...

#### TREXEL

--but goo-type beats wind-type. Because if you throw goo into the air, the air gets all gooey.

#### DAVID

I mean, w--

#### HARRY

The wind can blow goo away with its wind--

#### DAVID

I mean, honestly, reading the room more, I think, like... goo and wind are kind of getting on quite well, and fire's sort of burning out in the corner.

#### HARRY

But--

#### TREXEL

I think fire-type destroys wind-type and goo-type, because wind-type and goo-type need to be put in their place!

#### HARRY

But the wind-type could blow the goo-type out of the fire. We should put the fire out.

#### DAVID

Yeah.

#### TREXEL

So what you're saying is goo-type beats fire-type, but fire-type beats wind, because *fire* burns *gas*! So I'll burn all your gas up, you big windy gas boy!

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ IMOGEN-type beats *everyone*.

#### HARRY

But you need me to survive.

#### TREXEL

It's true. I need-- I need fuel. I need an ignition source, and I also need oxygen to burn. Gah, I'm so dependent on everybody!

#### DAVID

Yeah, you are quite needy.

#### TREXEL

_(yelling)_ What is fire without air?!

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ Warning: consultant spiraling.

#### TREXEL

_(yelling)_ What is fire without friends, reading, and travel?!

#### HARRY

See?

#### TREXEL 

_(whispered)_ We are dust.

#### DAVID

Okay, well, I'm-- I mean, I'm-- I'm goo. Like, powdered goo, but... Right, so, are we-- are we good? Are we-- we've done the planet? We got water-- We've covered everything?

#### TREXEL

The planet seems good, David, and you'd think that means that we were done. But wait, what's that in the horizon?

#### DAVID

Uh, a brief submission.

#### TREXEL

Is it-- is it a truck following you down an empty highway, ready to drive you off a cliff? Is it perhaps a shark swimming towards your increasingly crumbling piece of wood from a shipwreck? [__DAVID:__ I don't-- I don't--] No, it's my suspicious pointing finger of accusation! Harry... check the tubes!

#### DAVID

What?

#### HARRY

Sorry...

#### TREXEL

Check the tubes, Harry!

#### HARRY

This one?

#### TREXEL

The tubes he used last time to slither and spray, because they are full of lies and they are on *his* side!

#### DAVID

It's just a tube of clone slurry!

#### HARRY

It's a standard slurry tube.

#### TREXEL

It's not! It *has* to be the tubes! That's all that's left! Look at--

#### HARRY 

_(exasperated)_ *Look!* Look at it, Trexel!

#### TREXEL

I'm looking in the tubes.

#### HARRY

Okay.

#### TREXEL

There's nothing here. Turn it on, Harry! Turn it on!

#### HARRY

It's horrible stuff!

#### TREXEL

Turn it on, Harry, I need to see!

#### HARRY

_(crosstalk)_ It's not fit for consumption by life! Okay...

#### TREXEL

I need to see!

##### [clone tube turns on, horrible slurry sounds]

#### TREXEL 

_(pained screeching)_ Ahh, my eyes!

#### HARRY

You did that to yourself, man! You did that to yourself--

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ My eyes! My eyes! __[sobs]__

#### DAVID

He spends a lot of time covered in clone slurry.

#### TREXEL 

_(distraught)_ Oh, it's all *fine!*

#### HARRY

It's like he wanted that.

#### DAVID

Mmm.

#### TREXEL

It's all regular and fine!

#### DAVID

Yes!

#### TREXEL

I was convinced that there had to be something!

#### HARRY

Come on man.

#### DAVID

No!

#### TREXEL

*Something!*

#### DAVID

No!

#### HARRY

Trexel, come on... I don't like it when you're in this kind of pit. It's not good.

#### DAVID

You've-- you've wasted my time, you've wasted Harry's time...

#### HARRY

Yeah.

#### DAVID

You've wasted Sandan Trexico's time...

#### TREXEL

Wasted everyone's time with my wild accusations. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everybody--

#### HARRY

Come on, let's-- let's just do this-- Should we sing the song that gets you into the happy place?

#### TREXEL

Let's sing the happy drinking song [__DAVID:__ Uhh.] from the happy place.

#### HARRY

Yay.

#### DAVID

Um, what?

#### TREXEL

Two, three, four!

#### DAVID

No no no no!

There's been a clunking noise every time!

You try to hide it from me, but the clunking is there!

Is there something wrong?

No, stop-- No, don't-- No, no--

Oh yeah... looks like a bit-- looks like a bit can come off.

This is my work, and it's stuck in the tube! Why is it stuck in the tube, David?

#### DAVID

No idea!

#### TREXEL

Oh, just been there's a problem with the tube?

#### DAVID

Faulty tube?

#### TREXEL 

_(screaming)_ I do think someone [__DAVID:__ Faulty--] has tampered with the room and is changing *my work*!

#### DAVID

_(feigning innocence)_ No.

#### TREXEL

Harry, reset the room.
