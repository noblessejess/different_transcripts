Hi, uh, D-David here. Uh, 7. David 7. Um, I've got a... I-I've got a song, uh, that I’d— I'd, um, I'd quite like to... to sing. Um... So, uh— Oh! Uh, I-IMOGEN, could you... could you give me some of the... the wibbly-wobblies? Y'know, on my voice.

♪ When it’s dark at night

and I close my eyes,

I can see you there, 

only one that doesn’t hate me.  



<br><br>I think I dreamed it all, 

got your drawing on my wall,

I just feel so calm 

held by your arms.  



<br><br>Why are you so far away in Galactonium?  



<br><br>Hey, won’t you save me? Hold me? Maybe?  

I just  want to be your little clone baby  



<br><br>Little clone baby

Little clone baby

Little clone baby

I just wanna be



<br><br>Little clone baby

Little clone baby

Little clone baby

I just wanna be



<br><br>Little clone baby

Little clone baby

I just wanna be



<br><br>Little clone baby

Little clone baby

Little clone baby

I just wanna be



<br><br>The days are hard, the nights are worse,

so far from you across the universe.

But I can see your hand in mine,

It’s all just a matter of time.



<br><br>A matter of time



<br><br>At night I cry,

in the day I’m strong,

Just trying to survive,

Just need to be calm.



<br><br>I can live

with this space above

if you just give

a piece of your love.



<br><br>You’re not so far away in Galactonium.



<br><br>Hey, won’t you save me? Hold me? Maybe?  

I just  want to be your little clone baby



<br><br>Little clone baby

Little clone baby

Little clone baby

I just wanna be



<br><br>Little clone baby

Little clone baby

Little clone baby

I just wanna be



<br><br>Little clone baby

Little clone baby

Little clone baby

I just wanna be



<br><br>Little clone baby

Little clone baby

Little clone baby

I just wanna be ♫
