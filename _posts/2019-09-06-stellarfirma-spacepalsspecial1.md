##### [Rusty Quill Gaming podcast theme]

#### HELEN

Hello, and welcome to the Rusty Quill Gaming Podcast with me, Helen Gould, instead of Alexander Newall.

##### [Lydia laughs]

#### BEN

He's dead!

#### HELEN

__[laughs]__ We got rid of him in a coup.

#### LYDIA

*(laughing)* The king is dead!

#### HELEN

__[chuckles]__ Long live *me*.

##### [Lydia laughs]

#### HELEN

So. I will not be your GM today because today we are playing a GM-less game.

#### LYDIA

Wooo.

#### HELEN

And I am actually getting rid of, like, half the rules. But!

##### [scattered laughter]

#### HELEN

With--

#### LYDIA

Anarchy wins!

#### HELEN

Yes! With me on this adventure, I have:

#### BEN

Ben Meredith.

#### ALEX

I'm here and doing what I'm told apparently.

#### HELEN

Yes, you are.

##### [Alex laughs]

#### BEN

What's your name!

#### TIM

*(simult.)* What's your name?

#### LYDIA

*(simult.)* What's your name--TELL US YOUR NAME!

#### ALEX

*(simult.)* Alex! Newall! I'm sorry!

##### [Helen laughs]

#### LYDIA

Tell us it again!

#### ALEX

I'm sorry, I'm Alex Newall.

#### LYDIA

Yeah, good.

#### ALEX

Do what I'm told.

#### LYDIA

I'm Lydia Nicholas.

#### TIM

And I'm Tim Meredith.

#### HELEN

Now, Tim, you are new to the gaming podcast.

#### ALEX

Stranger! __[screeches like an attacking bird]__

##### [Helen laughs]

#### TIM

I'm just a little baby boy.

#### LYDIA

Gosh, no! Are *you* editing it? 'Cause that is cruelty!

##### [laughter]

#### HELEN

Tim, please tell us about who you are and what you're doing here.

#### TIM

Well first and, I suppose, chronologically foremost, I'm Ben's brother.

#### BEN

Hello.

#### TIM

Uh, that happened first.

#### ALEX

Boo!

##### [Lydia and Helen laugh]

#### TIM

And we have together started another podcast on this delightful network of Rusty Quill, called--

#### BEN

*(amused)* You've probably never heard of it.

#### TIM

You've probably never heard of it. It probably hasn't come up in your feed or adverts or nothing.

#### ALEX

*(simult.)* MENTION ITS NAME! I'm getting a *twitch!*

#### TIM

*(simult.)* Mention--well it's called--uh, what's it called?

#### BEN

Um...

#### TIM

Um, uh--oh, um--__[snapping fingers impatiently]__--Stellar Firma, is its name.

##### [Lydia chuckles]

#### TIM

Stellar Firma.

##### [Helen chuckles]

##### [Alex sighs]

#### TIM

*(advert* *announcer* *voice)* An improvised sci-fi comedy podcast. Available now.

#### ALEX

Better. I like it.

#### BEN

*(sillier announcer voice)* From podcasts apps around the internet!

#### TIM

*(advert announcer voice)* Excuse me if I just crawl into your ear for one mere moment to tell you about Stellar Firma.

##### [Alex snorts]

#### TIM

__[dramatic inhale]__ *(huskily)* Hello.

##### [laughter]

#### TIM

Okay, I'm done.

##### [Alex bursts out laughing]

#### HELEN

Okay. Great. Got a hello there. That's all we need.

##### [Lydia and Ben laughing]

#### ALEX

Whoa, Helen's relying on the editing hard here!

#### LYDIA

Yeahhhh.

#### TIM

At the end of every bit I'll just go, "I'm done."

##### [laughter]

#### TIM

*(dramatic)* "But you *can't* *go* *in* *there!*" *(softly)* I'm done.

#### HELEN

Okay. All right. Is that everything that you wanted to say?

#### TIM

*(softly)* I'm done.

#### HELEN

Okay!

##### [Lydia laughs]

#### HELEN

All right! So. What we are playing today is called Vast & Starlit and it is by Epidiah Ravachol. I apologise in advance if that is pronounced incorrectly. That is just--that's my fault. So. How to explain it? We are escaped convicts. We have gotten off a prison ship and commandeered... a... weird--I was going to say boat but I'm just going to say starship instead.

##### [laughter]

#### ALEX

Star boat.

#### BEN

Space boat!

#### LYDIA

*(simult.)* Space boat.

#### TIM

*(simult.)* Space boat.

#### ALEX

Oh, space boat's better.

#### HELEN

Yes. We have commandeered...

##### [Tim chuckling]

#### HELEN

...a space boat.

#### LYDIA

*(laughing)* Yeah!

#### ALEX

Yep.

#### HELEN

And are on our way to...

##### [Tim and Lydia laughing quietly]

#### HELEN

...freedom, essentially. Usually the story that is given in advance of this is that our prison ship encountered the strange space boat--

##### [Lydia laughs]

#### TIM

*(simult,* *deadpan)* My god. A space boat.

#### HELEN

*(simult.)* --and sent us on there in case it killed us. But like, just to investigate. And then the--we either--

#### ALEX

Oh, like a Suicide Squad style kind of...

#### HELEN

Yes!

#### ALEX

Okay.

#### HELEN

So, we either hijacked the space boat or it left without us doing anything, or it disappeared and now we're somewhere else. We can decide as we go along.

#### LYDIA

*(simult.)* Right, okay.

#### ALEX

*(simult.)* Okay.

#### HELEN

So, this is sort of less of a game and more of sort of a... series of improvised scenes which get more and more... tense.

##### [Alex chuckles; Helen laughs]

#### BEN

So, welcome to the Rusty Quill Series of Improvised Scenes Podcast.

#### HELEN

Yes!

#### LYDIA

Just gonna chill... in our space boat.

#### HELEN

Yes.

#### ALEX

But getting steadily more tense whilst we chill.

#### TIM

Yeah.

#### LYDIA

Tension! Tension!

#### VARIOUS

*(chanting)* Tension! Tension! Tension! Tension! Tension! Tension! Tension!

##### [Tim imitates a train whistle]

#### BEN

Ohh, I'm so tense now.

#### LYDIA

Wooo!

#### HELEN

Now.

#### LYDIA

*(simult.)* I am difficult!

#### HELEN

*(simult.)* There are no dice in this system.

##### [Ben chuckles]

#### HELEN

There are no cards. There's not even like a coin to flip. Basically, we have to decide on how everything happens amongst ourselves. It's a narrative driven game that is the kind of game that I mostly play, 'cause I'm much more along the lines of a Grant Howitt gamer than an Alex Newall gamer.

#### ALEX

Rules are fun!

#### HELEN

*(simult.)* No, they're not.

#### ALEX

*(simult.)* The game is... kind of beside the point.

#### HELEN

I'm hosting today!

##### [Lydia chuckles]

#### HELEN

*(simult.)* *My* way goes.

#### TIM

*(simult.)* No rules here.

#### LYDIA

*Back* *in* *the* *hole!*

#### BEN

Helen--

#### HELEN

Now--

#### BEN

--I have to say that I'm very glad that our faction has taken over the podcast.

#### HELEN

__[laughs]__ It is a *better* way.

#### TIM

I look forward to the terror and guillotinings of the--

#### ALEX

*(simult.)* Tim! Join me and--

#### TIM

*(simult.)* --sure-to-follow new regime.

#### ALEX

*(simult.)* --together we will *rule* with... *subsystems!*

#### BEN

*(simult.)* Well, see--it's only Bryn and Alex.

##### [Tim chuckling]

#### BEN

It's only Bryn and Alex and Bryn's not here, so Alex is completely outnumbered.

#### TIM

Trapped.

#### HELEN

*(simult.)* Yes, he is.

#### TIM

*(simult.)* Alone. Isolated!

#### LYDIA

Now, I don't dislike rules, I just--

#### TIM

Traitor! Kill her.

#### LYDIA

--plough through them.

##### [Helen laughs]

#### LYDIA

In naive--

#### BEN

Oh, yeah, it's not that you don't like them, you just ignore them.

#### LYDIA

I just--yeah!

#### HELEN

I mean, I do tell a lie. There is some character creation before we get to the actual game play.

#### BEN

A RULE?

#### LYDIA

What?!

#### HELEN

I *know!* I'm terrible.

##### [Lydia makes an upset banshee noise]

#### ALEX

And so it begins!

#### HELEN

Now, we have got some rudimentary stuff to get through. So... Tim, can you briefly introduce your character first?

#### TIM

My character's name is Deraldio Pilchards. He's a member of the hybunk race. They are described as squat, square, and cross.

##### [laugh]

#### TIM

And my crime that ended in my incarceration on this prison space boat is that I was digging trap pits for banditry reasons. And I was--

##### [Alex snorts]

#### HELEN

Oh.

#### LYDIA

Oh, no.

#### TIM

--was digging trap pits and they were like, "What are they for?" And I was like, "Uh, banditry reasons." And so--

##### [laughter]

#### TIM

And they... hauled me away.

#### ALEX

And then you said, "I'm done."

#### TIM

And I'm done.

##### [laughter]

#### TIM

I'm done.

#### HELEN

All right.

##### [Alex laughs]

#### HELEN

Lydia, what's your character's name, species, and crime?

#### LYDIA

My name is Mr. Squeakington, but I am female. The reason that there is this mix-up is that I'm a budgie, and they're quite hard to tell apart. Budgie, brackets "interdimensional".

##### [laughter]

#### TIM

Space budgie!

#### LYDIA

*(laughing)* My crime... was smuggling budgies.

##### [Tim laughs]

#### BEN

Does it--wait--s--

#### LYDIA

Budgie smuggling! __[laughs]__

##### [Alex laughs]

#### LYDIA

*(simult.)* Budgies are being--

#### BEN

*(simult.)* Is that--is that for you--is that people trafficking for you?

#### LYDIA

Yes!

##### [Tim laughing]

#### LYDIA

People--Budgies were being kept--

#### ALEX

Dark.

#### LYDIA

--against their will.

#### ALEX

Dark.

#### TIM

*(laughing)* So much worse than I was--

#### LYDIA

I was sneaking the budgies to a better place.

#### BEN

So I backed off of war crimes, but--

#### LYDIA

*(laughing)* But I--

##### [Helen laughs]

#### LYDIA

*No!* *I'm**...*

#### BEN

*Oh--*

#### LYDIA

*(simult.)* ...saving the budgies!

#### BEN

*(simult.)* --but you were more of a--oh, okay.

#### LYDIA

*(simult.)* Save the budgies.

#### TIM

*(simult.)* It was an Underground Railroad sort of situation.

#### BEN

*(simult.)* Yeah, okay.

#### LYDIA

Yeah! Underground but budgies and interdimensional.

#### HELEN

Okay. And just to clarify, you're a talking budgie.

#### LYDIA

I'm a talking budgie.

#### HELEN

Fantastic.

#### LYDIA

But when I get excited *(abruptly* *high-pitched)* I DO SQUEAK!

#### HELEN

Lovely! That'll be great for the editors.

#### ALEX

What was your name again? Just for my notes.

#### LYDIA

Mr. Squeakington.

#### ALEX

Mr. Squeakington. Thank you.

#### TIM

Brackets "Her/She".

#### LYDIA

Yeah.

#### HELEN

Yeah! Alex. Tell us about your character.

#### ALEX

*(nasal* *monotone)* I'm Shmerr.

#### BEN

__[sighs]__ Oh, no, he's got--

##### [Helen bursts out laughing]

#### LYDIA

SQUEAK!

#### BEN

He's got *that* voice out again!

#### LYDIA

*(simult.)* SQUEAK, SQUEAK!

#### HELEN

*(simult.)* Ohhh, no! __[laughs]__

#### BEN

Dangerous! DANGEROUS!

#### ALEX

*(simult.)* *Hot*.

#### TIM

*(simult.)* The real Mr. Squee. __[chuckles]__

#### SHMERR

I'm Shmerr. We are--

#### BEN

Okay.

#### LYDIA

Ahhhh, squeak!

#### SHMERR

I am of the dissoliums. And... we're--we're very pro-administration.

##### [soft groans]

#### SHMERR

Although my crime was I did heist an ecosystem. It was interfering with processes, so. Just sort of got rid of that one.

#### HELEN

Lovely.

#### TIM

Didn't realise we were doing these introductions in character. __[laughs]__

#### HELEN

*(simult.)* We can do!

#### SHMERR

*(simult.)* I just find it easier to find the voice, you know?

#### TIM

That's fair enough.

##### [Helen laughs]

#### LYDIA

Squeak!

#### HELEN

Ben?

#### BEN

I am Commander Unal Manspray.

##### [Lydia laughs, then groans in realisation]

#### HELEN

*(strangled* *laughter)* You actually did it.

#### LYDIA

You *actually* *went* *there!*

#### HELEN

Fantastic.

#### BEN

Uh--oh. This is an in-joke. So, to explain: Tim asked for some communal man spray--

#### TIM

Look--

#### BEN

--because this room might be hot and stinky--

#### TIM

--when you're in--

#### BEN

--so I wanted my name to be Communal Manspray.

#### ALEX

*(simult.)* His *writer* is so *excessive!*

#### BEN

*(simult.)* Commander Unal Manspray.

##### [Helen chuckling]

#### LYDIA

Y--it's--

#### TIM

He's playing up because he's in company--

#### LYDIA

Yeah.

#### TIM

--but he'll calm down.

##### [Alex bursts out laughing]

#### LYDIA

It is--__[laughs]__--that is exactly what we're all doing!

#### BEN

I haven't calmed down in three and a half years--

#### TIM

That's true. __[laughs]__

#### BEN

*--*I'm not starting now.

#### ALEX

You guys are *much* younger than I thought.

#### TIM

Yeah.

##### [Ben laughs]

#### TIM

Yup, yup yup yup.

#### HELEN

Species?

#### BEN

I'm a garblufian!

#### HELEN

Of course!

#### BEN

Everyone knows what one of those is--

#### LYDIA

Yeah, yeah.

#### BEN

--so we're moving swiftly on.

##### [Helen bursts out laughing]

#### LYDIA

*[indistinct]*, yeah.

#### BEN

My crime was desertion.

##### [Lydia gasps]

#### HELEN

Ooooooh.

#### ALEX

*(as* *Shmerr)* What dessert did you take?

##### [pause]

#### ALEX

Ba-dop-bop! I'm done.

##### [Helen chuckles]

#### ALEX

I'm done.

#### BEN

He's done.

#### TIM

*(simult.)* He's d--__[laughs]__

#### ALEX

*(simult.)* I'm done.

#### HELEN

Okay.

#### ALEX

We're done. __[laughs]__

#### HELEN

And because I am also playing--

#### LYDIA

*Yaaay!*

#### HELEN

I know! My name is Worshiper 2X7. My species is android, brackets "sentient", close brackets.

#### LYDIA

Mm-hmm.

#### HELEN

My crime is desecrating the sacred ponds.

#### LYDIA

__[bursts out laughing]__ Just the--the idea that you must have been working with Commander Urinal for that.

##### [Helen laughs]

#### LYDIA

No, it was Spray!

#### BEN

*(simult.)* UNAL Manspray!

#### TIM

*(simult.)* It's *pronounced* Uri--__[laughs]__

##### [chuckling]

#### HELEN

Right. So.

#### BEN

How dare you.

#### HELEN

We've got the basics of our characters. The way that this character creation works is that we ask each other questions. These questions are leading questions that imply something about everyone else. So, for example, the example I gave before this is "how did you get that bizarre scar on your face?" A question I've got before is "why did you abandon your son?"

##### [Lydia laughs, impressed]

#### HELEN

So, um--__[laughs]__--it can range.

#### TIM

So keeping it light and fluffy.

##### [Alex and Lydia laugh]

#### HELEN

Yeah! I mean, we--in that game we ended up finding my abandoned son on a different planet and I had to decide to abandon him again or whether to stay.

##### [Lydia gasps]

#### ALEX

*(excited)* Did you abandon him again? Did you abandon him again!

#### HELEN

I don't remember.

##### [Alex gives a disappointed sigh]

#### LYDIA

Ooohh!

#### HELEN

I was in there for political reasons. I think he betrayed the cause. I can't remember exactly what happened.

#### ALEX

Ah, fair.

#### TIM

Uh, get rid.

#### LYDIA

Ah, yeah.

#### HELEN

Yeah.

#### LYDIA

Really doesn't care about this son. __[laughs]__

#### ALEX

Also, I'm liking that we're *(laughing)* pro-abandonment here for some reason today.

##### [Helen laughing]

#### LYDIA

I--I-- __[high-pitched ambivalent noises]__

#### BEN

Pro-*double*-abandonment.

#### TIM

Yeah.

#### ALEX

Double abandonment.

#### LYDIA

*(quietly)* Oohhh.

#### ALEX

I'm so sorry.

#### TIM

Yeah, minus one son. Would abandon again.

##### [giggling]

#### HELEN

Okay. So, there is--everyone has to answer--there's a set of three mandatory questions but you only have to pick one. So, as long as one person answers one of the questions, it's fine.

#### ALEX

So, is that three between all of us? There are three--or each person has three mandatory questions.

#### HELEN

Each person answers one of the three mandatory questions.

#### ALEX

Thank you.

#### HELEN

Okay. I'm gonna pick on you again, Tim, because you're the guest.

#### TIM

I thought that.

#### ALEX

'Cause you're strange and new.

#### LYDIA

And you must suffer.

#### PILCHARDS

*(dark,* *cockney)* I can explore my character a little more.

#### HELEN

Yeah, you can. So just--

#### BEN

*(laughing)* What are you--are you one of the Kray twins?

##### [loud laughter]

#### HELEN

Oh please!

#### PILCHARDS

I'm one of the Pilchards brothers, son.

##### [laughter]

#### BEN

Are you a bandit? __[laughs]__

#### PILCHARDS

Go on.

##### [Lydia laughs]

#### HELEN

Right. I am going to ask you one of the mandatory questions.

#### PILCHARDS

Uh-huh.

#### HELEN

What do we lose by not listening to you?

#### PILCHARDS

You lose a wealth of experience! I have killed people in many interesting ways, and I am willing to share my methods.

##### [Ben snorts]

#### HELEN

Good.

#### ALEX

*(imitating* *Pilchards)* You're also rapidly turning into Michael Caine.

##### [Helen laughs]

#### PILCHARDS

I only wanted to kill one of them. But they've all died now.

#### ALEX

*(laughing)* Oh god!

#### HELEN

Lovely!

#### PILCHARDS

What a shame.

##### [Alex and Ben chuckle quietly]

#### HELEN

The floor is now open to the other players to ask you any questions we can think of. Okay, what happened to your leg?

#### PILCHARDS

Now. Look. When you are running through the undergrowth, escaping the authorities, you have to look out for knotholes! 'Cause if you don't, you'll put your foot right in a little gindle or gully and it'll tear *right* off!

#### HELEN

*(whispering)* Good to know.

#### PILCHARDS

Luckily, I have got four more, so.

#### HELEN

__[chuckles]__ Okay, so I would note down four legs.

#### PILCHARDS

Mark the four legs. Well, no, five original. Well, you know what? Let's say six, 'cause who would evolve like that? And I've lost two so far. Leaving me with a square four.

##### [quiet chuckling]

#### HELEN

Good to know.

#### PILCHARDS

Six to begin. __[laughs]__

#### BEN

How would you describe your idiosyncratic fashion sense?

##### [Lydia and Helen burst out laughing]

#### PILCHARDS

Style is... in the eye of the beholder. And unfortunately, I spend a lot of time on my own.

##### [Lydia laughs]

#### PILCHARDS

So, I've cobbled together from the, ah, various people I have bandited, which is to say stolen from, a--a--a menagerie of different styles, and, y'know, I just put it on my body and uh, whatever doesn't rot off, you know, kind of...

##### [quiet laughter]

#### PILCHARDS

...kind of becomes... what I'm going for.

##### [pause; Ben chuckles]

#### PILCHARDS

*(simult.)* I'm done.

#### HELEN

*(simult.)* Lovely.

##### [Lydia and Helen laugh]

#### HELEN

Yes, you are. *(laughing)* Okay.

#### LYDIA

*(laughing)* Yeah!

#### ALEX

What's the deal with all those machetes? It's the future.

#### PILCHARDS

Nah mate, you don't need to know.

#### HELEN

*(laughing)* They're darn secretive.

#### PILCHARDS

No, these--these--these are for my personal business and if you want to find out, I'll *show* you, but you may not... exit.

##### [Ben snorts]

#### HELEN

Wonderful. One more question.

#### LYDIA

How did you come by that unfortunate addiction?

#### BEN

Oooooh!

#### ALEX

Good one. That's much better than mine. Taking notes.

#### PILCHARDS

It's a lonely life, is banditry. You know, nobody to tell you, "Oi. That has rotted off in a way that makes it look unpleasant and not figure--"

##### [Lydia chuckles]

#### PILCHARDS

"--not figure-forming or--or--or complementary to your square shape."

##### [Lydia bursts out laughing]

#### PILCHARDS

And to fill the empty hours--

#### ALEX

*(laughing)* Forgot you were square.

#### PILCHARDS

I'm square and squat and *cross*.

##### [laughter]

#### PILCHARDS

And I fill--fill the empty hours between various passers-by falling into one of my *bandit* *pits*.

##### [Lydia laughs]

#### PILCHARDS

You know, you just push up your nose whatever you find, and it turns out what *I* found... were crystals.

##### [Lydia laughs]

#### PILCHARDS

Dunno their street name! I call 'em fun crystals.

##### [Lydia and Helen laugh]

#### PILCHARDS

They make me feel tingly in my bits.

##### [Lydia bursts out laughing]

#### PILCHARDS

Wait. Is that too hot?

##### [laughter]

#### ALEX

Hot! Hot!

#### BEN

We didn't say which bits!

#### PILCHARDS

Yeah. Fingers.

#### ALEX

Corners.

#### PILCHARDS

*(laughing)* In my corners!

##### [Lydia and Ben laughing]

#### HELEN

To be fair, we should probably not make jokes about "hot" until I've explained what--

#### TIM

Yeah.

#### LYDIA

No! We've established it.

#### BEN

Oh, it's--

#### HELEN

Oh, we've established hot?

#### BEN

We've been shouting "hot"--

#### LYDIA

*(simult.)* This is right from the beginning.

#### BEN

*(simult.)* --"dangerous" and "difficult."

#### ALEX

Yeah, this is wibbly-wobbly, like, we're already ahead of time.

#### HELEN

This is extraordinarily wibbly. Okay.

#### TIM

Yeah.

#### LYDIA

All right.

#### BEN

I'd like--__[laughs]__

##### [Helen laughs]

#### BEN

--whatever your name is--

#### HELEN

What was your name again?

#### PILCHARDS

Deraldio Pilchards.

#### ALEX

*(simult.)* Deraldio of the tingly corners. Pay attention.

#### HELEN

*(simult.)* Okay, like Pilchards over here.

#### PILCHARDS

I'm full of right angles and ready to mingle!

##### [laughter]

#### HELEN

Lovely. Lydia, what are you willing to do to be captain?

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

*(high* *pitched)* I'll gouge your eyes out! I've done it before! And I'll do it again! I've got little claws, so I take a while! They're--it's very small. See, in my dimension, we're bigger! But here we're too small! So I just have to scrabble around in your eye sockets! Eep!

##### [Ben and Tim laugh]

#### HELEN

Lovely. Monstrous budgie...

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Eep!

#### HELEN

...damage... introduced. That's your one mandatory question.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Eeeee!

#### HELEN

It's now open to the floor again.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Eep!

#### TIM

How do you feel about getting around with wings in an often-low-gravity environment?

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Eep! Furious!

##### [Helen laughs]

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Like most things!

##### [Ben chuckling]

#### TIM

Okay.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

I've seen a lot of good budgies fly too high and then... escape orbit. Asteroids and things like that. Space budgies! Fly off! Never see 'em again! Eep!

#### HELEN

What happened to all of your friends?

##### [pause; *Mr. Squeakington* whimpers]

##### [Helen giggles; Tim chuckles]

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Well, we... we were--we were trying to save as many as we could. Eep! As you can see, this is where we got... stranded in this dimension being all tiny and pet sized. Eep! People keep keeping us as pets. So, I was opening up a trans-dimensional portal system, and, uh... something went wrong. Something went... *weird*. *(quietly)* Now my... um. All my--all my friends...

#### HELEN

*Aw.*

#### TIM

Yeah.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

...sort of melted, really.

##### [laughter]

#### HELEN

Ohhh, dear. Oh, dear! Melted monstrous budgies.

#### ALEX

Tim's having a great time!

#### TIM

*(singsong)* Melty budgies!

##### [Helen laughing]

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

But inwards.

##### [Helen groans]

#### BEN

Ah, like an Easter egg in the microwave.

#### TIM

Yeah.

#### HELEN

Ohhhhh, no!

##### [Tim laughing]

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Yeah. That's what happened to all my friends. *(laughing)* I prefer not to--to think about it really too much. Eep!

#### ALEX

*(high-pitched* *incredulity)* Why are you putting your Easter eggs in the *microwave?* You're a *monster!*

#### BEN

Get 'em hot. Obviously.

#### PILCHARDS

You've got to take the foil off otherwise it creates quite the show.

##### [laughter]

#### BEN

*Um...*

#### LYDIA

And you manage to assassinate... a bunch of your enemies. Just...

#### PILCHARDS

Pop it in the microwave, watch the sparks fly.

#### LYDIA

Turn the gas on and put an Easter egg in the microwave.

##### [Ben laughing]

#### TIM

*(laughing)* I misunderstood how to explode a house! 'Cause it's in a box. It's a sealed box.

#### HELEN

Oh, my gosh.

#### BEN

You mentioned that, in this dimension, your species are kept as pets.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Eep!

#### BEN

What happened to your previous owner?

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

*(viciously pleased)* Eeeeehhhh!

##### [Helen bursts out laughing]

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Eeeeeeeeee!

#### HELEN

*(simult.)* There's a look of glee.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

*(simult.)* Eee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-heeeee!

#### TIM

Listener, if you could only see the facial expressions.

##### [Helen cackling]

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Eee! Eee-hee-hee-heeee. Eeeh! It was so awful that I described it in my language.

##### [Ben laughs]

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

So that none of you would be offended.

#### BEN

Fair.

#### HELEN

Lovely.

#### ALEX

What's a... relaxing way for Mr. Squeakington to unwind after--after a long hard day?

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

*(promptly)* Dust bath.

##### [Ben laughing]

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

A dust bath. Just like, I peck my mirror a bit.

##### [quiet laughter]

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

And then--__[laughs]__--and then just like, flap around. It's great.

##### [Ben laughing]

#### TIM

Is that a pastime that is consistent across--so even in your dimension where you're not pets, there's still like a big dust bath?

#### LYDIA

*(laughing)* Yeah.

#### TIM

And a *massive* mirror? Like a--

#### LYDIA

*(laughing)* Yeah. Just like a--

#### BEN

Yeah, they put the population of their planet as double what it is?

#### TIM

Yeah, yeah.

##### [laughter]

#### TIM

*So* many unopened Christmas cards.

#### ALEX

We'll get them one day.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

You say that humans don't like mirrors? Oh--

#### TIM

Oh, it's a damn good point.

#### BEN

Ooh!

#### TIM

Oh, think about that.

#### BEN

I don't know! I'm not a-- I'm not a human.

##### [Tim laughs]

#### BEN

*(simult.)* None of us are!

#### HELEN

*(simult.)* We have *no* humans!

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Ah, no. Eep!

#### BEN

'Cause they *suck*.

#### TIM

They suck.

#### HELEN

Yeah.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Yeah. Uh, we like... pecking at mirrors? Chewing on plastic toys? Eep!

#### HELEN

*Aww.*

##### [Tim laughs]

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Mostly I'm angry 'cause I don't have any plastic toys to peck.

#### HELEN

Good to know for later plot reasons, I guess.

##### [Tim laughs]

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Eeee!

#### TIM

And thus a character arc was founded.

##### [loud laughter]

#### TIM

The space quest for the plastic squeaky toy!

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Eee eee--!

#### HELEN

Genuinely, this could end up that way. We don't know. Because this is improvised.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Or murder.

#### TIM

Or murder.

#### ALEX

Or *both*.

#### HELEN

Yeah, murdering for--yes! Yes. I could see--okay. Alex.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Give me the mirror!

##### [Tim and Helen laugh]

#### HELEN

Alex, how would we be better off if you led?

#### SHMERR

Well, the thing about me is that I can ensure that things run smoothly, and efficiently. And when you--when you want something to go in space, you can't be faffy. 'Cause if you are, ooooh... trouble.

##### [Helen laughs]

#### SHMERR

And also, I have, uh, the, uh, authoritative bearing... of a... born... leader.

##### [pause]

#### HELEN

Yes.

##### [Lydia makes a disconcerted noise]

#### TIM

__[quiet laugh]__ So much sweat in that voice.

##### [Helen bursts out laughing]

#### LYDIA

*(simult.)* So clammy!

#### SHMERR

*(simult.)* If only there was some sort of communal man spray--

##### [Tim and Helen laugh]

#### SHMERR

--for me to make use of, but alas there is not.

#### BEN

What happened to the rest of your terrorist cell?

##### [Lydia gasps]

#### SHMERR

Oh, well, the thing is...

##### [laughter]

#### SHMERR

That's actually a bit of an awkward question.

##### [Lydia and Helen laugh]

#### SHMERR

They are actually still... fine. Once, uh--you know what they say, they say that, um, once you have--"careful, actually, you do not... work yourself out of a jo--" I made it too efficient and they did not need me anymore.

#### HELEN

*Aww.*

#### SHMERR

So now I'm here. But I hear that they are taking the eastern quadrants by storm. I don't know why they called it the eastern quadrants. You can't use a compass in space but here we are.

#### HELEN

__[chuckles]__ What did happen to all those glands?

#### SHMERR

Did you mean mine or theirs?

#### HELEN

*Ooh.*

##### [Lydia chuckles]

#### HELEN

Yours.

#### SHMERR

Mine. Well, the thing is, is actually it turns out that dissoliums... we--we have a bit of a problem when it comes to, uh, as--as our good friend was right--uh, moisture, that expands outwards from the body in a low-gravity environment. It means we tend to be surrounded by a--a very moist and, uh, pungent cloud. Which, since I have become spacefaring, I felt it best to just have my glands removed because the controls were getting very slippy and people don't like a moist leader.

##### [Lydia groans quietly]

#### HELEN

I think that's true.

#### LYDIA

See, I was gonna ask, "What are you doing about that horrible skin condition?" but I feel like you've already set up--

##### [Ben laughs]

#### HELEN

Yeahhhhhh.

#### LYDIA

Ohhhhhhhhhh. So foul.

#### HELEN

Okay. Two more... weird leading questions for Alex's character.

#### TIM

Do you always carry such a large satchel of paperwork with you?

#### SHMERR

No, I--I've had to travel light, since we've entered the--

#### HELEN

In prison.

##### [laughter]

#### SHMERR

I had to travel light in prison. I only had what I can smuggle in one of my seven orifices. But, thankfully, having done so, um, you know, I've--I've just got the core, the real core things in here for me to make use of. I will--I will stock up at the first opportunity, don't you worry. We will not run short of agenda or addendums. __[pleased snort]__

##### [Helen laughs]

#### LYDIA

What did you trade for that spectacular tattoo?

#### SHMERR

Now, that tattoo does actually have quite the fun little story attached to it.

#### LYDIA

Right. All right.

#### SHMERR

It turned out that, uh, though they were very skilled at impromptu prison tattoos, especially on the face as you might notice--

#### LYDIA

Yeeees.

#### SHMERR

--um, they were not too good at balancing their books, and they were making quite the loss on ink! Which they were having to make themselves out of, you know--

#### LYDIA

Their glands.

#### SHMERR

Yeah, basically. So, uh, what--what I did is, in exchange for--for turning around their business model, they gave me this excellent-looking phoenix. Now I realise that, what with the slight facial sagging, it's not quite as... robust--

##### [Lydia groans]

#### SHMERR

--as it should necessarily look. But I think that the sentiment is there.

#### LYDIA

Just a flop bird.

#### HELEN

Ugh!

#### SHMERR

Well, you know. You know, we will... take flight, won't we. Eh?

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

I find that offensive!

#### SHMERR

Oh, right.

#### HELEN

Oh, one dynamic already established.

#### SHMERR

It's fine. We'll establish a human resources, uh, department which can arbitrate.

#### BEN

A hu--who resources?

#### TIM

A what resources?

#### LYDIA

Yeah.

#### ALEX

A what?

#### HELEN

A personnel resources, maybe.

#### ALEX

You know, hue-man. Like the--the--the thing that--

#### LYDIA

Who-man. The man but who.

#### ALEX

No, no, no, what you do is examine peoples' auras and then based on their hues, you allocate them in a--keep up!

#### HELEN

All right.

#### BEN

*(trumpet* *noise)* *Frrt*.

##### [laughter]

#### HELEN

Now--

#### SHMERR

I'm done.

#### LYDIA

Womp wommmp.

##### [Tim laughs]

#### HELEN

Ben's character.

#### UNAL

Yes!

#### HELEN

The--Urinal. __[laughs]__

#### ALEX

*(sighing)* Oh, no.

#### UNAL

Did you think I wasn't going to be doing a voice?

##### [Lydia laughs]

#### ALEX

I just like that it becomes a competition with you and me every time.

#### BEN

Sssssorely mistaken.

#### HELEN

What do we lose by not listening to you?

#### UNAL

*(crisp* *and* *posh)* Well, I have a long and storied military career. So, that, basically. W--none of--none of the other--n-none of you are fit to lead! You're all smugglers and criminals and murderers, but I was in command of an entire legion! Hence the... Commander... bit.

#### HELEN

Right. Weird leading questions, let's make them nasty. __[laughing]__

#### TIM

Don't you think it's time to take off the uniform?

#### UNAL

*(quickly)* No.

##### [loud laughter]

#### UNAL

No, removing the uniform is admitting defeat! I was never defeated, I merely took a very tactical retreat, which was misinterpreted by high command! __[pause]__ They were wrong.

#### HELEN

Where did your wife go?

#### UNAL

Oh, she left me.

#### HELEN

Ah. But where'd she go?

##### [pause]

#### UNAL

Away.

##### [laughter]

#### HELEN

Fair. __[laughs]__

#### UNAL

I don't know. All I got was a note when I came back from tour. "I'm leaving you. You're boring. You're married to the army. Love, Your Wife."

##### [laughter]

#### TIM

That was more of a request.

#### ALEX

That was a d-- that was a req--

#### TIM

"Love your wife." I'm going.

#### UNAL

No, she didn't name herself which was... really the final insult.

##### [laughter]

#### LYDIA

Why did you miss out on that promotion?

#### UNAL

Well... they didn't agree with some of my more... *interesting* and *bold* ideas! We have *mounted* infantry. Well... how about *dis*mounted infantry? *Crawling* along the ground. *Under*neath the bushes. No one sees them coming! But they said I was mad, a fool. Well. We'll see who's a mad fool now!

#### LYDIA

Is it you?

##### [Alex and Helen laugh]

##### [pause]

#### UNAL

Signs point to yes.

##### [laughter]

#### UNAL

But I must say I'm in a bit of a nadir of my life right now, so.

#### ALEX

What actually did happen at the Pink Commode club?

#### UNAL

__[hesitates]__ Yes.

##### [Lydia bursts out laughing]

#### UNAL

One of the darker chapters in my career, of course, except for my... court marshal and subsequent imprisonment. The--the Pink Commode was a vice of mine, in which, um--well, i-it's in the name, really. We all sit in a big ring, on pink toilets and, um... do the business together.

##### [Helen laugh-groaning]

#### ALEX

*(laughing)* Oh, Christ, I regret my question.

#### UNAL

Ah. Well, you did ask!

#### TIM

Like a rugby tour. I understand.

##### [laughter]

#### BEN

No, there was no flinging.

#### TIM

*(laughing)* Oh, I understand.

##### [Lydia groans]

#### HELEN

Of course.

##### [Alex groans]

#### HELEN

All right, so, Ben can you ask me one of those three questions?

#### BEN

I can. What do we lose by not listening to you?

#### WORSHIPER

*(abrasive* *robotic* *monotone)* The absolute rationality of an android.

##### [pause; Lydia laughing quietly]

#### HELEN

This is gonna be hard 'cause I'm not a rational person.

##### [Ben and Tim laugh]

#### LYDIA

Neither is anyone that describes themselves as rational.

#### HELEN

Okay, I put "rational, question mark."

##### [Lydia laughs]

#### ALEX

*(robot* *voice)* What is... love?

#### WORSHIPER

It is a chemical aberration that we will try to stamp out.

##### [Alex wheezing with quiet laughter]

#### BEN

Who's we?

#### TIM

*Ooh.*

#### WORSHIPER

The other Worshipers. Who also desecrated the pond.

#### TIM

What was it that so offended you about this particular pond that you decided to desecrate it?

#### WORSHIPER

The meaning of religion is not in the ground but in the sky.

##### [chuckles and splutters]

#### LYDIA

I see.

#### TIM

Noted.

##### [Ben laughs]

#### LYDIA

What happened that time your power banks ran out?

#### WORSHIPER

I do not like to speak of this. But it involved... a lot... of blood!

#### LYDIA

__[half-laugh]__ Okay! Your--I won't ask "yours or someone else", but, well, that's a follow up question and I don't know if those are allowed.

#### HELEN

They are not allowed.

#### LYDIA

Squeak et cetera.

#### TIM

Squeak--__[laughs]__ squeak et anon anon.

#### BEN

What were the circumstances which led to your creation?

#### WORSHIPER

The ancient manuscripts say that all of the Worshipers... were created in order to serve the Almighty Cloud Cycle. Which is why...

##### [Ben laughs]

#### WORSHIPER

--we have separated from the main sect.

#### LYDIA

*(laughing)* So you are--

#### BEN

*(simult.)* Is your reli--

#### WORSHIPER

*(starting* *to* *laugh)* We will ascend to the heavens! To join the great Cumulus!

#### BEN

*(laughing)* This is your--is your religion GCSE geography?

##### [laughter]

#### BEN

*(simult, laughing)* And you've got the precipitation cycle!

#### TIM

*(simult, laughing)* The water cycle.

##### [continued laughter]

#### BEN

So the sacred pond doesn't have sacred things in it! It's actually the *pond* that's sacred.

#### HELEN

*(laughing)* It was created by like, a bored geography teacher.

##### [Ben laughing]

#### TIM

Like, that scrap of paper from a GCSE classroom in Barnstaple fell through a time hole and it appeared in their dimension. They were like, *(robot* *voice)* "It is God! God has spoken to us! God--"

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

We do not talk about the GCSE class in Barnstaple! Eep!

#### TIM

"God has a baseball cap and sunglasses on the cover for some reason!"

#### HELEN

*(muttering)* Okay.

#### WORSHIPER

For this reason I worship moisture!

#### BEN

Oh--oh, no.

#### HELEN

__[evil laugh]__ I know!

#### BEN

A dynamic has been created.

##### [Helen and Lydia laugh]

#### ALEX

If only I had no glands.

#### BEN

Actually, this is a very dry--you like dust baths? Lydia?

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Flap flap.

#### BEN

You have no sweat glands.

#### SHMERR

I sacrificed them.

#### BEN

So, um--

#### PILCHARDS

I've got a very dry sense of humour, I'll have you know.

##### [Helen and Lydia laugh]

#### PILCHARDS

*Very* droll.

#### HELEN

God, I can't stop thinking of you as a Kray twin. Right! That's all of our characters introduced so we're gonna take a break there.

#### LYDIA

__[laughs]__ Hot!

##### [Helen laughing]

#### ALEX

Hot! Dangerous!

#### HELEN

So, next up, we are going to describe the ship that we have... stolen? Or which has run away with us, away from the prison ship.

#### UNAL

Which has come into our possession.

#### HELEN

Yes.

#### PILCHARDS

We happened to find a ship and it is now the ship we are on.

#### HELEN

Yes. That one. So we're gonna answer this collectively. So, not entirely... leading questions this time. So, the first question is, "How is our ship unique?"

#### SHMERR

There's only one of it. That's normally the first--first requirement--

##### [Ben sighs]

#### SHMERR

--for something... being unique.

#### HELEN

__[sighs]__ Ohhh, you're so--

#### LYDIA

*(whispers)* Why?

#### BEN

I--it flies in a vertical manner. So... it's not--I know there's no, like--

#### ALEX

You're talking Boba Fett style?

#### BEN

Yeah! Yeah, it's like--it's a very *tall* ship, not a very long ship.

#### HELEN

Okay.

#### TIM

Is it like a--

#### LYDIA

Which allows for quite the precipitation cycle.

#### BEN

Yes.

#### HELEN

Ooh!

#### TIM

Yeah.

#### LYDIA

It's powered--it's got a small rainforest in the centre.

#### HELEN

Okay. Tall and vertical ship, with rainforest.

#### TIM

Which also means that it's much like a lighthouse, very tight staircases--

#### ALEX

Yeah.

#### TIM

--but lots of levels.

#### BEN

Yes.

#### ALEX

See, unfortunately, we pretty much have to entirely rely on the single lift system, I mean, these days, so...

#### TIM

And you know what--

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

*Speak* for yourself! Squeak!

##### [Helen and Tim chuckle]

#### LYDIA

Yeah. Maybe there's just one tall tree in the middle and all the staircases go around it.

#### ALEX

But it's really unnecessarily tall. Like, *improbably* tall.

#### LYDIA

It's unnaturally tall. It is...

#### HELEN

*(simult.)* Well--

#### LYDIA

*(simult.)* ...somehow also the engine.

##### [Alex laughs]

#### BEN

Ohhh, yes.

#### HELEN

*(simult.)* What's the engine?

#### TIM

*(simult.)* The Gaia Drive.

#### LYDIA

The tree.

#### ALEX

Gaia Drive, yes!

#### HELEN

Oooohh!

#### LYDIA

Yes!

#### TIM

Gaia Drive™™™. __[laughs]__

#### HELEN

Okay.

#### SHMERR

I don't like it. It's extremely hard to quantify.

#### BEN

Oh yes, your--your name is Tim.

##### [Helen and Tim groan]

#### TIM

*(trumpet* *noise)* Frrt.

#### HELEN

Okay, next one.

#### BEN

*No!* Now I was the "frrt"-d against!

##### [laughter]

#### BEN

How the "frrt" has turned!

##### [Helen cackling]

#### ALEX

The "frrrt" has become the... "frrt".

##### [laughter]

#### HELEN

How is the ship quirky or temperamental?

#### TIM

I think it was under repairs when we stole it, maybe that's the circumstances under which we were allowed to get access to it.

#### SHMERR

And it doesn't like us!

#### BEN

Yeah, the tree--

#### SHMERR

It just actively doesn't like us!

#### BEN

The tree is sentient.

#### TIM

Yeah, yeah. It's a sentient tree ship.

#### HELEN

That's fantastic.

#### LYDIA

*(simult.)* And it--it doesn't like Alex.

#### BEN

*(simult.)* And it doesn't like Al--

#### TIM

It knows it's taken.

#### SHMERR

Now, it doesn't--

#### BEN

Yes!

#### SHMERR

It doesn't like *all* of us, I'm fairly--

#### BEN

Nope, it doesn't like Alex!

#### LYDIA

*(laughing)* It doesn't like Alex.

#### TIM

*(laughing)* We all get on with it.

#### SHMERR

The *name* is *Shmerr*.

#### BEN

Sorry, it doesn't like Shmerr.

##### [Lydia and Tim laugh]

#### SHMERR

You know what? I know--now, I was speaking to Gaia and Gaia assured me that all of you are--are problematic I'm sure, and that it is not just me.

#### TIM

Yeah, I don't buy it. You don't like Schmee.

#### SHMERR

*(laughing)* The doors don't open for me.

##### [loud laughter]

#### HELEN

You have to wait there until one of us comes along.

#### SHMERR

I have to wait 'til other people enter a room and then follow behind.

#### TIM

It shuts really quickly.

#### SHMERR

And I have to do it really quickly, yes.

##### [continuing laughter]

#### BEN

Sometimes the door, like, opens just a lil' bit...

#### SHMERR

Those are a trap.

#### BEN

...and then it snaps shut.

#### SHMERR

Those--those are a trap, I've--fool me once.

##### [continuing laughter]

#### HELEN

Right.

#### TIM

And it just projects a really cool party on the other side.

##### [laughter]

#### TIM

"Whoop, look what's through here. Not for yoooou!"

#### HELEN

What does the ship lack that we need?

#### BEN

Oh--uh, moisture?

#### LYDIA

Ooh.

#### HELEN

Is the rainforest dying?

#### BEN

*(simult.)* Yeah. Yes!

#### LYDIA

*(simult.)* Nooo! __[upset high-pitched noises]__

#### TIM

It was under repairs--

#### HELEN

The tree is...

#### TIM

--because it was a dry tree!

#### BEN

Yeah.

#### HELEN

Yes!

#### ALEX

The Gaia Drive needs water.

#### TIM

Yeah.

#### BEN

Wait, so you mean our ship is... *real* thirsty.

##### [laughter]

#### BEN

*Hot.*

#### ALEX

Hot!

##### [Helen bursts out laughing]

#### ALEX

By the way, this isn't--

#### HELEN

*(simult.)* We are going to explain the "hot" thing.

#### ALEX

*(simult.)* This is an in-joke that we're gonna explain eventually. But I'm--

#### BEN

Well, it's an out--it's an in-joke that will become an out-joke.

#### LYDIA

Yeah.

#### ALEX

This is a time traveling in-joke. I love it.

##### [Helen and Tim laugh]

#### HELEN

Okay. Needs water--

#### LYDIA

Listen to the episode... backwards!

##### [Ben and Tim laugh]

#### HELEN

Please don't do that.

##### [Lydia makes warbly noises like a backwards time-skip]

#### HELEN

Yeah, that's what it will sound like. Okay. There's also a section for answering questions individually about how we interact with the ship.

#### SHMERR

I think I'm--mine's fairly...

#### LYDIA

*(laughing)* Yeah, it feels...

#### SHMERR

*(simult.)* ...fairly established by everyone.

#### LYDIA

*(simult.)* Pretty clear.

#### HELEN

No, there are two mandatory questions.

#### ALEX

Oh.

#### HELEN

You don't get to improv that bit.

#### ALEX

Ooh! Ooh.

##### [Helen chuckles triumphantly]

##### [Ben splutters]

#### ALEX

*Schooled!*

#### TIM

All of a sudden there's more *rules* than we thought there might be.

#### ALEX

*(as* *Shmerr)* I love it.

#### BEN

Helen.

#### TIM

Helen?

##### [Helen laughing hysterically]

#### ALEX

*(as* *Shmerr)* It's everything I wanted it to b--

#### LYDIA

*(startled)* Whoa!

##### [Helen shrieks, surprised]

#### TIM

Lydia has fallen over.

#### ALEX

*(as* *Shmerr)* Lydia looked far too sideways and fell off the chair.

#### LYDIA

Lydia tried to be accusatory and fell down.

##### [Tim laughs]

#### HELEN

The side-eye is too strong.

##### [Lydia laughs]

#### HELEN

Okay.

#### TIM

"I can accuse you from the floor."

##### [Lydia laughs]

#### HELEN

Now, the two questions are: how is the vessel home, and where do you find sanctuary in it?

#### LYDIA

I've got a nest.

#### HELEN

Is that...

#### LYDIA

*(simult.)* In a tree.

#### HELEN

*(simult.)* ...the way you find sanctuary?

#### LYDIA

Yeah.

#### HELEN

Okay. And how is it home for you?

#### LYDIA

It's a nest.

##### [laughter]

#### ALEX

*(simult.)* I mean, you know what?

#### HELEN

*(simult.)* That makes sense.

#### ALEX

*(simult.)* I'm fine with that as an answer. I think that's very logical.

#### LYDIA

*(simult.)* I put little--I put lots of bright things in it.

#### ALEX

Ah, there you go.

#### HELEN

Awww.

#### LYDIA

In the nest.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Which I stole! Eep!

##### [Helen laughs]

#### PILCHARDS

I found sanctuary in the very bottom of the ship because it is in many ways like the pits I used to dig. All the way down in the bottom. Sometimes things fall out of peoples' pockets and blonk-blonk-blonk down the stairs they go, *right* *to* *daddy!*

##### [laughter]

#### PILCHARDS

__[triumphant laugh]__ All mine!

#### ALEX

Daddy Deraldio.

#### HELEN

Someone is gonna sample that. "It is gonna go right to daddy!"

#### PILCHARDS

It all collects in my pit!

##### [Helen laugh-groans]

#### LYDIA

Awww.

#### ALEX

*(simult.)* Your decidedly *dry* pit.

#### LYDIA

*(simult.)* You're basically a trapdoor sp--

#### ALEX

We have established this.

#### PILCHARDS

It's not--ah, it's--it's been very well water tanked.

##### [Alex chuckles]

#### PILCHARDS

Ain't gonna get no seepage from the ground outside. Wait, we're in space. Nah, it's fine.

#### LYDIA

I mean, are you essentially a trapdoor spider?

#### PILCHARDS

This has been said.

##### [laughter]

#### PILCHARDS

I do occasionally put dry leaves over the top of my hole and *dart* *out* at small moving animals.

##### [laughter]

#### PILCHARDS

And, uh, is it--what's the other question?

#### HELEN

The two questions are how is the vessel home and how do you find sanctuary in it?

#### PILCHARDS

Well, that--yeah, it's home 'cause it's in my pit. We've already established that.

##### [Helen laughs]

#### PILCHARDS

And I've found sanctuary in my mind palace.

##### [pause; Lydia chuckling quietly]

#### HELEN

Good!

##### [chuckling]

#### HELEN

Lovely.

#### PILCHARDS

*(simult.)* Wherever--wherever I am is my--is my sanctuary.

#### LYDIA

*(simult.)* Covering a head with leaves.

#### HELEN

Okay.

#### LYDIA

*(quietly)* Multiple leaves.

#### HELEN

Okay, I'll go next. For me--

#### WORSHIPER

The vessel is home because it is the first thing I have owned. In my... not life. Existence.

#### ALEX

Version.

##### [Helen laughs]

#### LYDIA

And how do you find sanctuary? Squeak, et cetera.

##### [Alex laughs]

#### WORSHIPER

I hang out... near the leaves of the tree. That's as close as I can get to the sky.

##### [quiet wheezing chuckling]

#### WORSHIPER

Technically we are in the sky 'cause we're in space but... you know what I mean.

#### LYDIA

More sky within the sky. A sky all the way down.

#### BEN

Well, given it's its own atmosphere...

#### LYDIA

Maybe clouds.

#### TIM

Where are the clouds?

#### BEN

Yeah, perhaps when you... you know, when we get water in it, clouds will form. So--

#### WORSHIPER

Yes. I'm establishing my base early.

#### BEN

Yep.

#### WORSHIPER

*(simult.)* To take advantage of the *moisture!*

#### TIM

*(simult.)* This is where clouds might be.

#### WORSHIPER

Yes.

##### [Lydia chuckling quietly]

#### WORSHIPER

The sacred moisture.

##### [laughter]

#### BEN

Hot.

##### [Helen bursts out laughing]

#### ALEX

Dangerous! Dangerous!

#### LYDIA

*(high-pitched)* Oh my god! Very difficult!

##### [Helen and Ben laughing]

#### HELEN

Commander Urinal.

#### TIM

*(laughs)* Commander--

#### UNAL

UNAL! Manspray!

##### [laughter]

#### UNAL

Commander Unal Manspray!

#### HELEN

How is the vessel home to you?

#### UNAL

I have forged a home here. One would say something so organic and disorganised would not *be* a home to me. But I found a place in the centre of the trunk where I've laid out my things, pressed my uniform, created an office... Yes.

#### HELEN

Lovely. And where do you find sanctuary in it?

#### UNAL

There.

#### HELEN

Oh. Okay.

#### UNAL

But I find sanc--no, I find sanctuary in it because... this is a start of something new! A unit! A group!

##### [Lydia is dubious]

#### UNAL

The start of a new military. A new army!

#### HELEN

Oh no.

#### LYDIA

Oh dear.

#### PILCHARDS

*(simult.)* I doubt I agree with this.

#### UNAL

*(simult.)* Forging their own way... in this crazy, mixed-up universe!

#### SHMERR

Sounds like you need logistics, my friend.

#### HELEN

Oh, boy.

#### TIM

I sense--I sense a battlement forming.

##### [Alex laughs]

#### LYDIA

A dynamic has been established.

#### HELEN

How are we--

#### ALEX

I feel like we're in, like, uh, Walking Dead or something. "He will remember that."

##### [Helen and Ben laugh]

#### HELEN

I love saying that in real life. So, how is the vessel home for you, Shmerr?

#### SHMERR

Well, um... the--the--well, it's not *really* a home? But I have found that if I just put on a suit and hang around on the outside, Gaia can't... you know, mess with me that much.

#### LYDIA

*(laughing)* Aw-w-w-w!

##### [Ben gasping with laughter]

#### SHMERR

So, my--my home, I suppose, is the--the quiet of... waiting outside with my mag-boots on.

#### TIM

So, it's important to remember he's an outside Shmerr.

##### [laughter]

#### SHMERR

I mean, not by choice but...

##### [Tim chuckles]

#### SHMERR

...you know, we roll with the punches.

#### HELEN

And where do you find sanctuary in it?

#### SHMERR

Well, I--I--I find it as a sanctuary, you know, because I'm a fixer? You know. People like me...

##### [Lydia snickers]

#### SHMERR

...because what I do is I--I fix problems.

#### LYDIA

__[laughs]__ I apologise for that noise.

#### SHMERR

And this--this enormous tree-based system is a problem which I will fix, and everyone will love me for it, including, ironically, the tree, but I don't think that the Gaia Drive knows that yet, but... Gaia Drive will like me.

#### HELEN

Lovely.

#### LYDIA

Great.

#### HELEN

Okay. The next direction is to draw the ship, but because this is primarily an audio format, we'll be skipping that.

#### ALEX

I drew a tree and then put a... line around it.

#### TIM

Tube. A tube.

#### BEN

How about--how about we just... if the audience wants to draw the ship...

#### HELEN

Yeah!

#### TIM

*(simult,* *singing)* Draw the ship. Send it to us.

#### HELEN

*(simult.)* And then tweet us the pictures.

#### BEN

Yea.

#### HELEN

Yes.

#### BEN

Yea.

#### ALEX

Ah, Lydia's already basically done. Just make sure you put me on the outside clinging on.

#### BEN

All right, cancel that, no one else draw the ship.

##### [Lydia laughing]

#### BEN

We'll post up Lydia's drawing and that is that. That's it. That's canon.

#### ALEX

Currently I'm the only one so the ship is mine apparently.

#### TIM

*(quieter)* Hey guys, draw a ship and send it to me privately [@tctmeredith](https://twitter.com/StellarTim).

#### ALEX

And then blend the streams and have... Jonny the Archivist in it--

#### TIM

Yeah.

#### ALEX

--chilling out with Trexel.

#### TIM

Oh!

#### ALEX

Anyway--

#### HELEN

Wouldn't it be like the isolation--anyway.

##### [Alex laughs]

#### LYDIA

I made a tree. __[puts pencil down]__ Done.

#### HELEN

Lovely. Thank you very much.

#### LYDIA

You're on the outside, he's a spider, and I've got a nest.

##### [Tim laughs]

#### ALEX

Everyone?

#### BEN

So, where am I?

#### ALEX

Golf clap.

##### [polite golf clapping]

#### HELEN

Oh.

#### LYDIA

Inside.

#### HELEN

Very, very lovely.

#### LYDIA

With a hat on.

#### UNAL

Very good! Yes. A regimental hat!

#### HELEN

So. To explain--

#### LYDIA

And the android is... plugged in.

#### HELEN

The ship's plugged in?

#### LYDIA

Well, you see, you need power.

#### HELEN

The tree is plugged in?

#### BEN

We never asked! Can we ask you an extra question?

#### LYDIA

Yeah, I wanna know how you're powered.

#### HELEN

Me?

#### BEN

Yeah!

#### HELEN

Yeah.

#### BEN

What's your power source?

#### LYDIA

Yeah.

#### HELEN

__[laughs]__ Um... Ooh! I know.

#### WORSHIPER

My power source is *also* moisture.

#### BEN

Ahhh.

#### LYDIA

Ahh.

#### WORSHIPER

So we have a limited amount of time before I power down.

#### LYDIA

Oh no.

#### WORSHIPER

*(simult.)* And... lose all of my protocols.

#### LYDIA

*(simult.)* Last time there was a power down... there was a lot of blood!

#### TIM

Yeah, apparently.

##### [Alex laughs]

#### WORSHIPER

Operate on default settings!

#### LYDIA

Ohh, dear.

#### BEN

Wait. Wait, the blood was... it'll replace... yeah!

#### LYDIA

Default: blood.

#### ALEX

Default: murder. Kill.

##### [laughter]

#### ALEX

Exsanguinate. Murder! Kill! Exsanguinate!

#### TIM

*(robot* *voice)* Low on power. Must find water. Nearest water: blood in person. Kill person. Suck blood.

#### HELEN

Basic-- I'm a VAMPIRE ROBOT!

##### [cheers]

#### HELEN

The coolest being!

#### LYDIA

Mind blown! Mind blown!

#### TIM

And you're blown?

#### HELEN

Everything all right over there?

#### LYDIA

Mind.

#### TIM

*(laughing)* Oh, I see.

#### LYDIA

Mind blown, not *mine* blown.

#### TIM

Mine! Blown!

#### HELEN

Right. So, the way that this is actually gonna work is essentially it's going to be a series of improvised scenes. Taking turns, each of us is going to set up the scene. We're gonna say where the scene is taking place, who is there, and explain what's happening. So, for example, I might say, "We're down in the pit and the budgie has gone to discuss where the nearest water source is with Pilchards." And then they just sort of discuss it amongst themselves, and we laugh. Now... __[laughs]__

##### [laughter]

#### TIM

Such fun we will have. *(documentary narrator voice)* Listener, please, won't you come along with us on this *hi*larious journey.

#### ALEX

Hot!

#### TIM

*(laughing)* Hot.

#### HELEN

Okay. So...

#### LYDIA

You do need to--

#### HELEN

...thank you for that segue.

##### [Lydia laughs]

#### ALEX

*(pleased)* I'm helping, apparently.

#### HELEN

So... do we--

#### LYDIA

Dangerous!

#### HELEN

Are we going to use this rule or not?

#### LYDIA

Yes!

#### BEN

*(simult.)* I think we have to use the "hot" rule now.

#### ALEX

*(simult.)* I mean, we *really* have to now.

#### HELEN

I think we have to use it now. Okay. So. If at any point a scene between the characters becomes difficult, dangerous, or hot--

#### ALEX

Hot!

##### [Lydia laughs]

#### TIM

Hot.

#### HELEN

--anyone has to shout out one of those adjectives. So, for example, if someone is going to try and... climb the entire tree, we'll say--

#### ALEX

*(simult.)* Hot!

#### HELEN

*(simult.)* --difficult.

#### ALEX

Oh. Yes. That one. __[laughs]__

#### HELEN

"Difficult" is what we will say, Alexander.

#### ALEX

But if someone was gonna be climbed *like* a tree...

#### HELEN

It would be *hot!*

#### ALEX

Hot! Right.

#### TIM

And dangerous.

##### [laughter]

#### HELEN

Dangerous might be if you're trying to open the airlock, for example.

#### SHMERR

Just come inside.

#### BEN

Yeah.

#### HELEN

Hot!

#### BEN

I go through it, like the--

##### [laughter]

#### LYDIA

OoohhhhhhhhhhHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHhhh.

#### HELEN

And that's how it's gonna work. As soon as this--

#### LYDIA

Sorry, that's just--that was the tension coming out.

##### [Tim and Helen laugh]

#### TIM

Wound like a coiled spring.

#### LYDIA

Who-o-oaaa!

#### TIM

Pwang!

#### LYDIA

Wanggg!

#### HELEN

As soon as "dangerous", "difficult", or "hot" is uttered, the scene ends because that is a cliffhanger. And the next time you come back to a scene with one of the characters involved, we have to decide how that situation was resolved.

#### ALEX

Okay.

#### HELEN

If the thing is dangerous, then it probably involves someone getting hurt or endangered. If it is difficult, then you have to probably get something that was needed before it can be done successfully. If it's both, then you failed and endangered everyone. So, difficult and dangerous would be opening an airlock that was stuck.

#### LYDIA

On fire.

#### HELEN

Yes! That too.

#### ALEX

And full of spiders.

#### TIM

Full of s--

#### HELEN

All of those, difficult and dangerous.

#### ALEX

*Hot.*

#### HELEN

You will not be able to do it but, you know--

#### LYDIA

*(simult.)* What happens if we--

#### HELEN

*(simult.)* --we will decide an interesting way--

#### LYDIA

What happens--how do we resolve hot scenes? Do we not show that? Is that censored?

#### TIM

Yeah.

#### ALEX

You--no, what you do is you suddenly cut to a bunch of, like, 1950s stock footage--

#### LYDIA

*(simult,* *Marvin* *Gaye's* *"Let's* *Get* *it* *On**")* Bowp-wowp-wowp-wowwwwwww!

#### ALEX

*(simult.)* --of people, like, hosing down streets...

##### [Helen laughs]

##### [Lydia continues singing]

#### ALEX

...fireworks going off...

#### TIM

A train going into a tunnel.

#### ALEX

A train entering a tunnel. Tim gets it.

#### TIM

Just oil derricks going up and down...

##### [Alex and Lydia laughing]

#### TIM

Yeah no, I understand. I've watched 1950s *filth.*

##### [Alex laughs]

##### [pause]

#### HELEN

Huh. Right.

##### [laughter]

#### TIM

Dwell on it!

##### [Helen and Tim laugh]

#### TIM

Shaking fist!

#### HELEN

There is also an extra section about meeting other alien species but we're gonna skip that for time. So if we do meet other aliens, we're just gonna decide what they're like.

#### LYDIA

We're just gonna ro--or just rock it.

#### HELEN

We're just gonna roll with it!

#### BEN

*(simult.)* We're just gonna rock it.

#### LYDIA

*(simult.)* Roll, roll, rollllll with them rocking it.

#### HELEN

Okay. And that's--

#### LYDIA

*(laughing, continuing desperately)* Rocking this--

##### [Helen and Tim laugh]

#### TIM

No, no. Keep going. It's getting better.

##### [Lydia laughs; mouth trumpet noise]

#### TIM

*(laughing)* Just do a trumpet!

#### LYDIA

Everyone was--

##### [Tim makes a trumpet noise]

#### ALEX

*(laughing)* My h--

#### BEN

There's just a really small elephant on the table.

##### [Tim laughs]

#### HELEN

How are you making--okay. So, just as a reminder, can everyone go around and say their names? I am Worshiper 2X7.

#### PILCHARDS

Uh, my name is Deraldio Pilchards.

#### HELEN

Mm-hmm.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Mr. Squeakington!

#### SHMERR

Shmerr.

#### UNAL

Commander Unal Manspray.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Squeak!

#### HELEN

Okay.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Squeak.

#### PILCHARDS

It--it does sound like urinal, doesn't it?

#### LYDIA

*(laughing)* Yeah.

#### UNAL

No! It's *Unal!*

#### PILCHARDS

All right, Urinal.

#### UNAL

It is a great name!

#### HELEN

Does anyone have any ideas for opening scene, or shall I come up with one?

#### TIM

I think, yeah, you start.

#### LYDIA

*(simult.)* Yeah, you start. You're in charge.

#### HELEN

*(simult.)* Yeah, I should start.

#### ALEX

We'll respect your authori-tah.

#### TIM

Autho--

#### HELEN

Aww.

#### BEN

Wowwww.

#### HELEN

What?

#### BEN

Not only is it a South Park reference, it's a South Park reference from TWENTY YEARS AGO.

#### LYDIA

*(simult.)* It's a deep cut.

#### ALEX

*(simult.)* I'm topical.

#### LYDIA

It's a deep cut.

#### HELEN

Okay. In which case, I would like Unal, can you try and recruit Pilchards to your army?

#### TIM

Where is this taking place?

#### HELEN

Ooh. In your pit, I think.

#### TIM

In my pit.

#### UNAL

Pilchards, come out of that damn hole!

#### PILCHARDS

This is my safe place. If you wanna talk to me, you can come on downstairs.

#### UNAL

There's a dirty great pit!

#### PILCHARDS

It's a lovely pit.

##### [Lydia laughs]

#### UNAL

So--okay, it's a dirty great lovely pit!

#### PILCHARDS

It's a lovely, dirty pit and if you want to talk to me you will descend, sir.

#### UNAL

Oh, *fine*, I will. How do you get down? Is there a rope or something?

#### PILCHARDS

Just lift up the leaves and dry grass that I've placed over the lid.

##### [trees leaves rustle]

#### UNAL

Okay. That's very well camouflaged. I'm glad I didn't step in that.

#### PILCHARDS

Yeah.

##### [Lydia laughs]

#### UNAL

Right. So I'll just--okay. Uh--

#### PILCHARDS

Just sit down. Just take a seat. If you've got anything in your pockets--nah, actually, I'll find out, don't tell me.

##### [pause; quiet laughter]

#### PILCHARDS

How can I help you, Ural? What do you want?

#### UNAL

Well, Pilchards, I've been thinking. Now that we are out of the clutches of the corrupt law, we should create some sort of, uh, force of our own. Strike out into the--the--the great dark beyond? Uh, you seem to be, uh, an individual with a--a love of machetes.

#### PILCHARDS

Mm.

#### UNAL

Um, you certainly have a lot of them.

##### [Lydia laughing]

#### PILCHARDS

Yeah.

#### UNAL

And I was thinking you might be, um, useful as a-a-an infantry man! Have you ever been in the army, Pilchards?

#### PILCHARDS

Yeah, an army of sorts. If by army you mean I kill people in a forest.

#### UNAL

Well, yes, if the...

##### [chuckling]

#### UNAL

...an army is doing arboreal manoeuvres, we may need to, um, see action in a forest, so.

#### PILCHARDS

Yeah.

#### UNAL

That would work very well.

#### PILCHARDS

Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna stop you there, Ural. Don't you remember me, Ural? No?

#### UNAL

Uh--it's--it's Unal. And, uh, no, I can't say I--

#### PILCHARDS

No?

#### UNAL

No, I've nev--no.

#### PILCHARDS

No? Now remember, uh--now, it was about--was that four, five years ago? Your squadron was doing manoeuvres in the outer belt. Thought you'd come onto a little planet of mine, didn't ya? "Oh, oh, let's stop the *bandit* activity", you said.

#### UNAL

Oh yes! Those horrible, dirty bandits!

#### PILCHARDS

Yeah, that would--

#### UNAL

They dug a lot of holes every----I see! I see what's happened here.

#### PILCHARDS

Yeah, traditionally two and two do make four, don't it?

##### [Lydia chuckles]

#### UNAL

Yes.

#### PILCHARDS

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so, why don't you pop up those lil' stairs into your lil' trunky office with your military histories--

#### UNAL

Okay.

#### PILCHARDS

--yeah, and your lil' books, and you lil' regimental soldiers. I've heard you playin' with them. I've heard you playin'. Ooh, oh look at you, remembering the past. *It's* *dead,* *the* *past* *is* *dead,* *Urinal.* The past is dead!

#### UNAL

It's Unal.

##### [laughter]

#### PILCHARDS

And if you don't keep out--if you don't keep out of my way, cakey boy, then you... are gonna get it.

#### UNAL

*(briskly)* Okay, well, uh, so that's a no to the army then?

##### [laughter]

#### PILCHARDS

It's a hard pass, Urinal Cakes.

#### UNAL

All right, well... well just--just--just think about it.

#### PILCHARDS

Yeah.

#### UNAL

Uh, maybe when we're in some sort of dire straits and you need somebody with the... tactical brilliance of--

#### PILCHARDS

Yeah.

#### UNAL

--of *Commander* Unal *Manspray*, you'll think of me.

#### PILCHARDS

Yeah, I'm more of a lone wolf spider if I--if I'm honest.

##### [Lydia and Alex laugh]

#### UNAL

Okay. Well I'll just... climb out of this horrible, dirty pit you live in.

##### [tree leaves rustle]

#### PILCHARDS

Yeah. Yeah, you do that. And--

#### UNAL

I am doing that. I'm doing that right now.

#### PILCHARDS

Thanks for the mints, by the way.

#### UNAL

Oi! What? My--

#### PILCHARDS

Num num num num.

#### UNAL

My *mints!*

##### [laughter]

#### HELEN

And cut!

#### TIM

Num num num. __[laughs]__

#### BEN

And that is how Pilchards eats.

##### [continued laughter]

#### BEN

Num num num.

#### TIM

Oh look, some food. Num num. __[laughs]__

#### HELEN

I should mention as well. If, like--if a scene ends that's not dangerous, difficult, or hot, someone can just say cut.

#### TIM

Yeah.

#### LYDIA

Yeah, it was--

#### HELEN

That was very good. Thank you very much. That was exactly what I wanted.

##### [Tim and Helen laugh]

#### LYDIA

Ohhhh, the backstory!

#### BEN

It's almost like we do an improv podcast together.

#### TIM

You've gotta do it--

#### HELEN

Yes! It's almost like I strategically picked!

#### LYDIA

It's like you might know each other from some... past...

#### BEN

Nah, no.

##### [Helen laughs]

#### LYDIA

...experience. Maybe some shared... experience.

#### TIM

*(as Pilchards)* A conflict dynamic's all right if you get on with the person in real life.

##### [Lydia and Helen chuckle]

#### HELEN

Right.

#### LYDIA

*If.*

#### BEN

*If.*

##### [Helen chuckles]

#### BEN

Big, big if.

##### [Lydia chuckles]

#### HELEN

Now. So obviously this is a turn-based thing, so Tim, now you can choose...

#### LYDIA

Oooh.

#### HELEN

...the characters you want, the location, and what's happening.

#### TIM

*(laughing)* Right. Um, in which case, this next scene will take place right at the top of the ship where, uh...

##### [scene background SFX: birds tweeting]

#### HELEN

Worshiper 2X7.

#### TIM

...Worshiper 2X7 is deeply contemplating the world outside the porthole. And I think Mr. Squeakington--

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Eep!

#### TIM

--has fluttered up to converse.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Eep!

#### HELEN

About what?

#### TIM

About... oohh, that's a good question, buddy. __[laughs]__

#### HELEN

Maybe about moisture. __[laughs]__

#### LYDIA

Yeah.

#### TIM

Yeah, yeah. Yeah, maybe about her obsession--

#### HELEN

Getting the water for the drive--__[laughs]__

#### TIM

Yeah. Yeah, the overall, the overall mission. What are going for here?

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Eeeh! Eee! Eee!

#### WORSHIPER

Yes.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Eeeh! Eeh--we're... out of fuel. Eep!

#### WORSHIPER

I am aware.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

What are you gonna do about it?

#### WORSHIPER

I am looking--

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Eeeerrhhh!

#### WORSHIPER

--out of the--DO NOT INTERRUPT ME.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

RRRRRRHHHHHH I'm just so angry! Eep!

#### WORSHIPER

I understand the feeling.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Eep.

#### WORSHIPER

I am looking out of the porthole to see if there are any other planets in sight.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Eeehh! An asteroid? Made of water?

#### WORSHIPER

I don't think those exist.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

All--most asteroids are made of water. That is what they're made of.

#### WORSHIPER

Are they not made of rocks?

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

No. The comets, rather I meant. Comets are made of water, yeah. They've got a water trail.

#### BEN

They're ice.

#### HELEN

OH! __[laughs]__

#### BEN

*(simult.)* So, water is ice, sorry.

#### ALEX

*(simult.)* So, an asteroid is an asteroid that's made of rock, and a comet is an asteroid that's made of ice. Them's... them's the breaks!

#### WORSHIPER

Well, you should have clarifie--

##### [Helen laughs]

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

To be fair, I am a budgie.

##### [laughter]

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

An interdimensional one. But still, it's a lot of knowledge to fit in a *very* *tiny* *head!*

##### [quiet laughter]

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

As I've explained to you before, we got *shrunk* in the interdimensional transfer and I've lost a lot of ideas.

##### [laughter]

#### WORSHIPER

Of course.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Now my memory is just end.

#### WORSHIPER

That is all right. I have lots of memory.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Oh, good.

##### [spluttering laughter]

#### WORSHIPER

So. We are looking for a comet?

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Yeah! Um--do we just like--uh--should we just look out the window for one? Or... are there any more technological options?

#### WORSHIPER

Maybe there is a scanner somewhere.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Squeak! Sounds like a mission, squeak.

#### WORSHIPER

Would you like to accompany me down the trunk?

#### LYDIA

Flaps furiously.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

EEEEEEEHHHH!!

##### [Helen laughs]

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Meeep-meep!

#### HELEN

Okay, so we're going down the trunk.

#### LYDIA

Yeah.

#### BEN

Cuuuuut?

#### HELEN

I think cut.

#### ALEX

I think that's a cut.

#### HELEN

Yes. Oh!

#### ALEX

I feel like if it's difficult to literally move around, it might get real old, *real* quick.

##### [laughter]

#### HELEN

Okay. Gotten Pilchards and Unal have had a falling out.

#### BEN

Yes.

#### HELEN

Worshiper 2X7 and the Budgie are on a mission down the trunk to find--

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Eep-eep!

#### HELEN

__[laughs]__ Yeah! To find technological solutions.

#### SHMERR

*(awkward* *tune)* Boop boop badoop.

##### [Ben laughs]

#### SHMERR

*(awkward* *tune)* Out here on my own.

#### HELEN

Lydia.

#### LYDIA

Yeah.

#### HELEN

What is the next scene that you would like to see?

#### LYDIA

I'd like to see Commander Unal trying to recruit the android.

##### [Tim laughs]

#### HELEN

OHOHOHOO! __[laughs]__

#### TIM

*(mocking* *Shmerr's* *song)* Always on your own!

##### [*Shmerr* sighs]

#### BEN

You're gonna have to give yourself a scene.

#### SHMERR

No, it's--it's fine. In a lot of ways, this is everything that I expected.

##### [laughter]

#### SHMERR

In a lot of--in--you know, in some ways, our fate is what we make for ourselves. So, what I've made for myself is a small dent on the left port vent.

#### TIM

Can we make this airlock more soundproof?

##### [laughter]

#### BEN

Just whispering through the cracks!

##### [laughter]

#### HELEN

Oh no, you've got cracks in the airlocks, that's bad.

#### SHMERR

*(static)* *Tccchhht--*guys, turn on the radio, please.

##### [laughter]

#### SHMERR

*Tccchhht--(laughing)* it's so cold. *Tccchht!*

##### [chuckling]

#### BEN

Was it Schmee Eiffel?

##### [Alex laughs]

#### HELEN

Okay. Where's the location? Do you want to be with--

#### LYDIA

Oh. Uhhh...

#### HELEN

*(simult.)* --me when he approaches me?

#### BEN

*(simult.)* Yeah, I could be bumping into you looking for a--

#### LYDIA

Oh yeah! Yeah, we could bump into--as we're going down the trunk.

#### ALEX

Well, you've gotta go down the middle of the trunk in order to get to the bottom.

#### TIM

Yeah.

#### LYDIA

Yeah, there's a spiral staircase, I assume, around the trunk.

#### TIM

Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

#### HELEN

Okay.

#### LYDIA

Not that that matters to me. Flappin', flappin' violently.

#### HELEN

Okay.

#### LYDIA

I do everything violently.

#### HELEN

So, it's a scene with the three of us.

#### LYDIA

Yeah.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Eep!

#### HELEN

Okay.

#### UNAL

Ah! Worshiper! And, uh, Mr. Squeakington!

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Eeeep.

#### UNAL

Very good to see you both. Um, I... have a proposal for you, Worshiper, particularly.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

*(disapproves)* Eeeeep.

#### UNAL

But also you, Mr. Squeakington, if you--

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Eeeep?

#### UNAL

--if you wish to... join up--I--I was thinking, and I've raised this idea with Pilchards down below and--and...

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Eeep.

#### UNAL

...yeah, I think... he seems... maybe... trepidatiously interested.

##### [Lydia snickers]

#### UNAL

Well, I was thinking that, now we have a new lease of--of freedom, uh, away from, uh, galactic *injustice*.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Eep?

#### UNAL

You see?

#### WORSHIPER

*(simult.)* Yes, and towards the moisture.

#### UNAL

*(simult.)* Justice, not injustice, yes--yes, very-- yes. Moisture everywhere. So I was thinking--

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Really? Where? 'Cause we're quite short.

#### UNAL

Well, exactly. So I was thinking that we need some sort of organisational structure! Uh, in order to--to--to best *logistically* *organi**s**e* ourselves, uh, to finding some water! So, I was thinking, maybe we--we ha--we have some sort of unit? And we could--

#### WORSHIPER

And I could be the leader.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Eep! I'm the leader.

#### UNAL

Well--

#### WORSHIPER

No.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

I was the leader of my cell, of Underground Railroad budgies.

#### UNAL

Well, I am a commander. Obviously. Uh, it's in the name. *Commander...*

#### WORSHIPER

*(simult.)* I am the most logical.

#### UNAL

*(simult.)* ...*Unal* Manspray.

#### WORSHIPER

I have the least flesh.

#### UNAL

Ah! Well, actually--um, you'll find--in--in--in--

#### WORSHIPER

I think you have a lot of flesh.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Yeah.

#### UNAL

I do. I am a--a--a biological... organism, as is tradition, for the--

#### WORSHIPER

Deficient. Deficient.

#### UNAL

Okay. Uh...

##### [Tim laughs]

#### UNAL

Right.

#### WORSHIPER

I am the best choice.

#### UNAL

Well... well...

##### [Lydia laughing]

#### UNAL

Well, we--we *did* have a logistics officer who was very rational, very--very good at, uh, knowing where to go next. But you need somebody with more of a--a *personable* outlook to be sort of at the top of the pile. Uh--

#### WORSHIPER

I am extremely likeable.

#### UNAL

Are you!

##### [Tim laughs]

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Eep!

#### WORSHIPER

Everybody loves Worshiper 2X7.

#### UNAL

Well--well then, what--what a good idea. We'll have to put it to a vote! We should have some sort of crew meeting in our new... uh--new world order!

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

It's much more urgent that we find fuel or we're all gonna--eep!--die.

#### UNAL

Well, exactly. But if we're all pulling in opposite directions, we don't move anywhere at all. So, I was thinking that we have a meeting to set up a-an organisational structure, and we can then pull in the *same* direction, with our own... ranks, and hats.

##### [quiet chuckling]

#### WORSHIPER

I do not recognise hats.

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

Yep.

#### UNAL

Well, they're, um, small items of clothing that you put on top of your head, like the one that I'm wearing now. That's a h--

#### WORSHIPER

I do not recognise their authority.

##### [Lydia laughs]

#### UNAL

Uh, well they're not--the hat isn't actually the authority, it's more of a symbol of--of authority. Uh--

#### MR SQUEAKINGTON

I do recognise symbols.

##### [Alex chuckling quietly]

#### UNAL

Well, cymbals tend to go on drum kits? Uh, they're large disks of metal.

#### TIM

*(laughing)* Cut!

##### [Helen bursts out laughing]

#### ALEX

Cut! Cut it. Please!

#### TIM

Wow. A self-assurance rock meets a confidence hard place and nobody--

##### [laughter]

#### TIM

--tremendous work.

##### [laughter dying down]

#### HELEN

Okay. Right! Well--

#### LYDIA

Yeah, but this is difficult.

##### [laughter]

#### HELEN

Well, it depends on what you're--

#### LYDIA

No no--

#### HELEN

--if you're trying to arrange a crew meeting.

#### LYDIA

__[laughs]__ Yeah.

#### BEN

Yes.

#### SHMERR

If only one of you would accept a very eager helper.

##### [laughter]

#### SHMERR

You'd have that one little advantage, but no. Boh-doop boop!

#### TIM

*(simult,* *Shmerr* *voice)* Buh-doop, bah-doop, ba bop!

#### SHMERR

*(simult.)* Boop badoop boop boop!

#### BEN

Yeah, do--we could--

#### LYDIA

It's like--a face drifts past a porthole.

##### [Helen bursts out laughing]

#### SHMERR

Hey.

#### TIM

Just pointing at itself. "A-ha? Why not?"

#### HELEN

Okay, so we'll cut that there. I guess you'll find out next week if the... crew meeting actually happens.

#### TIM

Ooh, such stakes.

#### LYDIA

*(laughing)* Or if we run out of fuel.

##### [Helen laughing]

#### ALEX

We're gonna run out of fuel and die in space doing *nothing!*

##### [Tim chuckles]

#### LYDIA

Before the android goes on a bloodthirsty rage.

#### BEN

And anyone talks to Shmerr.

##### [laughter]

#### TIM

To be fair! To be fair. In like--in real-time, in like real-time stuff, like maybe eight minutes has happened. So, I think we can--I think we can *(laughing)* have a crew meeting.

#### ALEX

All is lost.

#### BEN

Oh, you don't know how long the ship is.

#### LYDIA

Yeah.

#### TIM

That's true.

#### BEN

It's very long.

#### TIM

Could be two days from tip to tail.

##### [laughter]

#### ALEX

We're done.

#### TIM

We're d--__[laughs]__

#### LYDIA

I'm a very small budgie.

#### HELEN

Yes. We are all now done.

#### ALL

Bye!

#### HELEN

My species is android, brackets "sentient," close--a blose--close brackets. Oh, gosh. Please edit that bit out so I don't sound like I'm completely tripping over my *entire* mouth. Um...

#### LYDIA

*(simult.)* You need to do another version.

#### TIM

*(simult.)* You need to say a clean take. You can't just edit it out.

#### BEN

*(simult.)* Yeah, you can't--

#### HELEN

Okay. Really--

##### [loud laughter]

#### LYDIA

Just edit--could you just...

#### BEN

Just work around it.

#### LYDIA

*(simult,* *laughing)* ...edit all of my words.

#### TIM

*(simult.)* My species is... and--and my crime...

##### [Helen laughing]

#### ALEX

Lowri, just--

#### BEN

Yeah, Lowri just--it's like, "My species is... *(different* *voice)* android."

##### [laughter]

#### ALEX

So, Lowri, what I'd really like you to do is take what we have here, and could you just edit it into something entirely different.

#### TIM

Yeah.

#### LYDIA

Yeah.

##### [laughter]

#### ALEX

Maybe a reading of Tolstoy...

##### [laughter continues]

#### ALEX

...I mean...

#### HELEN

Look.

#### ALEX

*(simult.)* *...*maybe a BBC 16-part drama.

#### HELEN

*(simult.)* I don't know how it works! It may as well be *magic* to me!

#### TIM

Just cut out the syllables.

##### [laughter]
