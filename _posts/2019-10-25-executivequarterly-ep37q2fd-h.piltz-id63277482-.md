#### SIGMUND

Hello, and welcome to Executive Quarterly with me, Sigmund Shankeray. I'm joined today by one of the rising stars of Stellar Firma's executive class, Hartro Piltz. Hartro, how are you?

#### HARTRO

I am fantastic. [__SIGMUND:__ Hmm.] Thank you for having me, Sigmund. It is a-- it is a real pleasure to be here today.

#### SIGMUND

Well, it's an absolute pleasure for me as well, because, as I say, you really are a rising star amongst the young executives of Stellar Firma. But, __[chuckles]__ as we all know, stars can suddenly explode for no reason and leave nothing but screams and shadows.

#### HARTRO

Yes, that's true. That's-- that is true. And I like to think that I'm constantly trying to exceed myself and-- and fly further into the galaxy of success so that, as not to burn out, but to continually become a larger star. [__SIGMUND:__ Yes.] Not-- not to fade out, not to explode, but to succeed in becoming brighter... [__SIGMUND:__ Mm-hmm.] as an emblem for other line managers.

#### SIGMUND

Okay, we're going to have a question now. Um, just going to ask you a series of questions to help really get to the bottom of what makes a line manager and rising executive such as yourself tick. Is that okay?

#### HARTRO

That's fantastic.

#### SIGMUND

Okay. So, Hartro, what's a perfect day look like to you?

#### HARTRO

Oh, Sigmund, I'm so glad you asked! I'm quite regimented, I'm happy to say. I like things just so. I wake up at four every morning. I have my alarm clock. It jolts me out of bed with a friskness, you know, with a--

#### SIGMUND

Do you have an electric alarm clock that tasers you as you wake up?

#### HARTRO

I've seen those! I've heard of those. I-- I actually have one that's inserted into my bed and it flips the bed slightly.

#### SIGMUND

Interesting.

#### HARTRO

It's-- it's-- it's, um, called The Shelling.

#### SIGMUND

Ah! And it-- and it shells you out of your sleep [__HARTRO:__ Exactly.] into the wall of the-- onto the wall of your room?

#### HARTRO

Onto the floor.

#### SIGMUND

Okay.

#### HARTRO

Yeah. I don't have any carpet. I like to really smack awake. That's just to freshen me up to get me going, you know. Some mornings I even land on my feet and I know it's going to be a good day!

#### SIGMUND

__[chuckles]__ Like a cat!

#### HARTRO

Yes. Yes. __[both laugh]__ Like a sexy cat.

#### SIGMUND

Excellent. Excellent stuff. So Hartro, if you could change anything about your job, what would it be?

#### HARTRO

Absolutely nothing, Sigmund. I--

#### SIGMUND

Oh, come now!

#### HARTRO

I-- no. No, really.

#### SIGMUND

_(crosstalk)_ Oh, come now, nothing?

#### HARTRO

You-- you jest. No really. No, it is a *joy* to work for Stellar Firma. I mean, bless the Board I have come to where I have come. You know, everyday as I smack my face on the floor of my cubicle and alight into action to come and deliver line managerial dictation and-- and-- and* joy*. I just feel like I am the luckiest woman to serve the Board. I love my job!

#### SIGMUND

Hail the Board.

#### HARTRO

Hail the Board.

#### SIGMUND

Okay, but seriously, anything, anything you'd change? Anything you're dissatisfied with?

#### HARTRO

Sigmund, not a thing.

#### SIGMUND

Nothing?

#### HARTRO

In fact, I'd... I'd work longer. I'd work harder.

#### SIGMUND

Noted. Noted. Okay, well, next question then. A line--

#### HARTRO

Is it hot in here? Ha.

#### SIGMUND

It is a-- it is a little warm. I'll just turn it __[knob being turned]__ up a little. A line manager's job can be very hard and-- and very taxing. [__HARTRO:__ No.] Does it ever get too much?

##### [heater fans blowing]

#### HARTRO

No. __[small chuckle]__ No. Absolutely not. Neve-- No. I love, I love everyone I work with. I-- we're like a family. Eh, ha, it's like going to work with your friends. [__SIGMUND:__ Mm.] And, uh, I say I'm a line manager but really, I'm a buddy. You know, I--

#### SIGMUND

So, you fraternise? You fraternise with your employees?

#### HARTRO

Sigmund, now, come on, now. You know, from one professional to another, you want them to have a feeling of, you know, oh, they *could* fraternise with you. You know, they might think "oh, we could" but absolutely not. I mean, I know where the line is. I know where the line-- I know when to put my foot down!

#### SIGMUND

_(crosstalk)_ Mm. You're-- you're the-- you're the line manager. You're the line manager so you would know where the line is.

#### HARTRO

Yes, yes, I manage the line.

#### SIGMUND

You manage the lines.

#### HARTRO

Exactly. Exactly.

#### SIGMUND

So, you wouldn't--

#### HARTRO

I mean, I'm not mincing words here.

#### SIGMUND

No.

#### HARTRO

I-I draw the line. I draw it in front of fraternising. I draw it, you know, *through* fraternising.

#### SIGMUND

Okay.

#### HARTRO

I mean, friend, I say friend, I say, you know, friend or foe, really. Hartro, friend or foe? I don't know. They're always guessing. Always wondering. The shapeshifter.

#### SIGMUND

Okay.

#### HARTRO

You're looking-- Yes.

#### SIGMUND

Okay.

#### HARTRO

Finished with-- Do you want me to--?

#### SIGMUND

Not unless there's anything you'd like to say on that topic.

#### HARTRO

Just that I'm a shapeshifter--

#### SIGMUND

You're a shapeshifter.

#### HARTRO

--and I have a line that I draw. And it goes *through* friends.

#### SIGMUND

Okay, a line-drawing shapeshifter with no friends. That's Hartro Piltz. Okay, and would you ever defy the Board? __[sound of large and threatening gun unfolding, low tone beeping]__ Would you ever defy the Board?

#### HARTRO

Sor-- No!

#### SIGMUND

No? You would never consider defying the Board?

#### HARTRO

I-I don't think I've even heard the words "defy the Board" in the same sen-- I can't believe I've just uttered them, you know. I've uttered them as something I would draw a line through. There, you've-- I've done it, see? [__SIGMUND:__ So, are you--] That's-- that's me at work right there.

#### SIGMUND

In your role as shapeshifting line-drawer, [__HARTRO:__ Yes.] you're-- you're drawing a line through defying the board?

##### [gun makes adjustments]

#### HARTRO

Through defying the Board, yes.

#### SIGMUND

To say "no, I would not".

#### HARTRO

To say absolutely not. Absolutely not.

#### SIGMUND

Okay, wonderful. __[beeping stops, gun disassembles and retracts]__ Let's move on then. So, um--

#### HARTRO

I just--

#### SIGMUND

--you have-- Sorry.

#### HARTRO

I even sing-- I sing the Board song every morning. I didn't-- You didn't let me carry on. It's fine, no, I understand. I mean, you-- you're-- you're in charge here. [__SIGMUND:__ Mm-hmm.] Uh, but, in my-- in my perfect day, I-- after I, uh, get Shelled I also sing the Board anthem. I...

#### SIGMUND

So, you have an almost *exemplary* record of-- of both planet delivery and customer satisfaction.

#### HARTRO

Sorry, I didn't hear-- What-- Sorry?

#### SIGMUND

You have an *almost* exemplary record of--

#### HARTRO

Exemplary, yes.

#### SIGMUND

--of both planet delivery and customer satisfaction. So, how do you account for that--

#### HARTRO

Thank you. __[laughs]__

#### SIGMUND

--*almost* complete success?

#### HARTRO

I-- Complete success. I-- every-- that's what I--

#### SIGMUND

Sorry, sorry, *almost* complete-- Sorry, I just want to make sure that point is-- is held that you have an almost exemplary record.

#### HARTRO

Is-- Isn't that funny though. Isn't that funny. Uh... __[laughs]__ I just think, you know, when you are creating a masterpiece, don't you, the artist, also create the imperfection within the masterpiece so as to have your audience see where the true beauty is and be reminded of what they are seeing? How-- how is one to know what masterpiece and beauty is if they do not have anything to compare it to? I mean, I would say the point zero two five percent (0.025%) of my non-complete perfect record is just that small fissure of an arrow pointing at the beauty of my work.

#### SIGMUND

So, you specifically choose to engineer failure in part of your work to cast more glory onto the rest of it, is that what you're saying to me?

##### [sound of large and threatening gun unfolding, low tone beeping]

#### HARTRO

No.

#### SIGMUND

Ah. So, what *are* you saying, Hartro?

#### HARTRO

I'm-- what I'm saying-- what-- __[nervous chuckle]__ I'm glad you asked. I'm glad you asked. What I'm saying is... that sometimes you get given a piece of mud when you're trying to make a marble statue. And, what do you do? You have to mold it along with-- I mean, I-- I've been given my materials, haven't I, and one of my materials, we won't mention names, _(under breath)_ *Trexel Geistman*, is really difficult to work with and I-- I'm not saying it's a problem. Board knows it is not a problem; it is just something that makes my, you know, skills develop even more. It's a blessing.

#### SIGMUND

A blessing.

#### HARTRO

It is a blessing.

#### SIGMUND

A blessing from the Board.

#### HARTRO

Yes.

#### SIGMUND

Hail the Board.

##### [beeping stops, gun disassembles and retracts]

#### HARTRO

Hail the-- hail the Board.

#### SIGMUND

After a hard day [__HARTRO:__ Mm.] of managing your lines, how do you like to unwind?

#### HARTRO

Well, funny-- funny Sigmund, uh, uh, there's no such thing as a hard day. There just really isn't. I mean, I unwind like everyone else. Eh, you know, I, uh, I have ion scrubs but that's just to, you know, keep my appearance, uh, sharp and shapely. Uh, you know, I've-- I've been known to un-- unwind with a bit of slurry in the evening, you know. Uh, like anyone, like anyone.

#### SIGMUND

We all love our slurry.

#### HARTRO

Ah. Yea-- But really, there's no need for it, it's just, I'm social. I'm a social animal. I'm so popular amongst the managers and the lines and the-- and the parties, and... __[trails off]__

#### SIGMUND

Do you party?

#### HARTRO

I will put on a facade of party if I must.

#### SIGMUND

Because, obviously the Board really encourages our line managers to sometimes, you know, get out there and let down their hair. So, you're saying that you, you buck against that enjoyment and you-- and you push against the mandated parties of the Board?

##### [sound of large and threatening gun unfolding, low tone beeping]

#### HARTRO

I didn't understand that question the first time around. Isn't that funny? Um... I-- you know what? I think it's the heat. It is the heat.

#### SIGMUND

Oh, is it-- is it a little hot in here for you?

#### HARTRO

_(crosstalk)_ It's a little hot, Sigmund.

#### SIGMUND

_(crosstalk)_ I'll just turn it up.

##### [knob being turned, heater fans blowing]

#### HARTRO

And you are-- you are a very appealing looking man. __[nervous laugh]__ Uh-- Um-- I party! I love party-- Would you like to party? I think we should party.

#### SIGMUND

Hartro, we're-- we're recording an interview so I-- I don't think I'll-- I'll take up the partying. But the fact that you offered is-- is noted. __[beeping stops, gun disassembles and retracts]__ So, sometimes you have to make tough calls in your job. So, how do you feel it's best to tell a consultant that, unfortunately, their employment, and indeed their life, is going to be terminated?

#### HARTRO

Well, Sigmund, uh, I know you must also feel the responsibility in your job. As I've been travelling up the different prestigious stages in Stellar Firma and I've now become a line manager, I know that there are some things I have to do and that can be hard but I signed up for the job. I can do it. I'm... I'm not afraid to really get into the minds of my disciples, ha, children, ha, colleagues, what have you. Uh, I tell it like it is. You know, I don't like to really mince words and I definitely don't want to torture anyone. Just really let them know as kindly as possible. You know, if there's a way to avoid it, I will.

#### SIGMUND

So, you would go against an execution order?

##### [sound of large and threatening gun unfolding, low tone beeping]

#### HARTRO

We-- Oh, we were talking specifically dead-- Ah, no. Ah, n-no! No, no. If-- if there is an order to execute someone, I mean, give me the-- give me the gun. I would be happy to. I mean, I would do that if I needed to. Uh, I don't even think you need to inform the person, just __[makes gun cocking noise]__.

#### SIGMUND

Just out behind them and-- Hm.

#### HARTRO

I mean, if the-- if the Board has--

#### SIGMUND

_(crosstalk)_ In the night?

#### HARTRO

_(crosstalk)_ If the Board has--

#### SIGMUND

In the night while they're sleeping? When their back is turned or eyes are closed? Let's say it's your oldest friend. __[gun makes adjustments]__ And-- and you were called to a-- a secret tribunal and-- and were told they had to be removed and terminated and we handed you the gun and said, "do it now". Would you immediately walk to that person's pod, quietly open the door, creep up, pull back the covers, and take them out?

##### [gun makes adjustments]

#### HARTRO

And this is-- this is an execution order by the Board? This is... __[gun makes adjustments]__ Well, Sigmund, it's funny that you are asking me this because... we know the answer, don't we? Of course we do.

#### SIGMUND

What's the answer, Hartro?

#### HARTRO

Well, I would like to just say, of course you would do the same as me. Yep.

#### SIGMUND

And what would I do, Hartro?

#### HARTRO

What would you do, Sigmund? How many times have you ever been asked a question?

##### [gun makes adjustments]

#### SIGMUND

How many--

#### HARTRO

I mean, you're looking at me as if you've never been asked a question before in your life about anything. Ha ha ha ha! But have you been asked a question like, "what would you do?"

#### SIGMUND

Yes. Many times. And my answer has always been "yes".

#### HARTRO

And that is mine as well. That's what I was saying. Well done, us. __[Sigmund exhales]__ I think, you know, we're very similar... _(sounding unsure)_ you and I. Very...

#### SIGMUND

Would you ever defy the Board?

##### [gun makes adjustments]

#### HARTRO 

_(quickly)_ No.

#### SIGMUND

Never thought about defying the Board?

#### HARTRO

I feel like you might have asked that before.

#### SIGMUND

We just like to check.

#### HARTRO

Okay.

##### [beeping stops, gun disassembles and retracts]

#### SIGMUND

What's next for Hartro Piltz?

#### HARTRO

Not defying the Board. I meah, uh, yes. Moving on. Uh, Stellar Firma has given me such a *prestigious* position and I can only hope that with my *fantastic* record that you pointed out earlier--

#### SIGMUND

Almost exemplary.

#### HARTRO

With that exemplariness, I just think they would want me to move forward and up and onwards and the sky is the limit. Ha, I hate to, you know, use a clichÃ© but, really, it is for me. Just work. Work, work, work.

#### SIGMUND

Wonderful. Well, Hartro, just one final question [__HARTRO:__ Yes.] before we let you go.

#### HARTRO

Oh, really, only one more?

#### SIGMUND

Just the one. Would you ever defy the Board?

##### [sound of large and threatening gun unfolding, low tone beeping]

#### HARTRO

No.

##### [beeping stops, gun disassembles and retracts]

#### SIGMUND

Hartro Piltz, thank you very much. And thanks to all of you for joining me, Sigmund Shankeray, _(the show sounds like it is being played on a radio in a corridor)_ on this edition of Executive Quarterly. I hope you'll join me next week where we're meeting Gamma Delt, the most compliant and obedient young executive I've met in many aeons. Thank you.
