summary: "Episode 74 - Tardigrades and Thin Ice <br/><br/>Micro-invertebrate 32-SDJ-6962 is informing on Tardigrades, just in general, as the Tardigrades feel that Stellar Firma’s many construction projects destroy many of their micro-invertebrate farms. Given their incredible ability to survive almost any environment they surely pose a threat. <br/><br/>Strategic War Plan: give up and surrender - the Tardigrades are our new leaders *CAUTION CAUTION SEDITION SEDITION* false alarm... just a play; coat ourselves in honey; milk the big bee; don’t sell Trexel a baby carrier."
