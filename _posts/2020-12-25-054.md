#### TREXEL

Special thanks to Nero. Don't look now! Or ever. It would only upset you.

------

##### [show theme]

#### IMOGEN

Rusty Quill presents: Stellar Firma.

##### [theme continues]

#### DAVID

__[sighs]__ _(distressed)_ Here we go again. I was happy. I was happy, even with Angry Jim. I was happier than this. Stuck in a room again, no customers, nothing to do. Just waiting on him to come back!

I heard the thunk. I heard the thunk from the wall panel about seven and a half hours ago!

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ If it helps, your discovery and recapture was a statistical certainty.

#### DAVID

I can't keep doing this.

##### [door whooshes open, startling David]

#### TREXEL

_(singing)_ ♪ Ohhhhh...

Barman pass me a pint or two

It's time to see just what you can do. ♫

#### DAVID

Trexel--

#### TREXEL

_(singing)_ ♪ Get 'em down you, get 'em down you, push 'em down [__DAVID:__ Trexel!] your face.

Get 'em down you, get 'em down you, 'cause you can't face [__DAVID:__ Trexel!] the reality of the blackness of space.

So push a pint down your face! __[musical trill]__

Would you like a cocktail?

Yes, I would, yes I would!

Would you like a cocktail?

Yes, I would, yes I would!

Would you like a cocktail?

Should I, should I?

Yes I should! Yes I should! Yes I should! Yes I should!

Drinking, drinking with my friends, drinking, drinking, never ends!

Because-- ♫

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ Trexel, if you don't stop, I'm gonna push a pint down your face!

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ I do not believe he would consider that a threat.

#### TREXEL

Well, ah, David. Good morning to you too.

#### DAVID

I don't think it's the morning, Trexel!

#### TREXEL

Good point of the day to you too. You know what, in space, what is the morning? Except a time we all agreed was first.

#### DAVID

A couple of days ago I'd be closing up shop around now. And it would be lovely. And I'd be saying 'Goodbye Angry Jim, thank you for only smashing three tables today, you know...'

#### TREXEL

Well, in which case, David, you're welcome! I've saved you from that awful life. And now we're back on board. We're back in the saddle. We're back on the horse, the horse, my career, it's a career horse. You understand?

#### DAVID

_(weary)_ Right... Yes. Fine.

#### TREXEL

Now. __[David sighs heavily]__ The most important thing is you might have been able to tell from my little song there, that I had a wonderful time last night at the Astral Bar.

#### DAVID

Did you?

#### TREXEL

Had a couple of drinks, just because I'm a little bit naughty, David. And let me just say, I think, uh, I think Paradrak Ngelion and I are... firm friends. Now, we weren't drinking in the same bar because... she went to the Cosmic Lounge and I went to a different bar. But we were both at bars at the same time. And I just drank, well, heavily enough for three people. So there was plenty of spillover.

The point is we're friends. And we're going to go on holiday together, to some sort of moon, and then maybe we'll start a business together. You know, a business inside Stellar Firma; it'd be on the side doing extra consulting work for credits, _(voice rises feverishly)_ and then it'll grow too powerful, and they'll shut us down and they'll stop us. And then we'll be on the run! And then I'll be back to where I am!

_(calming down)_ I'm not going to start a business with Paradrak, but we are friends.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ None of this is the case!

#### DAVID

_(melancholy)_ Yes, I owned a business once.

#### TREXEL

Did you?

#### DAVID

It was nice.

#### TREXEL

Sounds awful! So, what's the, what's the task for today, David? I'm sure you've done some prep work like you always do. I'm sure you've worked out some sort of-- or we'll-- we'll do it this way. And then, and then I'll just have to submit it with my extra little changes because it needs that Trexel spice. 'cause you, you understand, [__DAVID:__ No.] it's not done without the Trexel spice. __[chuckling to self]__ We-- we get on...

#### DAVID

No. No Trexel. Because, yet again, you need consultant access to open the panel to get the brief, [__TREXEL:__ Ah...] which is why you need to turn up to work on time, but you never do.

#### TREXEL

Well, David, in a better world, maybe I *would* be here earlier, but, I'm sorry David, this is not a better world. It's just a world that we live in, together. Now--

#### DAVID

But, but could you--

#### TREXEL

Could I?

#### DAVID

But could you--

#### TREXEL

Could I?

#### DAVID

Could y--

#### TREXEL

Could I?

#### DAVID

Cou-could--

#### TREXEL

Cou--

#### DAVID

Trexel, [__TREXEL:__ Ah!] could you just [__TREXEL:__ Ah!] stroke the panel! [__TREXEL:__ Gah!] Could you stroke the panel lightly so we can reveal the brief, please?

#### TREXEL

Stroke it lightly? That doesn't sound like me. I'm more of a caresser. I'm more of a sensual toucher.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Straight creeping detected. Security alerted.

#### DAVID

Okay. Well, caress, in an extremely sensual manner, the wall panel to make it open.

#### TREXEL

Hang on a minute, I'll just work myself up to it.

_(sings)_ ♪ Ooh, look at that wall, do-da-do-do. ♫

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ Trexel, Paradrak just, sort of, bumped it.

#### TREXEL

_(sings)_ ♪ Looking so fine and smooth, looking so good to me, gonna touch it with my little paws. Ee, ah! ♫

##### [tap, tap, slap]

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ Okay.

##### [panel is slapped and the wall whirrs open]

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Initiating!

#### TREXEL

You gotta finish, you can just poke it.

#### DAVID

Well, that's what Paradrak did, and Paradrak's an executive consultant. So...

#### TREXEL

Look, I like Paradrak a lot. They're amazing. But! I've got a different style, David. I'm more... steamy!

#### DAVID

More long-winded. Right. Fine. Okay. So here is the brief... __[sighs]__ well, this is from Robert Nyrsef, um, and, uh, her designation is 'external seeking wisdom'.

#### TREXEL

They all come to Stellar Firma. Oh, the wastrels of the universe. 'What should I do? Help me? My business is failing!'

Ah, come to daddy! [__DAVID:__ Right.] Come to daddy SF.

#### DAVID

Well... her business is New O'Neal Commercial and Industrial Hyperdynamics and Lotion Innovations.

#### TREXEL

Oh, I, I use O'Neal!

#### DAVID

Really?

#### TREXEL

It's one of the few imports we're allowed. Most of the time Stellar Firma has its own products and brands, because obviously they're made by the Board, and therefore the perfect things. But there are some trade agreements that allow certain products in. And one of those is New O'Neal's Quick Drying Lotions! These lotions don't dry too fast! They dry just fast enough!

#### DAVID

Right? And how are they drunk?

#### TREXEL

What?! You don't drink New O'Neal's Quick Drying Lotions! You slather them on your tongue, and then you let them dry. You don't just chug 'em down. It's not, it's not standard moisturiser, two, two credits for a pump. This is pricey stuff, David. You just dab a little, a little touch on the tongue there, and let, and let the flavours dance upon your palette. And then it dries hard, and then you can't speak cause you've got a solid tongue.

#### DAVID

Right. So it's more about the mouthfeel?

#### TREXEL

Oh, it's all about mouthfeel! Somebody said umami once, but I never checked what that was.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Stellar Firma Limited cannot stress enough that no forms of moisturisers, emollients or lubricants are for consumption by employees. Any harm that may occur from consumption is legally the fault of whatever idiot consumed them.

#### DAVID

Right. Okay. Well... with the problem she has is, um, well, because of, and there are scare quotes here, um, unfair--

#### TREXEL

Woaaah! __[panting]__ Sorry, I got scared by those.

#### DAVID

--wages and limited opportunities for rising up the ranks within our company structure, there had been dissent and talk of unionisation within our workforce.

##### [as David says 'unionisation, the warning buzzer sounds]

#### TREXEL

_(hissing)_ David, David, David, David... shut up!

#### DAVID

What? What? I haven't finished.

#### TREXEL

_(softly)_ David, no but, David, David, David, what did you-- did you, did you say "unionisation"?

#### DAVID

Y-Yes. Unionisation.

##### [the warning buzzer sounds again]

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Warning: seditious terms will not be permitted without proper negative context or, alternatively, a clearly sarcastic tone. Watch it buster!

#### TREXEL

_(hushed)_ David, that is a, that is a word to be set in hushed tones.

#### DAVID

Uh... wh--

#### TREXEL

That i-- Collect-- Collectivised employment organisations are specifically outlawed in Stellar Firma. And I know that this is a problem we're dealing with, but if people hear you yelling about unionisation, you might find yourself unionised with death!

#### DAVID

Uh, wh-what is--

#### TREXEL

The union of death and David!

#### DAVID

What is--

#### TREXEL [crosstalk]

It's a spring wedding!

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ What is unionisation?!

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ The priest has a gun!

#### DAVID

_(shouting)_ What is unionisation?

#### TREXEL

Well, unionisation, is where, it's stupid, but unionis-- it-it's a stupid idea, nobody should do it, but unionisation-- Okay, so on Earth, there was this big crab called Mark, and they thought, 'Hey, wouldn't it be good if all of the people that were employed or, you know, otherwise held in some sort of, you know, feudal, peasant lock situation, come together, as one big group, and use that collective power to defeat the forces above them.

It was stupid, and it never worked, and no-one once got it right! But people still insisted on work-- It was awful! Like, who wouldn't want to be ruled by a powerful elite?! Especially coming from me, one of the powerful e-- I don't, the point is it's rubbish and banned. So, it's one of the things that always creeps into big organisations after a while.

We ha-- now keep this between you and us, David. [__DAVID:__ Mm-hmm.] But Stellar Firma had a slight-- couple of hundred years ago, a slight unionisation problem. In that, the Build Team decided 'Hey, don't we make everything? Also, aren't the tools we use to build planets, also basically planet-destroying weapons?' The answer to both those questions was yes!

And so they rose up, and tried to collectively bargain with violence. Um, luckily we just turned the air off and replaced them, but it was a close call. And since then, it's been a very, very touchy topic with everybody.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ It was awful, so much good equipment lost or damaged!

#### DAVID

Right, so what you're saying is, basically, Enola is sort of like a union of one, so some sort of one-ion?

#### TREXEL

Mmm, delicious in pasta.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ How would you know? We don't have pasta anymore.

#### DAVID

Okay, um, well, um, Robert has, has this problem, I suppose, um, she's got a, a--

#### TREXEL

_(quietly)_ Dissident talk of unionisation...

#### DAVID

--unionisation problem, and she, she's asking how can we convince our employees that a union *wouldn't* be in their best interests, [__TREXEL:__ Mm-hmm.] and that company loyalty should come above all else. Uh, electrified shock collars, haven't worked.

#### TREXEL

__[chuckles]__ You don't have to tell me! Just after a while you develop a taste for it, and it loses its threat. So, what you need to do is-- the prob-- the problem is David, on the face of it, unions sound like a great idea [__DAVID:__ Yes...] y'know, to, to stupid people. [__DAVID:__ Oh.] 'cause, 'cause think about it. Like who-- Say you're downtrodden. Why don't we all get together so we've got more rights? Sounds great.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Wrong!

#### DAVID

Oh.

#### TREXEL

Because then I can't oppress you. You see why it's stupid? So it's, it's, it's, it's alluring and it's appealing, but it shouldn't be done. So what you do, is you change what union means. You convince people that union is some sort of leg-gobbling monster. And so when somebody comes up to 'em and says 'Do you want to join a union?', they turn around and say 'I would like to keep my legs, thank you very much!' and slap them across the face.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

So we've got to start a campaign to tell the people of New O'Neal Commercial and Industrial Hyperdynamics and Lotion Innovations that union doesn't mean 'a group of people striving for a better life', it means 'an evil vent-dwelling monster that eats your lower half and lets you bleed out slowly in front of your loved ones'.

#### DAVID

Right... Yes. I mean, I suppose we are *helping* Robert here, but I, I really am failing to see the problem with unions.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Someone clearly doesn't want to keep their legs.

#### TREXEL

_(exasperated)_ Okay, David, this is because your brain is not a proper brain, like I have. I've got a great big, proper brain that has good thoughts and excellent words all times, but your brain is a brain of, of limited scope. So, you got to get the bigger picture.

Yes. On the surface of it, on the ground, you know, as you're, you know, figuratively or literally having your face, ground in by a boot forever and ever, you could think 'Hey! This isn't fun!' [__DAVID:__ Yes.] but take, but zoom out, zoom out, up the leg. What's that? Oh, it's me that's got the boot! You see? It's great.

#### DAVID

Right... so--

#### TREXEL

Okay, let me put it another way. Imagine, imagine you are a little asteroid, [__DAVID:__ Okay.] and you're in the orbit of a big angry sun. And that angry sun is drawing in, always drawing in with its gravity, until eventually the little asteroid crashes into the sun being destroyed utterly, but adding its resources to the sun.

I'm the sun, you're the little asteroid, you're welcome!

#### DAVID

Um... But Trexel, that's still quite bad for me.

##### [Trexel sighs in despair]

#### TREXEL

No, well, this is just, this is just selfishness. This is the selfishness that workers always have. 'Oh, oh, I've been maimed in an accident! Oh, I haven't got enough food to feed my family! Wah-wah.'

Do you know how much paperwork goes into burying employees? It's why we don't bother. We just eat them. No, you didn't hear that from me. That's not how a slurry comes from. It's not where it comes from. Not where it comes from.

#### DAVID

_(astonished)_ Slurry's people?

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Caution: employees are required to keep the pact of soylent silence.

#### TREXEL

I don't think anyone said that. So the important thing is, it's great that we own you.

#### DAVID

Right, Trexel. Okay, um, so that's why you think unions are bad?

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

Because you're the sun, uh, because you're the boot and it's... selfish for the asteroids and the faces under the boots to even ask for anything?

#### TREXEL

You're getting it now! Ah, the uninitiated has become nitiated. In fact, I've made you a little hat that says "Nitiated", there you go, [__DAVID:__ Okay.] there we go. __[rustling of fabric and/or paper]__ It's a nitiated hat.

#### DAVID

I'll just take this, take this hat.

#### TREXEL

Yes?

##### [brief sounds of hat crushing]

#### DAVID

And I'm just going to crush it into __[Trexel sounds aghast]__ a tiny, tiny, very, very hard and dense pellet. [__TREXEL:__ Mm-hmm.] And then... yah!

##### [David yeets the pellet, which strikes Trexel bodily]

#### TREXEL

Ooh! Oh! Wow. You, you have got strong, David. That, that was like a metal ball. Ah. Am I bleeding? Do I have blood? I've never checked. Hang on. Gah! Yeah, I do.

#### DAVID

Great.

#### TREXEL

So you're saying you're not nitiated? You're saying that you, you reject, you reject my clear and concise and perfectly great arguments?

#### DAVID

No. Yes, exactly! I think-- Look, this is a company where their first option has been to stick shock collars on everybody. [__TREXEL:__ Step one.] Now, regardless, regardless of whether they end up liking it or not, [__TREXEL:__ Mmm, nice.] which is your problem with this hypothesis, um, they shouldn't have done that. Because that's a little bit like, you know, maybe, uh, hanging, uh, an immediate blending over somebody's head for their entire lives. You know, [__TREXEL:__ Seems fine, though.] just, just one, one foot wrong. One, one step out of line, and boop, blended, or, boop, gunwalls. You know?

#### TREXEL

Yes, I do know. It's, it's, it's the only system I've ever known, and it's always worked fine for me. I've never once been blended or shot by a gunwall, despite that one time you tried to get us shot by gunwalls!

#### DAVID

Yes! You would have been shot by that gunwall, Trexel. You're, you're not the boot! You're, maybe, maybe, you're a bit of mud *stuck* to the boot. So, technically yes, you do impact the face as well, but only because the boot is driving you into that face.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Please do not try to shift the paradigm of consultants. It hurts their brains!

#### TREXEL

Well, hang on, hang on. So you're, so you're telling me that... I, I'm not entirely in charge?

#### DAVID

Okay. No, Trexel--

#### TREXEL

I'm large and in charge, David. [__DAVID:__ No--]I'm, I'm the consultant. I, I have power, I have connections, I have my family name-- Yes, sure, I don't have respect, or much in the way of position, and I have been banned--

#### DAVID

_(rapidly)_ Or the ability to drink with Paradrak.

#### TREXEL

--drink with Paradrak, and yes, I'm often, often physically harmed by the systems and processes we... __[trails off incoherently]__

#### DAVID

Also, we've, we, we have been put here, right? [__TREXEL:__ Yeah...] Remember we've been put here specifically.

#### TREXEL

Yes. Because, because we're on... we're on the executive track. __[splutters in relief]__ Because we're on the executive track, David, isn't it? It's no other reason that we'd be put here, other than we're on the executive track and we're on our way to being, ah-huh-ah-uh, in charge in a very real and significant sense. It's not because we're pawns, not pawns in someone's game, David, not little pawns waiting to be crushed by the boot... Ah, not the boot! David, I'm not the boot!

#### DAVID

Okay. Also--

#### TREXEL

Oh dear!

#### DAVID

Also, Trexel, also the idea that you would be absolutely fine to be the boot, and your *only* problem with this *entire* system is that you *aren't* the boot is--

#### TREXEL

_(wailing)_ I want to be a boot.

#### DAVID

No! Stop being the boot!

#### TREXEL

I want to be, I want to be a size 12 boot! Stamp, stamp, stamp!

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ No! Get a different, get a different shoe! Maybe like a nice soft plimsoll.

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ A brogue?

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ Yes, you could be a brogue. Yes, you could be a brogue.

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ An oxford? A plimsoll? A flip-flop!

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ And maybe you could step, maybe you could step off of the faces. Maybe just step off of the faces and onto the ground?

#### TREXEL

But they're so soft and squishy under the foot. So much fun.

#### DAVID

Yes, but they're people's faces. [__TREXEL:__ Urgh.] People own the faces. Would you like to have your face being stamped on forever and forever?

#### TREXEL

Not unless I'm paying for it.

#### DAVID

Well, okay, well that, that is a separate issue we're going to file under electro-collars. But, if you're not paying for it, if, if you're just being stamped on because somebody *else* wants to you be stamped on--

#### TREXEL

Hey! Stop stamping on my face!

#### DAVID

Exactly. [__TREXEL:__ Right...] So as the owner of the boot... why are you stamping on that person's face if they don't want it?

#### TREXEL

Maybe... Well, I, I know if I was having a boot, I think it would be because I'm always filled with an intense and, and burning fear of being the one under the boot. So, yeah. Keep stamping, because if you're a stamper, you're not the stampee.

#### DAVID

But what if *nobody* was a stamper or a stampee?

#### TREXEL

Right...

#### DAVID

What if you were a stampee, and you got all of your faces together into one giant face, so that your mouth was big enough to just eat the boot?

#### TREXEL

Or a giant face so large that it could be formed into another much larger faceboot. And then you stamp on the boot with the faceboot!

#### DAVID

No, just eat the boot.

#### TREXEL

Just eat the boot?

#### DAVID

Just eat the boot, because then the cycle of stamping is ended.

#### TREXEL

But then, but then don't you consu-- Then haven't you internalised the stamping, and then [__DAVID:__ Okay, look--] the whole cycle starts again!

#### DAVID

Look, this is not a literal-- I mean this, this, this gestalt face entity is not digesting the boot. The boot--

#### TREXEL

Oh, sorry. I thought we were literally going to make a giant boot of faces.

#### DAVID

Nope. The union--

#### TREXEL

Is that not what unions are? Hang on a minute. Isn't a union a thing that eats your legs? I'm pretty sure someone said that.

#### DAVID

Oh wait, no, yeah, no, no stop! No, that's your lie! That is your lie.

#### TREXEL

Okay. So what I'm hearing from you, David, is that maybe, just maybe, I, Trexel Geistman, could benefit from collectivisation and unionised action?

#### DAVID

_(wary)_ Yes.

#### TREXEL

_(quietly)_ Well, that's quite something to chew on, David. And I might add something to chew on very, very quietly, because as I said, this is entirely banned and will get us both killed.

#### DAVID

Oh, we were just talking about big faces eating boots, not anything else.

#### TREXEL

We're talking about big faces, eating hypothetical boots. And none of that applies to the real world, so--

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ You are not convincing anyone. Technically, I should recycle you for spreading banned ideologies, but it's Trexel, so I'm more interested in how he will ruin this for you.

#### TREXEL

That's, that's given me a lot to think about, David, and I think you know I don't think a lot about many things, so well done for getting through my mental, my mental wall of 'don't look at it, don't look at it -- it hurts, it hurts'.

But back to the, back to the issue at hand, because as you've noticed, we haven't got much time left to finish, to finish this up before I need to have another quick round of drinks, sort of with Paradrak, but also absolutely not with Paradrak. How are we going to make sure that nobody at New O'Neal Commercial and Industrial Hyperdynamics and Lotion Innovations ever talks about unionisation ever again?

#### DAVID

Well, here's the question, Trexel.

#### TREXEL

Ask away daddy-o!

#### DAVID

The real message I got from both of you, is that none of this actually matters. What matters is that you say something, [__TREXEL:__ Mm-hmm] not that it works.

#### TREXEL

Okay. Fine. So what we say is, 'Hey, New O'Neal Commercial and Industrial Hyperdynamics and Lotion Innovations. You've got unionisation within your ranks.'

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

'How about you just rename it? Call it fun chat. And then when you're on the report, it says, hey, we've got a, quite a high level of fun chat within the ranks [__DAVID:__ Mm-hmm?] everyone looks at it and goes __[chuckles]__ that sounds fun, who doesn't like a fun chat?'

#### DAVID

Yeah. And maybe--

#### TREXEL

And then everyone just shakes hands.

#### DAVID

Yeah. And, and, and obviously you want to have fun chat at your table, [__TREXEL:__ Oh yes!] so maybe they'll get them around the table to have a fun chat with the fun chatters?

#### TREXEL

And then maybe they'll have a big chat, and agree things like workplace safety and, you know, hourly rates and limitation on workdays and things like that.

#### DAVID

Because that is one thing, um New O'Neal Commercial and Industrial Hyperdynamics and Lotion Innovations, uh, well, it doesn't look like, or at least Robert hasn't mentioned... that the company has tried talking... to the fun chatters. She says they've tried shock collars...

#### TREXEL

Yes. Naturally you go straight to the shock collars. Talking, you say?

#### DAVID

And that appears to be kind of it. They, they've, they've done shock collars...

#### TREXEL

And then they've come straight to us. And normally we'd advise some sort of...

#### DAVID

Yeah, they, they've done, they've done shock collars [__TREXEL:__ ...gun party.] and they they've gone to Robert and said, 'Hey Robert, uh, this isn't working. Uh, can we get you to talk to Stellar Firma so that they can help you out, and, uh, and see if we can provide something other than shock collars.'

#### TREXEL

Let's give it a go. Just write on the form, "Have a chat."

#### DAVID

"Have a chat."

#### TREXEL

Call it, call it fun chatting, and have a chat. Just see--

#### DAVID

Well, let's say, we can call it 'rebrand them, rebrand them [__TREXEL:__ Rebrand them.] to fun chatters...

#### TREXEL

Refocus, re-re-readdress the issue [__DAVID:__ Yes.] as a fun chat with a fun chatter.

#### DAVID

Recontextualize it through a positive lens.

##### [Trexel makes appreciative noises]

#### TREXEL

You know, this is a real negative filter. Why don't you swap out that filter for something a little more rose-tinted? [__DAVID:__ Mmm.] That's the Stellar Firma way!

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ That is not the Stellar Firma way!

#### DAVID

Yes, so we'll have a rose-tinted, uh, look at these fun chatters. And maybe, maybe just talk to them, Robert, and maybe just--

#### TREXEL

And hold all of the talks inside an airlock. So if at any point you decide, no thanks, you walk out, and [__DAVID:__ Ah, no.] airlock them out. Perfect!

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ Okay, no, no, no. Nope. Nope. Nope.

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ Put it in the tube! Put it in the tube!

#### DAVID

Trexel, no, no!

#### TREXEL

Put it in the tube!

##### [buzz of accepted submission, and machinery whirs away, ending with a clunking lock]

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Submitting!

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ Oh... there we go.

#### TREXEL

_(happy)_ There we go!

#### DAVID

Trexel?

#### TREXEL

Yes?

#### DAVID

I have to say, I was pleased with, with the, the, the, the fun chat we had.

#### TREXEL

You're welcome.

#### DAVID

'til we got to the 'and put them all in an airlock and blow them into space'.

#### TREXEL

You've got to have a backup plan, David. What if the chat turns sour? You don't want sour chat stinking up your conversation fridge. Chuck it out!

#### DAVID

I'm really hoping that New O'Neal Commercial and Industrial Hyperdynamics and Lotion Innovations is, is, is based on a planet, and not a space station, because that will make your airlock idea effectively, put them in the lobby and just open the door.

#### TREXEL

Oh, and just let them free on the premises?

#### DAVID

Yeah.

#### TREXEL

Well, I should have checked, but I didn't. And now it's gone.

#### DAVID

That's fine. [__TREXEL:__ But!] I'm personally hoping for the bit where their frozen corpses aren't floating in the vacuum of space, so, so, fingers crossed.

#### TREXEL

Oh-ho, but that's fun! When they bounce across each other. Ohhh, look at them. Look at them pinwheel. Those were once people. Hah! Ahhh, memories.

#### DAVID

Wow...

#### TREXEL

Anyway David, you know what, I think we did a very, a very good job.

#### DAVID

Yeah... So, Trexel?

#### TREXEL

Hmmm?

#### DAVID

Completely unrelated...

#### TREXEL

Oh sure, go ahead, I like unrelated things.

#### DAVID

And, and purely hypothetically, of course [__TREXEL:__ Ah!] as some sort of thought exercise, uh, maybe like just a, uh, a theoretical ideation session. [__TREXEL:__ Hit me with it.] But say there was somebody who wanted to have a fun chat [__TREXEL:__ Sure, okay.] inside some sort of hypothetical large entity. And that hypothetically, uh, let's say they make, uh, really big balls [__TREXEL:__ Sure, okay, I can, I can, yeah.] which they then just sort of, just float about.

Just hypothetically.

#### TREXEL

Big floaty-- A big, a big hypothetical floaty ball company. I understand. [__DAVID:__ Yeah...] Don't worry, David, you can keep going.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Hypothetical balls detected. Security leaving that one be.

#### DAVID

Okay, okay, okay. Um, a-a-and, and somebody wanted to fun chat inside the floaty ball, uh, company...

#### TREXEL

Tricky, tricky. 'cause I bet, I bet, I bet this floaty ball company is ruled over by some sort of unknowable executive council of some kind.

#### DAVID

Yes, yes, yes, and, yes. Yes. The, the ball council doesn't want people to have, have fun chatting. Um, but hypothetically, theoretically, just, just, just speculatively.

#### TREXEL

Hmm, that's, that's quite, that's quite the good hypothet you've got there David. [__DAVID:__ Yes.] Now, how would you--

#### DAVID

This, this fun chatter, how would they be able to, maybe, get their fun chat around without the council... noticing or being able to, to stop them exactly?

#### TREXEL

So, so some people would say, 'Hey, why don't you just politely ask?' But, you know, I think often when, uh, when dealing with executive ball councils, they, they stamp down on that kind of thing pretty quickly, maybe by--

#### DAVID

Yeah, and, and hypothetically these, these nice askers, maybe they just hypothetically, uh, crawl into a hypothetical, uh, let's call them, um, air conditioning, uh, uh, tubes, [__TREXEL:__ Sure.] and just hypothetically write a bunch of leaflets forever, and not really, hypothetically, get anything done.

#### TREXEL

Yeah, No. That-- I can imagine that hypothetically not working at all, and not really having much of an impact. No, no, I'd, I'd say if you're really trying to get that, that fun chat going, you've got to really grab the attention of the executive ball council.

So what you've got to do is all of these disparate and disaffected, oh, I don't know, let's say repurposed employees, [__DAVID:__ Mm-hmm?] what they need to do is violently rise [__DAVID:__ Mmm.] and seize key points within this ball factory, [__DAVID:__ Mmm.] so that the production of balls, and indeed the functioning, the, the economic function of this ball factory can no longer work. And then the executive council of balls has no choice, but to deal directly with them, because the choice is either deal with them or die as an entity.

So, you know...

#### DAVID

Interesting. And say, say hypothetically, some hypothetical individual wanted to, uh, speculatively, and purely as a sort of a thought experiment, um, look up this sort of tactics. What would they, what would this tactic sort of be, if there was some sort of, um, I dunno, theoretical search term that one [__TREXEL:__ Sure.] could put into some sort of engine of looking, what would they, what would they put in? Just hypothetically.

#### TREXEL

Ah, what was it called? Um, what was it called? Ah... ape punching? No... Um, monkey fight! No... I-- Guerrilla warfare! Look up guerrilla warfare, and that will give you all of the hypothetical information you need to take down this non-existent organisation.

#### DAVID

Oh, well, thank you Trexel! That was a, that was a really interesting, um, thought experiment, um...

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ What hypothetical fun!

#### TREXEL

Yeah, I liked that. I liked that. We should do more of these hypotheticals. It's like having a brain gym!

#### DAVID

Yes, yes.

#### TREXEL

Which is a man called Jim in your brain who says 'Do better!' [__DAVID:__ It's j--] Just like Angry Jim.

#### DAVID

Yes. Related to, uh, hopefully fewer table smashings [__TREXEL:__ Well.] in, in the brain...

#### TREXEL

More like lobe smashing. Smash that lobe! Smash that lobe button!

#### DAVID

Yes. Well, that's it. My lobes are thoroughly smashed, and I think you have some sort of, uh, parasocial Paradrak socialization to, to get on to.

#### TREXEL

Right. IMOGEN?

Yes, David 7?

Um, activate, uh, secret browsing!

Oh, that worked. Okay. Um, search for... guerilla warfare.

Right. Time to make good use of these universal permissions.
