#### BEN

We're recording?

We're recording this--

Ahhhhhh. Watched pot never boils.

#### BEN

Sorry.

#### TIM

Yes, it was Friday review.

#### BEN

"Yes."

#### TIM

Monday.

#### BEN

"Yes."

#### TIM

Thanks, guys. I just had a sudden panic and I was gonna say it wrong. I apologise.

##### [Jenny laughs]

#### BEN

"Shall we just take that again?"

#### TIM

Let's just take that again.

#### BEN

"Okay."

#### JENNY

"Trexel, *what* are you doing?"

#### TIM

_(shouts)_ "I'm checking the days!!"

------

##### [transition beep]

#### BEN

"A massive, floating city."

#### TIM

"Airborne... air... horn?"

#### BEN

"Uh, a giant penis."

#### TIM

"Ooh! Just that." __[Ben bursts out laughing, coughs]__ I'm not sure, we're trying to keep the explicit rating off, aren't we?

#### BEN

That's fine. We can say 'penis'.

#### TIM

Do you want to say that one again, 'cause--?

#### BEN

It's mainly swearing.

#### TIM

_(laughing)_ Do you want to say--

#### BEN

Yes, I will, without laughing.

------

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

This is episode 3 of Stellar Firma Ltd. If anybody says we recorded a whole episode and Tim buggered up the mic channels, then they are a *filthy liar*.

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

"This isn't what I wanted, turning up, late in the day, head throbbing from one too many Flaxen Whis-iz. Was-i. What? Wait."

------

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

"A well-oiled cosmic greeting."

#### JENNY

"Yes. Well, when I'm done, you will be."

#### TIM

"I-- I look forward to being a well-oiled cosmic greeting, but-- but Trex-- But--"

#### JENNY

"Oh you **[long bleep]**."

#### TIM

"I said my own name."

#### JENNY

I'm sure you're not supposed to swear **[long bleep]**.

#### TIM

Right. __[hand clap marker]__ What-- what did I even want to say? __[all laugh]__ Hang on, when--

#### BEN

Tim--

#### JENNY

I think you wanted to say **[long bleep]**.

#### TIM

Uh, right.

#### JENNY

County **[bleep]**.

#### TIM

"I got-- I've won the county **[bleep]** cup!" Um.

##### [Tim and Ben laugh]

#### JENNY

Can we start over? 'Cause you didn't turn on the thing either.

#### TIM

I didn't turn on the-- Yeah, let's do that all again.

#### BEN

Okay.

#### TIM

But I will--

#### BEN

Burn it to the ground!

#### TIM

Burn it to the ground!

#### BEN

Build it again.

##### [Ben makes an explosion noise]

#### TIM

Last 6 minutes __[bleep, hand clap marker]__ Right. I'm gonna start-- I didn't start the timer. I didn't do anything but we're doing basically exactly that 'cause that was a lot of fun.

#### BEN

Basically, me and Jenny are just great.

#### TIM

Yeah. __[chuckles]__ You're okay.

#### BEN

Just doing very well.

#### TIM

Right, let's start-- let's just--

#### BEN

Well done us.

#### TIM

Yeah. Tim on the other hand. Look--

#### JENNY

I don't know if I like 'cosmic greeting' though. What the hell was that?

#### TIM

_(crosstalk)_ Cosmic-- I did repeat that because of a certain amount of-- __[Ben and Jenny laugh]__ I beg your pardon? __[all laugh]__

#### JENNY

You know.

#### TIM

You know, a cosm-- a well-oiled cosmic greeting.

#### BEN

Which is, of course, as we know, *blehblehblehbleh!*

##### [all break out laughing]

##### [transition beep]

#### BEN and TIM

_(steadily increasing in volume)_ Good Greg's a good egg. Good Greg's a good egg. Good Greg's a good egg. Good Greg's a good egg.

#### TIM

Good--

#### BEN

You know that Greg? He's a good egg! __[mouth stretching noises, gasping]__

#### TIM

_(quickly singing)_ ♪ Look at that man, it's Greg coming down! Good egg man, good egg town! Giving out eggs to all the people! Look at them, they are so feeble! They are weak from lack of protein! ♫

#### BEN

__[laughs]__ You've had caffeine, haven't you?

#### TIM

_(at the top of his lungs)_ *Wahoo!!!* Yeah!!!

#### BEN

Do you know what? I think we might be warmed up now.

------

##### [transition beep]

#### BEN

"Mmmm."

#### TIM

"It was-- You know when you-- when you're looking at a couple of planets in a line-up, maybe because a planet's committed a crime or something. And you're looking between them and you're like, '__[scoffs]__ These all look the same.' And then you get accused of being a racist. And then somebody says, 'Planets aren't a race!' And you're like, 'Ha ha!' You see?"

#### BEN

"I... do see."

#### TIM

Do we want to keep that? __[laughs]__

#### BEN

Yeeee-- Maybe?

#### TIM

I don't think so! __[laughs]__ I don't want to--

#### BEN

_(crosstalk)_ It's kind of funny, but a bit dodgy...

#### TIM

It's a bit dodgy. Okay.

##### [transition beep]

#### BEN

"Ever noticed how much they're being--"

#### TIM

_(crosstalk)_ Hello, welcome to _(mispronounce)_ Elem-- __[laughs]__ Welcome to Elephant Firma.

#### BEN

__[laughs]__ Elephant Firma!

#### TIM 

_(droll sing-song)_ Oh, Elephant Firma.

#### BEN

Where elephants are really firm about things.

#### TIM

I'm an elephant, and I'm pretty sure that economic policy is not gonna work.

#### BEN 

_(droll sing-song)_ Elephant Firma.

------

##### [transition beep]

##### [hand clap marker]

#### BEN

And scene.

#### TIM

And sc-- and-- and-- and an absolute scene.

#### BEN

Ohmph. Umph. Ohmph. Umph. Ohmph.

#### TIM

Oh, a *quality* scene. Just gonna pause this here.

------

##### [transition beep]

#### BEN 

_(as David as Trexel)_ "Ugh, I'm so drunk. And there's only 20 minutes left of the day. But that's fine. David will do design--" __[bursts out laughing, both laugh through the rest of the segment]__

#### BEN

Tim's face! I'm just--

#### TIM

I'm doing acting, Ben.

#### BEN

I know. But you were just **[bleep]**.

#### TIM

_(crosstalk)_ I'm doing the acting! I'm doing the acting!

#### BEN

I know! It's just-- the look of murder in your eyes.

#### TIM

It's alright.

#### BEN

I just--

#### TIM

"**[bleep]**-ing what?"

##### [Jenny joins the laughing]

#### BEN

I just-- I just made eye contact and thought about what you might say in response, and just lost it.

##### [Tim, Jenny, and Ben sigh]

------

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

Um, so, it's Stellar Firma episode 8. It's nearly 10 o'clock at night, and we've had a few drinks, and things are starting to unravel, so this is gonna be our last--

#### BEN

Starting?

#### TIM

Starting? Start-- Yeah, yeah. Like, we're-- up-- up top of the show: big tight ball of yarn. Now it's like a big cat's moved it around. __[pause]__ You look like you were going to say something. __[chuckles]__ Now he's just shaking his-- Ben, don't lose your words. This is an audio format. No, you-- That's a very lovely face, but that's not how... audio works. Um, so we're doing Stellar Firma episode 8. I'm going to do the clap with the sound first [__BEN:__ Good.] 'cause I always forget. Let's do that now.

##### [hand clap marker]

------

##### [transition beep]

#### BEN

__[yawns]__ Having a bit of a yawn. That's fine. __[Tim yawns]__ Hey, I've passed it on.

#### TIM

Having a little bit of a yawn.

#### BEN

Oh, no. Let's not get into a yawn loop. They died of yawning.

#### TIM

It's the witching hour.

------

##### [transition beep]

#### JENNY

"That sounded like you were gonna go into a story so I just thought I would keep talking. Uh, bouj-- bijou-- Ugh.

#### BEN

Boujou. __[bleep]__

Uh, bonjour planet!

#### TIM

Oh, bonjour planet!

##### [transition beep]

#### JENNY

"Mmmm..."

"We went for bioluminescent--" Blah blah blah. Sorry. __[Tim laughs]__ I just went "biolumnes--"

#### JENNY

Lum-lum...

#### TIM

Woah. So we're from--

#### BEN

_(mispronounce)_ Biolunsceour.

#### JENNY

Bonjour. Bonjour.

#### TIM

We'll go from 'we went for--'

#### BEN

Bonjour algae. 

##### [Jenny laughs]

#### TIM

I'm not-- The timer!

------

__[transition beep]__

#### TIM

"I remember the art justicar actually reviewed one of my planets. __[chuckles]__ The review just read _(shouting)_ '*Why?!'*"

##### [long beat]

##### [all laugh]

#### TIM

We're silent. No, no--

#### JENNY

Why?!

------

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

"Old Trexel Geistman over here with his-- with his brain like a bag of f-**[bleep]**." Uh.

#### BEN

*Woah!*

##### [Jenny laughs]

#### TIM

Uhh...

#### BEN

Trexel's gone blue.

#### JENNY

_(crosstalk)_ Old Trexel over here.

------

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

"Yes, we had a rocky start. You... tried to take me apart as a person but I feel we got through that, David, and we bonded. And as we bonded... we made beautiful love." No. __[Ben and Jenny start laughing]__ No, that will end badly. __[laughs]__ Okay--

#### BEN

You do it to yourself.

#### JENNY

Mm-hmm.

#### TIM

You do. __[singing, Jenny hums along]__ ♪ You and no one else! ♫

------

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

"I tell you why I was late. Now, this time it's a real doozy. I had a hand *neck* deep in the reactor core." ...I'm gonna do that again, my hand hasn't got a neck.

##### [all laugh]

#### BEN

Neck hand!

#### TIM

Neck hands.

#### BEN

Neck hands. There they go. Hand neck!

#### TIM

_(crosstalk)_ I was trying to think of the word elbow, and I came up with neck.

#### JENNY

So you go--

##### [Ben laughs]

------

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

The actual relationship is precisely like this. Also, Ben, stop stroking the table.

#### BEN

I-- Sorry, I just--

#### TIM

You love to stroke the table.

##### [table stroking noise]

#### BEN

I'm sorry.

#### TIM

This... this noise? This noise is not a fun noise for Ed. It's a bad noise for Ed.

#### BEN

Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

#### TIM

He likes to edit it out. He has so much fun doing that whilst we're also speaking.

#### BEN

Yes.

------

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

_(softly)_ And we fade out, Ed. And we fade out, Ed. Fade out, Ed.

#### BEN

The infinite blackness of space. __[Tim laughs]__

#### TIM

Oh, I-- Could I introduce you to the infinite blackness of space?

#### BEN

Oh, it's a black hole.

#### TIM

You know, I've often liked a star or an orb but, uh, most of all--

#### BEN

Stop recording. The podcast.

#### TIM

--I like the infinite blackness of spaaaaa--

------

##### [transition beep]

#### BEN

"Okay, so, why do you think it's so wet?"

#### TIM

"In space?"

#### BEN

"Yes."

#### TIM

"No, I-- Wait, I-- Which-- ooh-- Wait-ah-- Eh-- Oh-- __[extended grunting noise]__" Right, okay. I need to do something else than that. __[Ben laughs]__ Um, just gonna pause that.

------

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

"It's a very simple, simple logical, logical pattern."

#### BEN

"Right."

#### TIM

"It could be like water, but it's not like that. And therefore, why the h-**[bleep]** not?"

#### BEN

Um, you need to say 'heck'.

#### TIM

"Why the f-**[bleep]** not?"

##### [Ben sighs]

------

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

"It's a logical progression. Gas can be like fluids. Fluids aren't there. Gas isn't present in space, then why the heck couldn't it beh-- Couldn't a bah-- Couldn'tababa."

##### [Ben laughs]

#### TIM

F-**[bleep]**. Um, do I even like this tangent? __[laughs]__

------

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

"Jamerhall Back looks wantonly at the hump of her-- he, wah-- f-**[bleep]**." __[laughs]__ I went for something and it didn't quite work.

#### BEN

Okay.

#### TIM

Um...

------

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

Just interrupt me _(starts laughing)_ before I get too heavily into the maze.

#### BEN

_(laughing)_ Okay, I was like--

#### TIM

I was like, 'Please, I-- I haven't really got much...'

------

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

"I-- I actually have a manuscript here, something I've been working on. Okay."

#### BEN

"Ah-- well-- no--"

#### TIM

_(reading)_ "We open the fourth star-cark." What? Come on, Tim. __[Ben laughs]__ Come on. 'Star-cark?' Right, think about what you're gonna say because this is--

#### BEN

Uh, oh. We've dictionaried.

#### TIM

Oh.

#### BEN

Just say some stuff.

#### TIM

Yeah, no, no. But the thing is it needs to have some-- like the words need to-- they need to be actual words. The 'star-cark' isn't about anything, Ben. __[laughs]__

#### BEN

Okay. Well, just call the star-cock.

#### TIM

__[laughs]__ 'The star-cock.' Okay, now I've got something.

------

##### [transition beep]

#### BEN

"Okay, that's not an-- A: not an environment, B:I-- ca--" __[Tim laughs]__ I was going to go with 'Newton's not even a thing' but then that just-- ah, so many questions.

#### TIM

Yeah, because, like, we can still have Newtonian physics.

#### BEN

Yeah, exactly. I was just-- I was... digging for something that wasn't gonna...

#### TIM

__[laughs]__ I like the idea it's like, 'Everything's non-Newtonian! None-- none of the laws apply!'

------

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

"Consult Con. Destination: every single consultant on Stellar Firma." Destination? No, wait.

#### BEN

It didn't make any sense. __[laughs]__

------

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

"David, why do you feel like you're working through all this in real time?"

#### BEN

"Uhhhhhhhhh--" __[laughs]__

#### TIM

Sorry. I'm-- sorry, sorry. I was trying-- It was like, 'Uh, *because*...' __[laughs]__

#### BEN

"Yeah, 'cause I am."

#### TIM

No no no no no. It was my fault. It was my fault. It was my fault.

##### [Ben giggles]

------

##### [transition beep]

#### BEN

"And that means they are... really horny."

#### TIM 

_(crosstalk)_ "Ready to mingle." *Woah*, really horny? __[Ben collapses into laughter]__ Okay. Right. Can you say, 'and that means they're...' and I'm gonna interrupt you.

#### BEN 

_(weakly)_ Okay.

------

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

I'm just gonna put some lactose in my mouth now...

#### BEN

Yeah, I don't understand this. I mean, that's--

#### TIM 

_(muffled)_ I got some gummy.

#### BEN

That's cow's milk, as well.

#### TIM

Yeah, it's milk from a cow's teat!

#### BEN

Well, just use vegetable milk. Then you can still have milky teas and it's __[snorts]__ not gonna be lactose.

#### TIM

I wonder if oat milk would do that, or if that's sort of okay--

#### BEN

No, it's literally the lactose.

#### TIM

Yeah. _(softly)_ It's the lactose.

#### BEN

Well, I'm not an expert, but I'm pretty sure.

#### TIM

But, I'm an *eggs*pert.

#### BEN

But you only really... __[disappointed pause in response to Tim's joke]__ get milk throat... when you have milk.

#### TIM

_(laughing)_ I've got milk throat?

#### BEN

Well, no-- b-- I mean, you know what I mean. You've never heard of milk throat?

#### TIM

No!

#### BEN

You got a milky palate!

#### TIM

Oh, I've got-- __[chuckles]__ yeah, sure.

#### BEN 

_(gravelly voice)_ 'Old milky palate, my nemesis!'

#### TIM 

_(gravelly voice)_ 'Since you got that milk throat back at '83, you've been a menace. __[Tim and Ben make gurgling sounds]__ I can barely understand your news!'

#### BEN

Okay, we are being recorded... We're so very sorry, Alex.

#### TIM 

_(crosstalk)_ It's fine. We're only wasting our own time-- Oh, and also Alex's. __[laughs]__

#### BEN

Yeah.

#### TIM

He knows what the clap is.

#### BEN

_(crosstalk)_ This is literally paid time now.

#### TIM

He can skip!

------

__[transition beep]__

#### BEN

"We have about... 17 minutes left, so that's good that you're keen. Um, anyway--"

#### TIM

"Keen."

#### BEN

"The one f--"

#### TIM

"Keen. __[pause]__ Sorry, keep going."

#### BEN

"The one--"

#### TIM

"Keen. No, sorry, I-- I didn't mean to interrupt. Just keep going."

#### BEN 

__[breaks into laughter]__ Sonnuva b-**[bleep]**-tch.

##### [both laugh]

#### TIM

Alright--

#### BEN

We'll keep going with that, I just need to not break.

#### TIM

Okay. Right, we'll go fr--

#### BEN

Oh, it's funny 'cause I know you're gonna say keen...

#### TIM

We'll go from the "keen". We'll go from the first 'keen'. We'll go from the first 'keen'.

#### BEN 

_(still laughing)_ Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah I just need-- gimme a second.

#### TIM 

_(imitating)_ 'Gimme a second. Oh, hang on.'

#### BEN

'*Dah*ling.'

Why bother pausing it, Tim, we've got so much time to catch up on?

------

__[transition beep]__

#### BEN

"And how do you begin sex?"

#### TIM

"Well, when one being loves another being, or is-- is--" No, hang on, what do I want to say? __[breaks into laughter]__ Do we want to explain sex to David?

#### BEN

I'm taking us there.

#### TIM

Okay.

#### BEN

I want to hear Trexel explain--

#### TIM

Okay.

#### BEN

This is what the people want!

#### TIM

This is what they want. Okay.

#### BEN 

__[clapping for emphasis]__ Let! David! Say! F-**[bleep]**!

------

__[transition beep]__

#### BEN

Just tell me to shut up.

#### TIM

_(immediately)_ "Shut up, David! Shut up, shut up, shut up!"

#### BEN

...But wait for me to have a clean take--

#### TIM

"Shut up!"

#### BEN

#### BEN

"--incident."

#### TIM

"Yes! It's like a safe zone. Fill it with loads of nations, it's really difficult to decide who you want to kill."

#### BEN

"Exactly, sort of a Demilitarised Planet."

#### TIM

"Yes, yes, but they can't know it's a DMZ, because you know what they hate?"

#### BEN

It's a DMP.

#### TIM

Ah, f-**[bleep]** me. Also, I don't want to say this. This is-- this is nothing.

#### BEN

Okay.

##### [both laugh]

##### [transition beep]

#### BEN

"The one thing they've said is they hate *right* angles."

#### TIM

"Ah, it's got four, hasn't it?"

#### BEN

"Yes."

#### TIM

"I've got an idea. What happens when you glue two pyramids bottom to bottom together?"

#### BEN

"You *do* get rid of the right angles."

#### TIM

Nah, I've just realised you don't because--

#### BEN

Yeah, you do.

#### TIM

--there's no-- there's still a square. __[laughs]__

This isn't a good f-- Hang on. Wait. I know Trexel isn't supposed to have good ideas--

_(crosstalk)_ Look, what-- what-- what we're telling is that the Meredith brothers don't really know much about geometry.

#### TIM

"Oh, shapes! Shapes!"

#### TIM

"Let's make it a cone."

#### BEN

"Okay, right. Good and--"

#### TIM

"And also, cone sort of sounds like clone. I don't think that's anything, but I think we should note it." __[Ben and Tim laugh]__ No?

##### [both continue laughing]

#### BEN

No, I just-- I really wa-- Okay, no. I like it; I just didn't expect it. It was just--

And their foot's bleeding now. And then there's a-- there's a bit of a foot in my house! What am I gonna do with it then? What do I need-- I'm using it as a paperweight but it's starting to smell?"

##### [pause then Ben laughs]

#### TIM

Come on, Ben!

#### BEN

Come-- What?! Stop being so funny!

#### TIM

No! __[drawn out bleep]__ Okay, so, luckily, again, you held yourself for long enough that it was not--

#### BEN

Yeah, that's-- that-- literally, that's why I'm quiet. I'm s-- I'm trying to hold it in 'cause I don't want to ruin the take. __[sighs, hits something]__

#### TIM

Nearly there. 18 minutes, 23 seconds.

#### BEN

Just, again, did not expect you to go... there.

#### TIM [laughs]

I'm enjoying this.

#### BEN

Good, good, and I'm glad and it's fun. It's just--

#### TIM

Yeah. Alex, sorry, if in case you weren't noticing, these are good and they're __[bleep]__. Enjoy them. __[laughs]__ I've got a rotting fart of a foot as a paperweight.

#### BEN

Exactly! And you expected me to just *blast* right past that, did you?

#### TIM

Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah.

#### BEN

Oh, god.

#### TIM

Okay.

"Well, that's lucky because-- oop, boop-- there it goes. CLUNK! Hmm? I just-- sorry, I just--" __[fake cough]__

#### TIM

"You don't need to do the foley for it, David."

#### BEN

Uh, no that was-- that was David coughing.

#### TIM

Oh! Was that a cough?

#### BEN

_(crosstalk)_ To cover the clunk.

#### TIM

CLUNK!

#### BEN

Well, that was-- __[laughs]__ Yes, it was a *bad* cough.

#### TIM

A-CLUNK!

#### BEN

I mean-- no. Okay, I'll drop it.

#### TIM

Yeah.

#### BEN

I tried something; it didn't work. CLUNK!

#### TIM

__[laughs]__ Er-CLUNK! "David, I-- I noticed it *more* because you did that." __[both laugh]__ CLUNK! TUBE NOISE!

#### BEN

__[laughs]__ Nothing wrong! __[fake cough]__

#### TIM

It wasn't all like this but whenever you submit it, like, there is some foley but you always go 'blelelep!' __[both laugh]__ Blu-blop!

#### BEN

Boop-ba-boo-bop-boo!

#### TIM

Okay, okay, okay, we're so close to the end! We're so close to the end.

Fun one. __[shouting]__ "Oh, no!" __[laughs]__ Not that one.

#### BEN

__[laughing]__ That wasn't Trexel's voice.

##### [beep]

#### TIM

__[shouts again]__ Okay, that's enough. You can work-- you can work it out from those screams, I'm sure. __[Ben laughs]__ If you need another scream, let me know.

##### [transition beep]

#### BEN

"How about a government-mandated limited entertainment policy?"

#### TIM

"Oh, no, that wouldn't be good at all. Wait, sorry, no, that would be good. Sorry, I didn't mean to negate that. __[laughs]__ You try that line again and I'll have a different response."

##### [Ben snorts]

##### [transition beep]

#### BEN

"What about a government-mandated entertainment policy?"

#### TIM

"That's even better! Forget the transport stuff, that's b-**[bleep]**-s. That's a swear. __[both laugh]__ Try it all again! All of it again! Lock the doors! Shut your face! Let's do it again! Okay! Ha ha!"

"You're a complete... idiosyncratic... egotistical... maniac... Uh. Other words."

"Many people have tried to define me and it is difficult, yes." __[Ben chuckles, Tim laughs]__ Just laughing now?

#### BEN

Wha--? Oh, did I just let out a laugh?

#### TIM

You just la-- you just laughed. You just laughed. __[laughs]__

"Trexel, are you alright? Trexel? You're-- __[long bleep]__. Argh!"

Everyone is Trexel, apparently.

Everybody's Trexel.

#### BEN

Give the man a puppet and everyone in the world is Trexel.

#### TIM

Give a man a puppet, he'll bond with that puppet. Give him two puppets, puppet city. __[Ben laughs]__ You know, it just happens.

Oh, I feel sorry for Alex. This is just so much he's--

No.

#### TIM

--little vocal-- little mouthy warmups, and then we're going to do--

#### BEN

It's the first episode after the team-building exercise.

#### TIM

Team building. Sorry, I meant to say that. I thought team-review, and then said team-building exercise.

#### BEN

Nope. Other way around.

#### TIM

No. Gah. I am a protected category. __[Ben laughs]__ And, like an endangered--

#### BEN

Not for thinking!

#### TIM

Yep, absolutely. Dyslexia is all about thinking, ding-dong. Ha ha! __[screaming]__ "Ah ha! Finally! My victory is here!"

#### BEN

Damn it.

#### TIM

__[screeching]__ "Avant Geistman!" __[Ben laughs]__ Um, yeah. Yeah. So, uh, hi Alex. I'm officially dyslexic, so, any mistakes I make--

#### BEN

He's always been officially dyslexic. He's just making it a thing now.

#### TIM

I'm just making a thing now. I'm leaning into it. __[Ben scoffs]__ I'm-- I'm woke. Is that what that means? I don't think so. But-- Can you be woke about yourself about something you already knew but are now-- are now exploiting?

#### BEN

Yeah, yeah, exactly.

#### TIM

I suppose so.

#### BEN

Pretty sure you're un-woke at that point.

#### TIM

Yeah, look, it's all about me. __[Ben laughs]__ Look, I am the most, uh, derided member of society: the idiot. And we have our time now. We're in government now. We're in-- Some hot satire. Hot, hot satire. Hot sat--

#### BEN

_(crosstalk)_ That's very unfair to dyslexic people. Very, very unfair.

#### TIM

What, you mean, my people?

#### BEN

Yes, your people.

#### TIM

I speak for them all? __[laughs, Ben snorts]__ Every single one!

#### BEN

I-- I think Alex might *also* be dyslexic, so we'll let him get back to you on that one.

#### TIM

Yeah, well, you know, he's one of the splitters.__ [Ben laughs]__ He's one of the intelligents. Uh--

#### BEN

So, how's-- how's recording going, Tim?

#### TIM

How's record-- It's going real well.

#### BEN

Good.

#### TIM

Going real-- Costing Alex money every second-- __[laughs]__ Uhm--

#### BEN

That you insult him for.

#### TIM

And then I insult him for. Um, but you know what? He's knows that it's from this, uh, these humble beginnings-- the pots of, uh, pots of-- of hot humour do, uh, do boil and froth over into the cups of the waiting, uh, __[hungrily]__ people below. This froth and--

#### TIM

"Okay, great. So, we've got a lake of water, a lake of fire, a lake of air, a lake of *goo* for David, and also a freshly tilled lake of earth." __[Simon and Ben laugh]__ Was it 'freshly tilled'?

Stop the timer.

It's just funny. It's just a funny concept.

Okay. Alright. Fine. We will do this, come on.

"Two Three Four--" __[pause]__ The song.

Oh, that was-- that felt really wrong that we didn't actually do anything. Somebody said, 'two three four' and the song didn't start?
