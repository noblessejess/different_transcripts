##### [shorter version of the show theme]

##### [Ben and Tim doing vocal warm ups which sound like weird gurgling-- Ben has referred to this as "tongue bootcamp" in RQG]

#### TIM

We're recording. __[clears throat]__ And-- okay, let's do--

#### BEN

We're recording?

#### TIM

We're recording.

#### BEN

Why would you record this?!

##### [transition beep]

##### [Ben and Tim loudly sip their drinks]

#### BEN

Ahhhhhh. Watched pot never boils.

#### TIM

__[laughs]__ Okay. What were we gonna not make it really difficult?

#### BEN

Sorry.

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

Timeline-wise, this is Monday, right?

#### JENNY

Mm-hmm.

#### BEN

"Yes."

#### TIM

Yes, it was Friday review.

#### BEN

"Yes."

#### TIM

Monday.

#### BEN

"Yes."

#### TIM

Thanks, guys. I just had a sudden panic and I was gonna say it wrong. I apologise.

##### [laughs]

#### BEN

"Should we just take that again?"

#### TIM

Let's just take that again.

#### JENNY

"Trexel, *what* are you doing?"

#### TIM

__[shouts]__ "I'm checking the days!!"

##### [transition beep]

#### BEN

"A massive, floating city."

#### TIM

"Airborne... air... horn?"

#### BEN

"Uh, a giant penis."

#### TIM

"Ooh! Just that." __[Ben bursts out laughing]__ I'm not sure, we're trying to keep the explicit rating off, aren't we?

#### BEN

That's fine. We can say 'penis'.

#### TIM

Do you want to say that one again?

#### BEN

It's mainly swearing.

#### TIM

__[laughing]__ Do you want to say--

#### BEN

Yes, I will, without laughing.

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

This is episode 3 of Stellar Firma Ltd. If anybody says we recorded a whole episode and Tim buggered up the mic channels, then they are a *filthy liar*.

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

"This isn't what I wanted, turning up late in the day, head throbbing from one too many Flaxen Whis-iz. Was-i. What? Wait."

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

"A well-oiled cosmic greeting."

#### JENNY

"Yes. Well, when I'm done, you will be."

#### TIM

"I-- I look forward to being a well-oiled cosmic greeting, but-- but Trex--"

#### JENNY

"Oh you __[long bleep]__."

#### TIM

"I said my own name."

#### JENNY

I'm sure you're not supposed to swear__ [long bleep]__.

#### TIM

Right. __[hand clap marker]__ What, what did I even want to say? __[all laugh]__ Hang on, when--

#### BEN

Tim--

#### JENNY

I think you wanted to say __[long bleep]__.

#### TIM

Uh, right.

#### JENNY

County __[bleep]__.

#### TIM

"I got-- I've won the county __[bleep]__ cup." Um.

##### [Tim and Ben laugh]

#### JENNY

Can we start over? 'Cause you didn't turn on the thing either.

#### TIM

I didn't turn-- Let's do that all again.

#### BEN

Okay.

#### TIM

But I will--

#### BEN

Burn it to the ground!

#### TIM

Burn it to the ground!

#### BEN

Build it again.

##### [Ben makes an explosion noise]

#### TIM

Last 6 minutes __[bleep, hand clap marker]__ Right. I'm gonna start-- I didn't start the timer. I didn't do anything but we're doing basically exactly that 'cause that was a lot of fun.

#### BEN

Basically, me and Jenny are just great.

#### TIM

Yeah. __[chuckles]__ You're okay.

#### BEN

Just doing very well.

#### TIM

Right, let's start--

#### BEN

Well done us.

#### TIM

Yeah. Tim on the other hand.

#### JENNY

I don't know if I like 'cosmic greeting' though. What the hell was that?

#### TIM

Cosmic-- I did repeat that because of a certain amount of-- __[Ben and Jenny laugh]__ I beg your pardon? __[all laugh]__

#### JENNY

You know.

#### TIM

You know, a cosm-- a well-oiled cosmic greeting.

#### BEN

Which is, of course, as we know, *blehblehblehbleh!* __[all break out laughing]__

##### [transition beep]

__BEN and TIM: [steadily increasing in volume]__ Good Greg's a good egg. Good Greg's a good egg. Good Greg's a good egg. Good Greg's a good egg.

#### BEN

You know that Greg? He's a good egg! __[mouth stretching noises, gasping]__

#### TIM

__[quickly]__ You know that man, it's Greg coming down! Good egg man, good egg town! Giving out eggs to all the people! Look at them, they are so feeble! They are weak from lack of protein!

#### BEN

__[laughs]__ You've had caffeine, haven't you?

#### TIM

__[at the top of his lungs]__ *Wahoo!!!* Yeah!!!

#### BEN

Do you know what? I think we might be warmed up now.

##### [transition beep]

#### BEN

"Mmmm."

#### TIM

"It was-- You know when you-- when you're looking at a couple of planets in a line-up, maybe because a planet's committed a crime or something. And you're looking between them and you're like, 'these all look the same.' And then you get accused of being a racist. And then somebody says, 'planets aren't a race!' And you're like, 'Ha ha!' You see?"

#### BEN

"I... do see."

#### TIM

Do we want to keep that?__ [laughs]__

#### BEN

Yeeee-- Maybe?

#### TIM

I don't think so! __[laughs]__ I don't want--

#### BEN

It's kind of funny, but a bit dodgy...

#### TIM

It's a bit dodgy. Okay.

##### [transition beep]

#### BEN

_[crosstalk]_ "Ever noticed how much they're being--"

#### TIM

_[crosstalk]_ Hello, welcome to __[mispronounce]__ Elem-- __[laughs]__ Welcome to Elephant Firma.

#### BEN

__[laughs]__ Elephant Firma!

#### TIM [droll sing-song]

Elephant Firma.

#### BEN

Where elephants are really firm about things.

#### TIM

I'm an elephant, and I'm pretty sure that economic policy is not going to work.

#### BEN [droll sing-song]

Elephant Firma.

##### [transition beep]

##### [hand clap marker]

#### BEN

And: scene.

#### TIM

And-- and-- and, and an absolute scene.

#### BEN

Ohmph. Umph. Ohmph. Umph.

#### TIM

Oh, a *quality* scene. Just gonna pause this here.

##### [transition beep]

#### BEN [as David as Trexel]

"Ugh, I'm so drunk. And there's only 20 minutes left of the day. But that's fine. David will do design--" __[bursts out laughing, both laugh through the rest of the segment]__

#### BEN

Tim's face!

#### TIM

I'm doing acting, Ben.

#### BEN

I know. But you were just __[bleep]__.

#### TIM

I'm doing the acting, Ben! I'm doing the acting!

#### BEN

I know! It's just-- the look of murder in your eyes.

#### TIM

It's alright.

#### BEN

I just--

#### TIM

"__[bleep]__-ing what?"

##### [Jenny joins the laughing]

#### BEN

I just-- I just made eye contact and thought about what you might say in response, and just lost it.

##### [Tim, Jenny, and Ben sigh]

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

Um, so, it's Stellar Firma episode 8. It's nearly 10 o'clock at night and we've had a few drinks and things are starting to unravel, so this is going to be our last--

#### BEN

Starting?

#### TIM

Starting? Start-- Yeah, yeah. Like, we're-- up top of the show: big tight ball of yarn. Now it's like a big cat's moved it around. __[pause]__ You look like you were going to say something. __[chuckles]__ Now he's just shaking his-- Ben, don't lose your words. This is an audio format. No, you-- That's a very lovely face, but that's not how... audio works. Um, so we're doing Stellar Firma episode 8. I'm going to do the clap with the sound first [__BEN:__ Good.] 'cause I always forget. Let's do that now.

##### [hand clap marker]

##### [transition beep]

#### BEN

__[yawns]__ Having a bit of a yawn. That's fine.__ [Tim yawns]__

#### BEN

Hey, I passed it on.

#### TIM

Having a little bit of a yawn.

#### BEN

Oh, no. Let's not get into a yawn loop. __[Tim yawns]__ They died of yawning.

#### TIM

It's the witching hour.

##### [transition beep]

#### JENNY

"That sounded like you were going to go into a story so I just thought I would keep talking. Uh, bouj-- bijou-- Ugh.

#### BEN

Boujou. __[bleep]__

#### JENNY

Bonjour.

#### BEN

Bonjour.

#### JENNY

Bonjour.

##### [hand clap mark]

#### TIM

Oh, I also have to--

#### BEN [French accent]

Bonjour planet!

#### TIM

I also haven't done the time.

#### BEN

Uh, bonjour planet!

#### TIM

Oh, bonjour planet!

##### [transition beep]

#### JENNY

"Mmmm..."

#### BEN

"We went for bioluminescent--" Blah blah blah. Sorry.

##### [Tim laughs]

#### BEN

I just went "biolumnes--"

#### JENNY

Lum-lum...

#### TIM

Woah. So we're from--

#### BEN

__[mispronounce]__ Biolunsceour.

#### JENNY

Bonjour. Bonjour.

#### TIM

We'll go from 'we went for--'

#### BEN

Bonjour algae. __[Jenny laughs]__

#### TIM

I'm not-- the timer!

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

"I remember the art justicar actually reviewed one of my planets, ha. The review just read __[shouting]__ '*Why?!'*" __[long beat] [all laugh]__

#### TIM

We're silent. No, no--

#### JENNY

Why?!

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

"Old Trexel Geistman over here with his, with his brain like a bag of f-__[bleep]__." Uh.

#### BEN

*Woah!*

##### [Jenny laughs]

#### TIM

Uhh...

#### BEN

_[crosstalk]_ Trexel's gone blue.

#### JENNY

_[crosstalk]_ Old Trexel over here.

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

"Yes, we had a rocky start. You... tried to take me apart as a person but I feel we got through that, David, and we bonded. And as we bonded... we made beautiful love." No. No, that will end badly. __[Ben and Jenny start laughing, Tim joins in]__

#### BEN

You do it to yourself.

#### TIM

You do. __[singing]__ ♪ You and no one else! ♫

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

"I tell you why I was late. Now, this time it's a real doozy. I had a hand *neck* deep in the reactor core." ...I'm going to do that again; my hand hasn't got a neck. __[all laugh]__

#### BEN

Neck hand!

#### TIM

Neck hands.

#### BEN

_[crosstalk]_ Neck hands. There they go. Hand neck!

#### TIM

_[crosstalk]_ I was trying to think of the word elbow, and I came up with neck.

#### JENNY

So you go--

##### [Ben laughs]

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

The actual relationship is precisely like this. Also, Ben, stop stroking the table.

#### BEN

I-- sorry, I just--

#### TIM

You love to stroke the table. __[table stroking noise]__

#### BEN

I'm sorry.

#### TIM

This... this noise? This noise is not a fun noise for Ed. It's a bad noise for Ed.

#### BEN

Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

#### TIM

He likes to edit it out. He has so much fun doing that whilst we're also speaking.

#### BEN

Yes.

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

__[softly]__ And we fade out, Ed. And we fade out, Ed. Fade out, Ed.

#### BEN

The infinite blackness of space. __[Tim laughs]__

#### TIM

Oh, I-- Could I introduce you to the infinite blackness of space?

#### BEN

Oh, it's a black hole.

#### TIM

You know, I've often like a star or an orb but, uh, most of all--

#### BEN

Stop recording. The podcast.

#### TIM

--I like the infinite blackness of spaaaaa--

##### [transition beep]

#### BEN

"Okay, so, why do you think it's so wet?"

#### TIM

"In space?"

#### BEN

"Yes."

#### TIM

"No, I-- Wait, I-- Which I-- ooh-- Wait-ah-- Eh-- Oh-- __[extended grunting noise]__" Right, okay. I need to do something else than that. __[Ben laughs]__ Um, just gonna pause that.

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

"It's a very simple, simple logical, logical pattern."

#### BEN

"Right."

#### TIM

"It could be like water, but it's not like that. And therefore, why the h-__[bleep]__ not?"

#### BEN

Um, you need to say 'heck'.

#### TIM

"Why the f-__[bleep__] not?"

##### [Ben sighs]

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

"It's a logical progression. Gas can be like fluids. Fluids aren't there. Gas isn't present in space then why the heck couldn't it beh-- Couldn't a bah-- Couldn'tababa."

##### [Ben laughs]

#### TIM

F-__[bleep]__. Um, do I even like this tangent? __[laughs]__

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

"Jamerhall Back looks wantonly at the hump of her-- he, wah-- f-__[bleep]__." __[laughs]__ I went for something and it didn't quite work.

#### BEN

Okay.

#### TIM

Um...

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

Just interrupt me __[starts laughing]__ before I get too heavily into the maze.

#### BEN

__[laughing]__ Okay, I was like--

#### TIM

I was like, 'Please, I-- uh, I'm really on my sh--'

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

"I actually have a manuscript here, something I've been working on. Okay."

#### BEN

"Ah-- well-- no--"

#### TIM

__[reading]__ "We open the fourth star-cark." What? Come on, Tim. __[Ben laughs]__ Come on. 'Star-cark?' Right, think about what you're going to say because this is--

#### BEN

Uh, oh. We've diction read.

#### TIM

Oh.

#### BEN

Just say some stuff.

#### TIM

Yeah, no, no. But the thing is it needs to have some-- like the words need to-- they need to be actual words. The 'star-cark' isn't about anything, Ben. __[laughs]__

#### BEN

Okay. Well just call the star-cock.

#### TIM

__[laughs]__ 'The star-cock.' Okay, now I've got something.

##### [transition beep]

#### BEN

"Okay, that's not a-- A: not an environment, B:I-- ca--" __[Tim laughs]__ I was going to go with 'Newton's not even a thing' but then that just-- ah, so many questions.

#### TIM

Yeah, because, like, we can still have Newtonian physics.

#### BEN

Yeah, exactly. I was just-- I was... digging for something that wasn't gonna--

#### TIM

__[laughs]__ I like the idea it's like, 'Everything's non-Newtonian! None-- none of the laws apply!'

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

"Consult Con. Destination: Every single consultant on Stellar Firma." Destination? No, wait.

#### BEN

It didn't make any sense. __[laughs]__

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

"David, why do you feel like you're working through all this in real time?"

#### BEN

"Uhhhhhhhhh--" __[laughs]__

#### TIM

Sorry. Sorry, sorry. I was trying-- It was like, 'Uh, *because*....' __[laughs]__

#### BEN

"Yeah, because I am."

#### TIM

No no no no. It was my fault. It was my fault. It was my fault. __[Ben giggling]__

##### [transition beep]

#### BEN

"And that means they are..."

#### BEN [crosstalk]

"...really horny."

#### TIM [crosstalk]

"Ready to mingle." *Woah*, a little horny? __[Ben collapses into laughter]__ Right. Can you say, 'and that means they're,' and then I'm gonna interrupt you.

#### BEN [weakly]

Okay.

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

I'm just gonna put some lactose in my mouth now...

#### BEN

Yeah, I don't understand this. I mean, that's--

#### TIM [muffled]

I got some gummy.

#### BEN

That's cow's milk, as well.

#### TIM

Yeah, it's milk from a cow's teat!

#### BEN

Well, just use vegetable milk. Then you can still have milky teas and it's __[snorts]__ not gonna be lactose.

#### TIM

I wonder if oat milk would do that, or if that's--

#### BEN

No, it's literally the lactose.

#### TIM

Yeah. __[softly]__ It's the lactose.

#### BEN

Well, I'm not an expert, but I'm pretty sure. [__TIM:__ But, I'm an *eggs*pert.] Well you only really __[disappointed pause in response to Tim's joke]__ get milk throat... when you have milk.

#### TIM

__[laughing]__ I've got milk throat?

#### BEN

Well, look-- b-- I mean, you know what I mean. You've never heard of milk throat?

#### TIM

No!

#### BEN

You got a milky palate!

#### TIM

Oh, go-- yeah, sure.

#### BEN [gravelly voice]

'Old milky palate, my nemesis!'

#### TIM [gravelly voice]

'Since you got that milk throat back at '83, you've been a menace. __[Tim and Ben make gurgling sounds]__ I can barely understand your news!'

#### BEN

Okay, we are being recorded... we're so very sorry, Alex.

#### TIM [crosstalk]

We're really wasting our own time -- oh, and also Alex's. __[laughs]__ [__BEN:__ Yeah.] He knows what the clap is.

#### BEN

_[crosstalk]_ This is literally paid time now.

#### TIM

He can skip!

##### [transition beep]

#### BEN

"We have about... 17 minutes left, so that's good that you're keen. Um, anyway--"

#### TIM

"Keen."

#### BEN

"The one f--"

#### TIM

"Keen. __[pause]__ Sorry, keep going."

#### BEN

"The one--"

#### TIM

"Keen. No, sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt. Just keep going."

#### BEN [breaks into laughter]

Sonnuva b__[bleep]__tch. __[both laugh]__

#### BEN

We'll keep going with that, I just need to not break. [__TIM:__ Okay.] Oh, it's funny cause I know you're gonna say keen...

#### TIM

We'll go from the "keen". We'll go from the first 'keen.' We'll go from the first 'keen.'

#### BEN [still laughing]

Yeah, yeah, yeah, I just need-- gimme a second.

#### TIM [imitating]

'Gimme a second. Oh, hang on.'

##### [transition beep]

#### BEN

'*Dah*ling.' Why bother pausing it, Tim, we've got so much time to catch up on?

##### [transition beep]

#### BEN

"And how do you begin sex?"

#### TIM

"Well, when one being loves another being, or is-- is--" no, hang on, what do I want to say? __[breaks into laughter]__ Do we want to explain sex to David?

#### BEN

I'm taking us there. I want to hear Trexel explain-- this is what the people want!

#### TIM

This is what they want. Okay.

#### BEN [clapping for emphasis]

Let! David! Say! F-__[bleep]__!

##### [transition beep]

#### BEN

Just tell me to shut up.

#### TIM

__[immediately]__ "Shut up, David! Shut up, shut up, shut up!"

#### BEN

...but wait for me to have a clean take, [__TIM:__ "Shut up!"] because __[laughing]__ I hadn't quite finished.

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Episode 22 of Stellar Firma, uhm... we had a little bit of a sing-song, [__BEN:__ Yeah!] y'know, it's nice in the room.

Hey, hey, Alex, Everything Everything's a really good band.

It's a band entirely comprised of birds--

#### BEN

Crows.

#### TIM

Crows. Crows singing.

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

So... we'll go from me entering I suppose?

#### BEN

Wha-- yeah. That's what that preamble means.

#### TIM

I just sort of need you to make a noise... so-- __[Ben makes a David noise, both laugh]__

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM [burps, farts]

...okay. __[both laugh, Tim sighs]__

#### BEN

For f-__[bleep]__'s sake.

#### TIM

So sorry.You want that sort of clear, or...

#### BEN

Just Tim expelling gas from both ends!

#### TIM

A burp and a fart and off we go. Okay, right.

#### BEN

No, not off we go! [__TIM:__ Off we go.] Okay, just let me have a-- give me a f-__[bleep]__-ing moment.

#### TIM

Off we go!

#### BEN

You-- It was a well-timed burp and a fart on the go, so... __[sighs]__

##### [transition beep]

#### BEN [laughing]

Stop trying to make me laugh. __[Tim starts laughing]__ This is making it take longer.

##### [transition beep]

#### BEN

"Oh, oh, speaking of sad dough, um, their homeworld was destroyed by invading space whales."

#### TIM

"Oh-- oh, bo. Oh, no-fa-fa. Oh-fo-fluff."

#### BEN

__[laughs]__ "Oh, bo!"

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

"She's a space whale. You know, i-- it's a more simple system."

##### [long beat]

#### BEN [mouth noise, sort of like smacking lips]

"Fair enough." I really killed that.

#### TIM

__[laughs]__ Okay, so we'll go from the, from the end of that and you'll just move on. Just move on.

#### BEN

Yeah, I-- I-- I just--

#### TIM

When in doubt, move on.

#### BEN

My brain just seized up.

#### TIM

__[laughs]__ "Space whale!" __[Ben laughs]__

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

"What does a space whale dislike? Uh-- __[pause]__ Thinking in real time now." __[Ben laughs]__ "Uhhhhh... Oh, it's like--"

#### BEN

Just say something.

#### TIM

And-- Oh, thank you. __[laughs]__

#### BEN

Well, I mean, I'm not the one sitting here in silence. __[both laugh]__

##### [transition beep]

#### BEN

"--incident."

#### TIM

"Yes! It's like a safe zone. Fill it with loads of nations, it's really difficult to decide who you want to kill."

#### BEN

"Exactly, sort of a Demilitarized Planet."

#### TIM

"Yes, yes, but they can't know it's a DMZ, because you know what they hate?"

#### BEN

It's a DMP.

#### TIM

Ah, f-__[bleep]__ me. Also, I don't want to say this. This is, this is nothing.

#### BEN

Okay. __[both laugh]__

##### [transition beep]

#### BEN

"The one thing they've said is they hate *right* angles."

#### TIM

"Ah, it's got four, hasn't it?"

#### BEN

"Yes."

#### TIM

"I've got an idea. What happens when you glue two pyramids bottom to bottom together?"

#### BEN

"You *do* get rid of the right angles."

#### TIM

Nah, I've just realized you don't because--

#### BEN

Yeah, you do.

#### TIM

--there's no-- there's still a square. __[laughs]__

#### BEN

"Oh yeah, round the middle."

#### TIM

This isn't a good f-- Hang on. Wait. _[crosstalk]_ I know Trexel isn't supposed to have good ideas--

#### BEN

_[crosstalk]_ Look, what-- what-- what we're telling is that the Meredith brothers don't really know much about geometry.

#### TIM

"Oh, shapes! Shapes!"

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

"Let's make it a cone."

#### BEN

"Okay, right. Good and--"

#### TIM

"And also, cone sort of sounds like clone. I don't think that's anything, but I think we should note it." __[Ben and Tim laugh]__ No? __[both continue laughing]__

#### BEN

No, I just-- I really wa-- Okay, no. I like it; I just didn't expect it. __[both continue laughing]__

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

__[screeches]__ "'Repent, Trexel Geistman! Repent!' And I'm like, 'No, thank you.' And I'm trying to close the door but their, their foot's in the door. And I'm slamming it. And their foot's bleeding now. And then there's a, there's a bit of a foot in my house! What am I going to do with it then? What do I need-- I'm using it as a paperweight but it's starting to smell?"

##### [pause then Ben laughs]

#### TIM

Come on, Ben!

#### BEN

Come-- What?! Stop being so funny!

#### TIM

No! __[drawn out bleep]__ Okay, so, luckily, again, you held yourself for long enough--

#### BEN

Yeah, that's-- that-- literally, that's why I'm quiet. I'm s-- I'm trying to hold it in 'cause I don't want to ruin the take. __[sighs, hits something]__

#### TIM

Nearly there. 18 minutes, 23 seconds.

#### BEN

Just, again, did not expect you to go... there.

#### TIM [laughs]

I'm enjoying this.

#### BEN

Good, good, and I'm glad and it's fun. It's just--

#### TIM

Yeah. Alex, sorry, in case you weren't noticing, these are good and they're __[bleep]__. Enjoy them. __[laughs]__ I've got a rotting part of a foot as a paperweight.

#### BEN

Exactly! And you expected me to just *blast* right past that, did you?

#### TIM

Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah.

#### BEN

Oh, god.

#### TIM

Okay.

##### [transition beep]

#### BEN

"Well, that's lucky because-- oop, boop-- there it goes. CLUNK! Hmm. I just-- sorry, I just--" __[fake cough]__

#### TIM

"You don't need to do the foley for it, David."

#### BEN

Uh, no that was-- that was David coughing.

#### TIM

_[crosstalk]_ Oh! Was that a cough?

#### BEN

_[crosstalk]_ To cover the clunk.

#### TIM

CLUNK!

#### BEN

Well, that was-- __[laughs]__ Yes, it was a *bad* cough.

#### TIM

A-CLUNK!

#### BEN

I mean-- no. Okay, I'll drop it. [__TIM:__ Yeah.] I tried something; it didn't work. CLUNK!

#### TIM

__[laughs]__ Er-CLUNK! "David, I-- I noticed it *more* because you did that." __[both laugh]__

#### TIM

CLUNK! TUBE NOISE!

#### BEN

__[laughs]__ Nothing wrong! __[fake cough]__

#### TIM

It wasn't all like this but whenever you submit it, like, there is some foley but you always go 'blelelep!" __[both laugh]__

#### TIM

Blu-blop!

#### BEN

Boop-ba-boo-bop-boo!

#### TIM

Okay, okay, okay, we're so close to the end! We're so close to the end. __[Ben sighs]__

##### [transition beep]

##### [Tim as Trexel screaming]

##### [pause]

#### BEN [laughs]

Christ!

#### TIM

Let's give you another scream.

##### [beep]

#### TIM

Fun one. __[shouting]__ "Oh, no!"__ [laughs]__ Not that one.

#### BEN

__[laughing]__ That wasn't Trexel's voice.

##### [beep]

#### TIM

__[shouts again]__ Okay, that's enough. You can work-- you can work it out from those screams, I'm sure. __[Ben laughs]__ If you need another scream, let me know.

##### [transition beep]

#### BEN

"How about a government-mandated limited entertainment policy?"

#### TIM

"Oh, no, that wouldn't be good at all. Wait, sorry, no, that would be good. Sorry, I didn't mean to negate that. __[laughs]__ You try that line again and I'll have a different response." __[Ben snorts]__

##### [transition beep]

#### BEN

"What about a government-mandated entertainment policy?"

#### TIM

"That's even better! Forget the transport stuff, that's b-__[bleep]__-s. That's a swear. __[both laugh]__ Try it all again! All of it again! Lock the doors! Shut your face! Let's do it again! Okay! Ha ha!"

##### [transition beep]

#### BEN

"Yeah, okay, right. So... there's other ideas here and I don't have any!"

#### TIM

"What?" __[both laugh]__

#### BEN

That was just me... checking out of--

#### TIM

Did you ju-- Did you run out?

#### BEN

I just went-- I just went, "Well--"

#### TIM

Well...

#### BEN

BEEEEEEE--

#### TIM

Well, nothing.

#### BEN

Yeah.

#### TIM

We're done. __[Ben laughs]__

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

"They're going to need so much oil in order to make this all work. You can't wrestle when you're not oiled. _[crosstalk]_ Otherwise you'll grip."

#### BEN

_[crosstalk]_ "And meat."

#### TIM

"What?"

#### BEN

"I just completely spoke over you. I'm really sorry."

#### TIM

"You son of a __[bleep]__."

#### BEN

__[sad]__ "Oh."

##### [transition beep]

##### [pause]

#### TIM

"Oh, yes, it's me."

##### [JENNY laughs]

#### BEN

You started last time. __[laughs]__

#### TIM

"I forgot. I forgot. Let's just put another clap in there. Okay." __[hand clap marker]__

#### BEN

He-- he's not breaking out of Trexel. We're in trouble.

##### [transition beep]

#### JENNY

"You're a complete... idiosyncratic... egotistical... maniac... Uh. Other words."

#### TIM

"Many people have tried to define me and it is difficult, yes." __[Ben chuckles, Tim laughs]__ Just laughing now?

#### BEN

Wha--? Oh, did I just let that out loud?

#### TIM

You just la-- you just laughed.

#### BEN

I just let out a little chuckle. I'm sorry. __[sighs]__

#### JENNY

What, we'll go back to it.

#### TIM

You just-- you just-- you were just like __[chuckles]__.

#### BEN

I didn't even-- I didn't even realize.

#### TIM

__[imitating Ben]__ 'Oh, I enjoy this podcast!'

#### BEN [in a similar voice]

'This is great. You guys are really funny.'

##### [transition beep]

##### [Jenny as Hartro trying not to vomit]

#### TIM

"Trexel, are you alright? Trexel? You're-- __[long bleep]__. Argh!"

#### BEN

Everyone is Trexel, apparently.

#### TIM

Everybody's Trexel.

#### BEN

Give the man a puppet and everyone in the world is Trexel.

#### TIM

Give a man a puppet, he'll bond with that puppet. Give him two puppets, puppet city. __[Ben laughs]__ You know, it just happens.

#### JENNY

Oh, I feel sorry for Alex. This is so much he's--

#### TIM

__[laughs]__ It's, you know. It's the life he chose.

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

This is Stellar Firma episode 17. Ben and Tim Meredith presiding. The time is 17:39 in the PM. Uh, this is the first episode after the... review. So, we're going to start with some--

#### BEN

No.

#### TIM

--little vocal-- little mouthy warmups, and then we're going to do--

#### BEN

It's the first episode after the team-building exercise.

#### TIM

Team building. Sorry, I meant to say that. I thought team review and then said team-building exercise.

#### BEN

Nope. Other way around.

#### TIM

No. Gah. I am a protected category. __[Ben laughs]__ And, like an endangered--

#### BEN

Not for thinking!

#### TIM

Yep, absolutely. Dyslexia is all about thinking, ding-dong. Ha ha! __[screaming]__ "Ah ha! Finally! My victory is here!"

#### BEN

Damn it.

#### TIM

__[screeching]__ "Avant Geistman!" __[Ben laughs]__ Um, yeah. Yeah. So, uh, hi Alex. I'm officially dyslexic, so, any mistakes I make--

#### BEN

He's always been officially dyslexic. He's just making it a thing now.

#### TIM

I'm just making a thing now. I'm leaning into it. __[Ben scoffs]__ I-I'm woke. Is that what that means? I don't think so. But-- Can you be woke about yourself about something you already knew but are now, are now exploiting?

#### BEN

Yeah, yeah, exactly.

#### TIM

I suppose so.

#### BEN

Pretty sure you're un-woke at that point.

#### TIM

Yeah, look, it's all about me. __[Ben laughs]__ Look, I am the most, uh, derided member of society: the idiot. And we have our time now. We're in government now. We're in-- _[crosstalk]_ Some hot satire. Hot, hot satire. Hot sat--

#### BEN

_[crosstalk]_ That's very unfair to dyslexic people. Very, very unfair.

#### TIM

What, you mean, my people?

#### BEN

Yes, your people.

#### TIM

I speak for them all! __[laughs]__ Every single one!

#### BEN

I-- I think Alex might *also* be dyslexic, so we'll let him get back to you on that one.

#### TIM

Yeah, well, you know, he's one of the splitters.__ [Ben laughs]__ He's one of the intelligents. Uh--

#### BEN

So, how's-- how's recording going, Tim?

#### TIM

That's a-- It's going real well.

#### BEN

Good.

#### TIM

Going real-- Costing Alex money every second-- __[laughs]__ Uhm--

#### BEN

Then you insult him for.

#### TIM

Then I insult him for. Um, but you know what? He's knows that it's from this, uh, these humble beginnings-- the pots of, uh, pots of-- of hot humour do, uh, do boil and froth over into the cups of the waiting, uh, people below. This froth and--

##### [transition beep]

#### BEN

Oh, Tim.

#### TIM

Oh, Tim. Oh, Tim, please. Have you had a cup of regular coffee and some semi-skim milk? I think you have, you scamp! __[Ben chuckles]__ Oh, what's he like?

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

So, this is the recording of Stellar Firma episode 21.

#### BEN

God, there's *loads* of them. Maybe we should stop.

##### [transition beep]

#### BEN

"Really, Trexel?"

#### TIM

"Yes, really, David. Because you've been, you've been leading me around by my nose like a big... nose... dog. I'm going to do that again, 'cause that's nothing." __[Ben laughs]__

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

"Okay, great. So, we've got a lake of water, a lake of fire, a lake of air, a lake of *goo* for David, and also a freshly tilled lake of earth." __[Simon and Ben laugh]__ Was it 'freshly tilled'?

#### BEN

Stop the timer.

#### SIMON

It's just funny. It's just a funny concept.

#### TIM

Okay. Alright. Fine. We will do this, come on.

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

"Two Three Four--" __[pause]__ The song.

#### BEN

Oh, that was-- that felt really wrong that we didn't actually do anything. Somebody said, 'two three four' and the song didn't start? [__TIM:__ And the song didn't start.] And I'm like, 'uhh...'

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

♪ "The cosmic lounge, the cosmic lounge--" ♫

#### SIMON

I thought you were going to do 'two three four.'

#### TIM

No, because--

#### BEN

Count you-- count yourself in *every* time.

#### SIMON

Yeah.

#### TIM

Fine.

#### BEN

Start the takes the same way.

#### TIM

Fine. Okay.

#### BEN

Don't make more work for the editor.

#### TIM

But, they're not me! __[chuckles]__ Okay. "Two, three, four--" __[all talk over each other]__ "Oh, f-__[bleep]__ me!"

#### SIMON

"Oh, the Cosmic Lounge." __[Ben laughs, Tim makes frustrated noises]__

#### TIM

This is worth it.

#### BEN

It's not a hard song!

#### TIM

It's a hard song. Right.

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

"This is the brief!"

#### BEN

"Um..."

#### TIM

"It's been stopping in the tube!"

#### BEN

"Oh, that's weird!"

#### TIM

"What have you been doing?"

#### BEN

"Oh, that's weird and the first time--"

#### TIM

"Who has done this to me, David?"

#### BEN

"Um..."

#### TIM

"David, I knew you were betraying me somehow!"

#### BEN

"No."

#### TIM [shouting]

"Burn it all down!"

#### BEN

"What?"

#### TIM

"*Burn*-- no--"

#### BEN

"No!"

#### TIM

__[stutters]__ "Don't burn it all down, fix it!--" __[coughing fit, Ben laughs]__

#### BEN

Tim has died.

#### TIM

Tim has died. Also, don't burn it all down.

#### SIMON

Just note: Tim died.

#### TIM

Tim died.

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

"If you don't walk with a left, right, I will put your head into a chemical toilet."

#### BEN [quiet]

"Okay. I'll walk."

#### TIM

That was too dark. __[both laugh]__ That was far too dark.

#### BEN

__[bleep]__ Trexel. __[laughs]__

#### TIM

Yeah, yeah. Okay.

##### [transition beep]

#### BEN

"Trexel stole the brief! Trexel took the brief! I didn't do anything!"

#### TIM

"You Judas! Judas Iscariot! [__JENNY:__ "Save it!"] We've decided not to mention Judas." __[all laugh]__ I like shouting Judas Iscariot.

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

"--curly wig."

#### JENNY

"And could you please put the fish down?"

#### TIM

"What-- It's my-- Okay, fine. I'll just pop that back in there. I'll deal with you... later. Wink. I'm gonna f-__[bleep]__ that fish." __[all laugh]__

#### JENNY

__[imitating IMOGEN]__ Wink detected.

#### TIM [imitating IMOGEN]

Bestiality detected.

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

"David 7. Child murderer? Who can say? That's not what we're here about." Let's not do child murder. __[all laugh]__ Okay. Let me-- Okay.

#### BEN

Dog strangler.

#### TIM

"Dog strangler. He sets fires to orphanages."

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

"Helping the small guy. The small businessperson. The little person. Th-- the microscopic germ that's been assaulted." That's too dark, Tim. Um-- __[Alex and Jenny laugh]__ Assaulted? Don-- don't mention assault. Uh--

#### BEN

Defrauded.

#### TIM

Defrauded. Okay.

#### BEN

'The microscopic germ that's just leaving political adverts outside its sphere.'

#### TIM

__[satirically]__ "The c-__[bleep]__. The liberal c-__[bleep]__. Who's going to stand up for the c-__[bleep]__."

#### ALEX [laughing]

God.

#### TIM [satirically]

"The alt-right nazi; that guy needs help apparently." Right.

#### JENNY

Get it out. __[laughs]__

#### TIM

Get it out. Get it all out. __[bleep]__ Okay, cool.

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

"It is with great personal sacrifice that I now turn in my access card to IMOGEN and *hope* that in this I am swapping that out and saving the sweet clone life of David 7. __[pause]__ Tummy rumble." __[laughter]__

#### ALEX

I need the last couple of words.

#### TIM

"And so, it is with--" Hang on a minute. __[all laugh]__ "There is a stomach in the courtroom today. A stomach in the room. It is mine. So--" __[laughter]__

#### ALEX

So if you press crosscut into this crosscut between various takes... __[laughter]__

#### TIM

Okay.

#### JENNY

I mean, it is lunchtime.

#### TIM

"I'll do them all in vastly different voices to make it difficult."

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

"So, it is in closing and with great personal sacrifice that I, Trexel 'Whats-its' Geistman--" No, that's not-- __[Ben and Jenny laugh]__ So warm.

##### [transition beep]

#### JENNY

"I'm going to keep my eyes on you, Treckle." Treckle!? __[laughter]__

#### BEN

Trecky boy.

#### TIM

"Ol' little Treckle."

##### [transition beep]

#### BEN

"That's it. Right!"

#### TIM

"Well, uh, oh--"

"Argh, give me that. Give me that."

"Get off my satchel!"

Sorry. __[chuckles]__ "Put your foot in my mouth!"

#### ALEX [background]

Okay, tweak the levels. __[Jenny and Ben laugh]__

#### TIM

Okay. Don't we go--

#### BEN [passionately]

All podcasts end as fetish podcasts eventually!

#### TIM

Right.

##### [transition beep]

#### TIM

__[laughing]__ Use the ones that you think are good.

#### BEN

Look, make Tim look good, but not *too* good.

#### TIM

Not too good.
