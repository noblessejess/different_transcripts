#### TIM

Hello, and welcome to the Stellar Firma Season 3 mailbag. My name's Tim. And this crazy cat over here is called...

#### BEN

Ben.

#### TIM

There he is. They call him Jazzy Ben.

#### BEN

I'm very-- Yes.

#### TIM

Old Fun Ben.

#### BEN

I'm very, very fun. Um. Yes.

#### TIM

What crazy capers have you been getting up to recently?

#### BEN

I... ate an apple?

#### TIM

Uh huh. Kid, did you eat the core? Or did you discard that for safety reasons?

#####[Ben begins repeating the word 'no']

#### BEN

I, you know, cyanide.

#### TIM

__[laughs]__ God, you can't keep him down.

So we've received your questions. __[both begin laughing]__ I'm gonna do a sort of a radio presenter voice. We've received your--

#### BEN

_(in a terrifying, bubbly voice)_ Hullo, everybody!

#### TIM

We've received your questions via the... internet, and we've got a little selection here that we're gonna scroll through and try and let you in on a little insight on the crazy, oh gosh, what a bunch of-- how it's made and stuff. It's mostly microphones and Zoom.

#### BEN

Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

#### TIM

Um, scoop. Scoop? [__BEN:__ Scoop?] Skype. I was trying to say Skype but also Zoom, so I said scoop.

#### BEN

Scoop!

#### TIM

It's just sc-- You know what? When we're making Stellar FIrma, the secret is scoop. No more questions.

#### BEN

Tim texts me. He's like, 'Hi Ben, scoop me.'

#### TIM

_(laughing)_ Um, 'Ben. Scoop?' And then I just get an emoji of, I don't know, Bruce Willis doing a thumbs up. I don't know.

#### BEN

There's an emoji of him? That's a gif now? Is it an emoji or a gif?

#### TIM

I don't know gifs. I don't know-- Is a gif-- I'm very-- Look, I'm 28, but I'm also incredibly old. __[they laugh]__ I am both of those things.

So we're gonna take it in turns. I'm gonna let Ben take the first reading of a question.

#### BEN

Right. So the first question we have is from B.N. Mara, and the question is:

> With the between seasons content, crossovers, and the album, you've explored quite a lot formats within the Stellar Firma universe. Given unlimited time and resources, is there any format or story you would still want to try out? Not in the 'what can we expect in the future' sense, but more along the lines of 'this sounds absolutely ridiculous, and is technically impossible, but sure would be fun.'

#### TIM

I did have a thought.

#### BEN

Oh!

#### TIM

Not technically-- Yeah, I know, it's shocking, isn't it?

#### BEN

A whole thought?

#### TIM

A whole-- Well, you know what? Let's say I've got three-quarters and see what happens towards the end.

#### BEN

Okay, okay.

#### TIM

I was thinking not technically impossible, but it'd be really cool to do proper animated episodes. I think the show would suit animation quite well.

#### BEN

Yes.

#### TIM

'Cause it's like a one-room show, but with a lot of speculative thinking of elsewhere, and--

#### BEN

Yeaaah. I think also it's the only kind of format that could keep up with the vastly varying descriptions we give of the characters.

#### TIM

You'd need things to be fluid. You'd need a background to be able to change and change back without it being strange. I think animation's your friend there.

#### BEN

Well, quite honestly, the animatics that I've seen, fan-made animatics, are all fabulous.

#### TIM

Yeah. So just like, full 35 minute versions of those, please.

#### BEN

Yes.

#### TIM

But for new productions.

#### BEN

Yes, absolutely.

#### TIM

If anybody knows Laika, put them in touch with us.

#### BEN

So wait, hang on a minute. You're going stop motion, not drawn?

#### TIM

I didn't think that until I said Laika, 'cause I was trying to remember an animation house. But that would be cool.

#### BEN

Stop motion would be-- Actually, yes, unlimited time and budget. Stop motion! Because it's just a really fun format. It's a fun medium.

#### TIM

Imagine *Trexel and the Two Strings*, come on. __[Ben groans]__ That'd be good. 'What are these strings for? Who are you? Are you some sort of metaphor for death? Augh, piss off!' You know, it'd be great.

#### BEN

_(laughing)_ Yeah, I mean, to be honest, I don't have a different answer. I think that would be fab. I'd really like to see that, and that has crowded anything else that could have been in my brain out of it, as I'm now like 'stop motion Stellar Firma pleaaase.'

#### TIM

Would that be classed as a full thought, Ben? Would you allow it?

#### BEN

I think that's a thought and a half, to be honest.

#### TIM

I can't believe the show's over and I've just hit my stride.

#### BEN

Yeah, that's it. __[laughing]__

#### TIM

That, and also -- and this is totally out of our control in terms of being able to do -- would be liveshows. I'd love to do some live stage performances because, oh. Ooh, it would be fun.

#### BEN

Ooooh, Live improv. Oooh.

#### TIM

How do you feel about that, Ben?

#### BEN

Mmm. Mixed?

#### TIM

I think you'd be good.

#### BEN

Mixed. I mean, the, um--

#### TIM

You know the character too-- Well, you know the character well enough for I think it not be an issue.

#### BEN

Yeah yeah yeah. The-- Oh no, what was the name of it? Um, [Outpost Con](https://youtu.be/nxknfoeBjbs). The Outpost Con panel we did. That was fun.

#### TIM

Yeah yeah yeah! It would essentially be that, except, you know, in a hot sweaty room in Brighton.

#### BEN

Yeah, also, we did a panel for Outpost Con, and I don't know if you can access it like publicly?

#### TIM

It's on YouTube.

#### BEN

It's on YouTube?

#### TIM

It's on YouTube, mate.

#### BEN

Oh well in which case, we did one for Outpost Con, so go... take a look.

#### TIM

Go take a look. Can't tell you how to find it. Google 'Outpost Con,' and, I don't know, 'Stellar Firma,' and you'll probably find it.

#### BEN

I would assume it would have the name of the thing we're doing.

#### TIM

You hope so. I've definitely-- It's linked to on the discord every now and again, and I'll watch it when I'm feeling down. 'Cause we did an excellent job.

#### BEN

Oh, good. Good.

#### TIM

This one is from... no name.

#### BEN

I think that's from many people.

#### TIM

I, yeah. Or, it was just anonymously submitted, but there's just like an all-lowercase, in brackets, [no name.]

#### BEN

They've been stricken from the record!

#### TIM

So:
> In the season 1 Q&A, you mentioned that you knew how the story would end. Did that change as seasons two and three went on with all the twists and turns? Or did it serve as a guiding point for the entirety of the production? What was it like to see where the story went, and how the initial proposal changed from planet designing to sales to complaints and so on, in comparison to what you expected when you first started out."

I apologise for how poorly I read that. There were many subclauses, and my face got away from my brain.

#### BEN

The broad strokes were the same, and I need to remember that all the episodes have aired now, so there is no spoilers anymore, 'cause they're all out there.

#### TIM

Spoiler away.

#### BEN

Um, so, definitely from my part, it was quite similar except that I was definitely advocating for David to just be like 'sod this' and explode the whole station? And just kill everyone?

#### TIM

Yeah, yeah. Ben is a very harsh advocate for that ending. And you know what? I had sympathy for that ending. I liked it, I was on board, _then_ we pitched it to the network, and they said "Do... Do you... Hey, guys, hi, um."

#### BEN

Is the "protagonist murder everyone" ending really--?

#### TIM

"Do you want to finish your comedy show with a genocide? I'm not sure you do. I think you think that will be good," and they did have a point. I think they did have a point.

#### BEN

I'm a big fan of like, bleak, punchy endings. And we knew, obviously--

#### TIM

You'd like all plays to end with a gunshot and then cut to black.

#### BEN

Uh no, I'm not a student production of anything.

#### TIM

"I'm gonna smoke on stage and say the word __[bleep]__ because I can!"

#### BEN

Yeah, well, you've just been bleeped out, so you can't say that word.

#### TIM

Oh, I've been censored!

#### BEN

Yeah, that's it. Um, quick, get a column about how you've been silenced!

#### TIM

_(laughing)_ Give me this microphone and this television show. "Let me speak!"

#### BEN

Yep.

#### TIM

Do you think when I said 'cigarette' they had to bleep it out as well because of, uh-- No?

#### BEN

Nooo. I think we can acknowledge the existence of smoking-- We'll do a George Lucas and just call them death sticks.

#### TIM

Death sticks.

#### BEN

Care for a death stick?

#### TIM

What about this? What about this? "Mere-juana. Bennies."

#### BEN

Do you want a puff tube?

#### TIM

Lewd... lewds.

#### BEN

Lewds?! That is a different thing, Tim.

#### TIM

Quaalude.

#### BEN

No, a lewd-- Well, okay, now lewd mean-- Anyway, we're getting off topic.

But there were two significant changes, 'cause the broad strokes were the same. Which was first: Trexel blew himself out of an airlock, [__TIM:__ Yes.] not an escape pod, and took-- Everyone died.

#### TIM

It was very deathy.

#### BEN

So the same people went out the airlock, but everybody died, and then David was like, "Self destruct Stellar Firma," and everyone goes boom.

#### TIM

Yeah, but we warned off the "everyone's dead." And you know what? That was also a certain amount of-- Whilst we very much built Stellar Firma as a three season arc, when we got to the end of it, there was a certain amount of, like, "I don't want to murder all these people necessarily! We might want to do something with them at some point in the future."

#### BEN

Yeah, maybe.

#### TIM

Maybe. Maybe not, who knows. You can't do that if they're all dead. So there was very much a "this story sits on its own, we could stop now and never do anything again and I'd still be very happy with what we've done," or "two years time we come back to it and do something, who knows." Open to discussion.

#### BEN

And kind of to the second part-- 'cause basically, "how was the ending?" Basically the same, but we made it a little lighter, and, I think in retrospect, better. [__TIM:__ Yeah.] Hopefully. Unless it came out and everybody hated it. [__TIM:__ Yeah.] At which point it was terrible, and I never wanted it to happen, and they throttled me creatively.

#### TIM

And we were against those changes. We wanted to kill them all and they wouldn't let us. It's not that we had the meeting and agreed.

#### BEN

Unless you did like it, and then we actually went to Rusty Quill and suggested it ourselves.

But the second part of that question is also like, "What was it like to see where the story went and how the initial proposal changed in comparison to what we expected?" And like I think it-- It was interesting. Obviously the proposals changed mainly to keep things fresh, 'cause we got to the end of season one-- And I think we've spoken about this before. We got to the end of season one and were like, "Well, we're running out of ideas. Let's reframe the problem."

#### TIM

Yeah. Because especially in improv, it's not like the characters changed, or what we were doing really changed, but there was just a little bit of change in perspective that allows you to do more, be silly in a different way. 'Cause at the end of the day, we're taking briefs and we're coming up with ideas. But when you could be like, "Right, this is a bit more salesy, that one's about war," it's just-- It just keeps it fresh and fun and means that you don't get to episode 50 and think "Oh god, what have we done? I can't remember."

#### BEN

And you can only ask, like, "So what's the gravity like?" so many times before you're like, "Look, we've answered the question basically every way this can be answered."

#### TIM

And Bryn is unhappy with every answer we come up with.

#### BEN

Oh, yes, absolutely.

#### TIM

I can't believe that man.

#### BEN

Yeah, and like also, I think the one thing that is noticed, or Tim sort of got on when we were planning out season three, I think you will notice that seasons one and two? You know, the characters are pretty consistent, and then season three went, "Ah yes, a narrative. We should... have one of those."

#### TIM

"Let's develop these characters."

#### BEN

Yes. _(laughing)_ So I think they went through a little more change.

#### TIM

Yeah. The show was conceived in a very sort of "this will be fun in a quite low production, heavy thing," and then towards season three we were like, "actually we can do more with this, we can do more with the characters, we can do more with the plot." Partly because we were coming to the end, and it's suddenly like, "Oh gosh, here's the last chance to do it. To do a lot of that."

#### BEN

And also to a certain extent, thanks to you lot. People listen to it, and it's like, "Oh, well, we should put in, you know."

#### TIM

We should put in more effort into this, 'cause people seem to like it. Someone's done an animatic. Let's step up our game!

#### BEN

Absolutely.

Actually, this is good that I'm reading this out, 'cause it's kind of a question for you, I wasn't really involved.

>Did you have to convince Alex to let you do the album, or was he onboard straightaway?

#### TIM

He was onboard after I'd announced it. __[Ben cracks up]__ Ummm... yes. So, it was something we were sort of joking about. We were like, "Oooh, wouldn't it be," and then I mocked up a demo, and I released it, and I got a message from him saying, "Right, so this is happening then, is it?" And he was very very helpful, and very onboard, and thought it could be a good thing, but then was very much a "I decided it was something I would tell people we would do," and then he was like, "Well, I suppose we should now."

#### BEN

Definitely an asking forgiveness rather than permission kind of moment.

#### TIM

The tail somewhat wagged the dog on that on. But, yes. I worked on it on my own, doing demos for all but one or two of the songs which came to the end. So I had sort of demos and all of them, and then Alex said, "Would you like some money to do some production value with this?" And that's when we got Doctor Beaver and Joe involved, and went to a lovely studio and recorded everyone. In a race against time for lockdown as I remember.

#### BEN

Yes, yes, I think we were like the last weekend before lockdown. We were like, "Just get it done!"

#### TIM

"Just let me in the studio!" All worked out, all worked out. But yes, he was very supportive.

Iris!

> At what point did you know that you wanted Bathin to be a voiced character, and how did you pick Travis McElroy eventually?

#### BEN

Yes.

#### TIM

Picked! Yes, 'cause we were like, "Get me Travis!" We demanded as we stamped on a cigar in an office.

#### BEN

No, I think -- and correct me if I'm wrong, Tim -- this was basically a pretty much purely opportunistic thing.

#### TIM

Oh, yeah.

#### BEN

Travis tweeted that he enjoyed the Magnus Archives. Both Tim and I are fans of some of the McElroy's stuff. Like, we both listen to MBMBAM.

#### TIM

I love a Monster Factory.

#### BEN

Monster Factory's a lot of fun. I heartily enjoyed Amnesty and Balance. You know, we were like, ooh, we could maybe have the McElroys as a guest star! That would be very helpful for publicity, given their profile weight compared to ours.

#### TIM

It's no small thing. We are a relatively small production.

#### BEN

Absolutely. So there's solid advertising and the ability to reach a larger audience by including people.

#### TIM

I didn't intend initially-- I sort of thought Bathin would remain unvoiced and wouldn't turn up.

#### BEN

Yeah. Well, it's 'cause Bathin was an offhand joke from a submission.

#### TIM

Yeah. Bathin has taken on a lot more importance than I ever intended.

#### BEN

Yes. I suppose, actually, for the second question: that's one thing where the story changed. Like, Bathin was just like a, "Oh look here's a hunky poster boy."

#### TIM

I think so much of what has become popular and quote, unquote important to the canon has all been like, "Oh, oh! That's the thing that everyone-- Okay, well let's write in more of that."

#### BEN

And also, I think vastly more of Bathin's character's exists in fanworks than it ever does in, y'know.

#### TIM

If you actually add up all of the details [__BEN:__ Oh, there's nothing.] of Bathin, it's about three lines and a lot of yelling *BATHIN*.

#### BEN

Yeah. Pretty much, pretty much.

From Nix:

> Was Hartro helping out the main gang always intended to be a season three plot point?

Where did that idea come from?

#### TIM

Jenny is fuuun to work with.

#### BEN

Yes. Yes, Hartro is very good. And I think-- Was it? Did we plan it in the third season, or was it the case where we just had an episode with Jenny in it, and we were just like, "We need to do this more, because there's not gonna be enough like, review episodes before we stop."

#### TIM

Yes, yes. There's a certain amount of 'we wanna get Jenny in for more stuff,' the dynamic of the three of them together is so much fun.

#### BEN

Ah, yeah.

#### TIM

But we can't just book-- Like, for two seasons, it's been every review, and we-- Yeah, you can't just be like, "It's reviews every week now! Every day now." So, yeah, we just decided to have her in for a run, and it was a lot of fun, those records. Almost like 90% of the bloopers come out of those records.

#### BEN

I think that is my favourite section of the show, to be honest.

#### TIM

I'd agree. I'd agree.

#### BEN

Definitely the best part, I think, of season 3. Obviously, different episodes have highlights, but as a run, having Jenny on and doing a, um-- What's it called? A three-hander, right?

#### TIM

A three-hander?

#### BEN

Yes.

#### TIM

As opposed to, Ben?

#### BEN

A two-hander.

#### TIM

Correct. Now, you're a theatreman.

#### BEN

OOoooh. They call me Ben Theatreman.

#### TIM

Do your best toast impression. Umm, uhh, can you hear me, toast?

#### BEN

I can hear you, Clemfandango!

#### TIM

Now can I do it?

#### BEN

_(softly)_ Can you hear me, toast?

#### TIM

_(imitating Matt Berry)_ I can hear you, Clemfandango!

#### BEN

Oh, yes, of course, it's Matt Berry, so you have to be like, "ClaaaAAAAaaaAAMmm...."

#### TIM

I'd like a cup of teaaa. I'm sort of a horse sometimes. Eh.

#### BEN

That's just Trexel at that point.

#### TIM

__[tired demogorgon noise]__ Shut up. Look, no one should know that Trexel is 30% Matt Berry, 20% Brian Blessed, and the rest is me!

#### BEN

It's a solid reci-- That's a very distressing but fun cocktail.

#### TIM

In short, Jenny was loads of fun to work with, so we found an excuse to work with her more.

#### BEN

Basically.

#### TIM

Ben! Next show-- three-hander with Jenny? Done, sold.

#### BEN

I mean, I'd be up for it.

#### TIM

In the books. That's how we decide things here. On the Q&A.

#### BEN

Depends-- Well, it's like with the album, we just announce it, and then Alex has to agree.

#### TIM

Yeah yeah yeah, yeah. We'll call it "The Ben and Jenny Show, Featuring Tim."

#### BEN

No no, not 'featuring,' 'feat.'

#### TIM

Feat.

#### BEN

Feat time.

#### TIM

And I'll be sort of moodily in the corner, spitting out rhymes.

#### BEN

Tim, you need to read this one now, thank you.

#### TIM

Oh, thanks, Ben. This one's from Strawcup:

>To what extent does the soundscaping and other audio editing add to or differ from what you have in mind when recording the episode? Does it help to make the more chaotic nature of the improv more cohesive?

#### BEN

Yeah, I think it's a process thing. So I think it's more for to answer. But I can definitely give my opinion on that second part.

#### TIM

'Cause you are very much divorced from the process in that you're involved in the recording, and then you basically hear the episode when it goes out. [__BEN:__ Yes.] Whereas I hear it at a couple of different stages? So how does it compare to what you think is going to happen?

#### BEN

Oh, I don't have anything in my brain. Unless we're like, unless wer--

#### TIM

At all, ever.

#### BEN

No, unless we're doing a specific gag about like, you know, you getting electrocuted in the doors, right? You know, that is like-- "Oh, yeah, there'll be like an electronic buzz kind of coming out of that." But from the listening point of view from when we record it, I think it absolutely does help us hugely to make the improv cohesive. Especially because standard audio drama stuff, but it massively helps to underscore the action. And that's really it: it gives you a sense of space and placement of the characters.

#### TIM

Movement and interaction.

#### BEN

Like, for example, one thing I didn't expect is when David's got their own room, we've got that muffled sound to tell you when characters are in the Business Warfare room, when characters are in David's, sort of-- the clone room. And that was really nice. Not that something I expected at all, but it massively helps to know where characters are.

#### TIM

Especially with the remote record. 'Cause it's hard from this side to sort of know how much it affects-- you know, being in a studio together and being able to sort of gesticulate and do more stuff. And like, a little bit of in-room foley? To "we are always all in separate places," sometimes three of us, and it can very easily end up being a weird, null space in which we are interacting, obviously Maddy most of all in the last series and a half, but Ed and David before then, just giving those things a bit of heft and a bit of weight.

I think a lot of like, slapstick is completely impossible to sell without it. And there is a fair bit of slapstick in the show, and I always like put it in, and know that Maddy or Ed and David before, will be able to sort of get the rhythms in there. And to be honest, most of the time I don't really have to do much on that. I just say, "Here it is," and every now and again I'm like, "move that a little bit forward," or, "Oh, I've heard a little mistake here," but nine times out of ten, especially in the last season with Maddy, she's absolutely nailed it. So well done, Maddy. Double award-winning, I'm looking up now the two sound design awards she won. I'm just looking across--

#### BEN

One for Ben? Two for Ben.

#### TIM

One for the show, one for Imogen, and one for Ben, is there--

#### BEN

Yeah, there's two there.

#### TIM

What, two? One's from 2019, one from 2020. Just checking if there's any more... You know, naught for two. Okay.

#### BEN

It's a good bit, and you're gonna dine on that for a long time.

#### TIM

Um, next question.

#### BEN

Uh, right. So this question is from Quinn:

> I feel like the satirical, political, pointed commentary on the 21st century society element has become more overt over time. Was that always intended in a 'hook them with comedy and then make them stop and think' kind of way, or did it just develop naturally?

#### TIM

I think it's a very natural development. I think there was a certain amount of, early on, we were just trying to make a-- "Right, does this work? Does this thing work? Right, comedy, gah." And then more of-- 'Cause like, loads of that stuff is just the kind of stuff me and Ben yell at each other anyway.

#### BEN

Yeah.

#### TIM

And I think when relaxed and calmed down a bit, a lot more of that had room-- 'Cause we were having fun.

#### BEN

And I think also like, it was always, always there, because I think anyone who pretends that -- well, to be honest -- any kind of fiction is apolitical, but especially sci-fi we are doing, this is obviously a sci-fi--

#### TIM

I'm just gonna stop you there, Ben. You really need to hit the 'a' in 'apolitical' because you just said, 'Anything that's a political,' and it didn't entirely come across that's what you were saying. A political what?

#### BEN

Yes, a-apolitical. Not political. You know, the, um...

#### TIM

You have a master's in English, and you can't speak.

#### BEN

I don't have a master's in speaking.

#### TIM

Well, English is... oh, my argument's fallen apart.

#### BEN/TIM

Wheeee!

#### TIM

_(cracking up)_ What was that?

#### BEN

I dunno! But it's like, a story anyway. It's a sci-fi story. It is a story about a corporate dystopia, and it's also a story where included the idea of clones. Which in and of itself is like--

#### TIM

It's a can of worms.

#### BEN

It's a can of worms! And to not address it and just be like, 'ha ha ha, clones are just a fun thing we don't need to examine any further!' is just cowardly, pathetic, and grossly irresponsible.

#### TIM

Well, I mean, we were hoping to be all of those things, but alas, we were brave, righteous, and really cool. Sorry, guys.

#### BEN

I realise the-- I'm not pretending we got it perfect, or even got it that right. Gave it our best shot.

#### TIM

I think we got not wrong enough the people were okay with it.

#### BEN

Yeah, yeah, and that's really all that I aim for.

#### TIM

And I also think that there was-- I do genuinely think this is part of it, I was listening throughout most of the production to a podcast called ["Revolutions."](https://thehistoryofrome.typepad.com/revolutions_podcast/) And it went from the French Revolution to the Russian Revolution during production, and I suddenly had a lot more facts about early communists.

#### BEN

I do enjoy how, yes, there's a lot of weird Trexel pulls about the Red Bolsheviks or something, and it's like, oh wow, that's a really obscure name you've pulled out there.

#### TIM

You know what? Let's talk about the Mensheviks. They don't as much. Known as the 'minority,' 'cause Bolshevik means majority and Menshevik means minority? I think, I can't remember if it's that way round. Stuff like that. It's a good podcast, listen to it.

#### BEN

I have a podcast recommendation if you just wanna be furious about everything.

#### TIM

Oh, yeah.

#### BEN

Um, ["Behind the Bastards"](https://www.iheart.com/podcast/105-behind-the-bastards-29236323/). It's very good.

#### TIM

Oh, yeah, it'll make you real cross.

#### BEN

Makes you very cross. But it's good information, if a little bit American centric, but, you know, they're American. As if everything else on the internet.

#### TIM

As is every*one*, actually. If you check, everyone's an American. It's weird.

This one's from Moose! Moose asks:

> Now that the series has come to a close, what's your favourite memory from recording Stellar Firma?

#### BEN

Never having to record with my brother ever again.

#### TIM

It's gonna be a great memory, never having to remember that ever again, isn't it?

#### BEN

Yes.

#### TIM

Do you want an emotionally open and honest answer, or do you wanna keep on this masculine bull**[bleep]**?

#### BEN

I have a terrible memory, so I don't have a specific favourite memory?

#### TIM

Wow. Wow. Wow.

#### BEN

I... No, what! That's just, you know.

#### TIM

Three years, wow.

#### BEN

That's my brain falling apart, to be honest.

#### TIM

Like a wet cake.

#### BEN

No, I just really enjoyed all of it, to be honest. Like, it's just fun. It's just been really fun.

#### TIM

Enjoyed all of it. It's like a crap best man speech. "You know what I love most about Mark? All of it. Anyway, to the bride and groom..."

#### BEN

I mean, you spent most of my best man speech complaining, so....

#### TIM

And it was an excellent best man speech. Highlight of the wedding? That's not for me to say. That's for the people to chant. They're like, "Tim should get married to the concept of being great! That's what should happen," they all chanted.

#### BEN

So how about your memory, Tim? Your specific memory that you're definitely gonna come up with?

#### TIM

I have one. I really enjoyed it when Erin came in to record, and just immediately sat down and started discussing how they had farted so badly they had to leave all of the doors and windows of their car open while they went to a shop. And then I said, "We are recording this," and they said something along the lines of like, "I don't **[bleep]**ing care." That was one of the--

Yeah, that, and probably a recording with Jenny, when were doing the-- I think this might have been in studio? Or was it over Zoom? It was one of the training sessions, and it was either the chicken, grain, and fox one, or the D&D one.

#### BEN

The Planets and Protagonists episode was great.

#### TIM

The recording of that, 'cause we were all three of us in this studio.

#### BEN

Having a bunch of fun.

#### TIM

Having a bunch of fun. And it was very much like, "Cool, I'm being paid to do this, this is awesome."

#### BEN

This is from noblessejess:

> Looking back on the series, is there anything you would change?

#### TIM

The actor that plays David.

#### BEN

He's talking about me.

#### TIM

I'd like to get-- Who would I like for David? I'd like Gilbert Gottfreid. "Trexel!"

#### BEN

"I'm a clone!" Mine is the actor who play __[mumbles].__

#### TIM

And who would you get to replace them?

#### BEN

Actually, I think you could do a good thing of a Matt Berry/Richard Ayoade vehicle. You know, really going back to like the Channel 4, sort of goth in dark place, sort of Mighty Boosh era-- Which was on BBC but not, you know. But that sort of thing, I think you'd get a good one out of.

#### TIM

I think a weird Hollywood adaptation with Matt Berry and Richard Ayoade would be a lot of fun.

#### BEN

I don't think either of those actors have the clout to get a Hollywood adaptation. They very much exist in the "Fun on British TV." Matt Berry with a little bit of, um--

#### TIM

When he [Richard Ayoade] directed *Submarine* and got a little bit more profile, he was in that awful Ben Stiller comedy, which isn't his fault. He was quite good in it. Called [*The Watch*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1298649/?ref_=nm_knf_t3) or something. It was like the local neighborhood watch. I think it might have been called *Neighborhood Watch.*

#### BEN

Oooh, yes, I remember that.

#### TIM

And that was like a big production that didn't do very well. I also don't think he particularly enjoyed Hollywood because it's awful.

Is there anything you would change? Umm, pff.

#### BEN

It might give you a bit of thinking time. Like, being honest, I don't know yet. I don't think I've had enough space from it to start to be able to break down-- Like broadly, I'm quite proud of what we did? I think it was pretty good. It definitely wasn't perfect. So I'm sure there will be stuff, "Oh we could change that," but I don't have anything specific at the moment.

#### TIM

I thought it was perfect... Uh, no. Yeah, I think I'm in a similar boat. It seems a bit of a cop-out answer, but currently I'm just-- I was just focused on getting it over the line.

#### BEN

Yeah.

#### TIM

And I'm sure in a year's time I'll be like, ahh, I wish we'd done this, or I wish we'd done that. I think I wish we'd maybe--

Maybe what I'd changed is something that'd be impossible to change. Which is, having done a season before we did the first season? Just so we could work out some of the kinks? But how the hell's that supposed to work?

#### BEN

I've thought of something as well. Having more guests.

#### TIM

Yes, absolutely. You'll notice we got more guests towards the end, 'cause it makes it more fun.

#### BEN

And also, 'cause it was pointed out, "Hello, Stellar Firma is an awful lot of just two white men shouting? Uhh, can you mix it up a little bit?" and we were like yes, yes, that's a good point.

#### TIM

'Cause as much as we made all the ancillary characters either women or nonbinary or what have you, in the end of the day, it was Tim and Ben Meredith yelling for 90% of the show.

#### BEN

Yeah. Yeah.

#### TIM

This one is frommmmm... Raspberry Heaven:

>What was the process for creating the songs for Cabaret Night at the Cosmic Lounge?

#### BEN

Well, I can answer this question!

#### TIM

Ben, please.

#### BEN

So, I was like, *(J. Jonah Jameson voice)* "Tim! Bring me songs of David 7!"

#### TIM

Yeah.

#### BEN

And then Tim went away and brought me pictures of Spider-Man? I didn't want that. I wanted songs of David 7. __[Tim laughs]__

#### TIM

I got a cigar stubbed out on my arm so many times.

#### BEN

It's why I keep one lit next to me at all times. I don't smoke them, I just need them for stubbing out on Tim's forearms.

#### TIM

No, you've actually got a little vacuum pump, just to sort of like suck air and just gently keep it alive. It's very elaborate for what is quite a cruel joke.

#### TIM

Yeah, it was very much I started messing around on Garage Band, and needed a thing to focus on--

'Cause obviously there's a load of singing in the show, loads of Trexel singing in the show, people are like, 'oh, you should do songs.' And then I was like, oh, I could try to make songs, oh, I'm awful at it, but I can sort of hammer it into some sort of shape and, uh, and then big daddy production dollars Alex turned up, and we took those demos to a production team that I know and I do improv with. I am performing with both of them in the Fringe. One on the desks, one on the guitar. And we sort of hammered it into shape. They went away and did a huge amount of instrumentation, a bit of rewrites--

Yeah, it was a lot of, it was a lot of fun. You know what? I would like to do another one if we can. I think there's a possibility that we can do some more of that, either directly with Stellar Firma or with something else, because again, there's a lot of I did so much of it on my own without knowing what the hell I was doing, and then later, bigger boys came in and like, took me by the shoulder and said, "Okay, step away from the keyboard. We're gonna sort this out for you now because this is all wrong." Yeah. That was, that was roughly how it happened.

#### BEN

Uh, so, this question is from Sandyxandy, or Sandy Xandy.

#### TIM

I think go with Sandy Xandy.

#### BEN

Sandy Xandy.

#### TIM

It's a lot of fun.

#### BEN

> How are Enola, Harry, and Akteraks doing?

We know how Harry's doing.

#### TIM

Yeah.

#### BEN

Harry is locked in a...

#### TIM

If you've listened to the finale--

#### BEN

Oh, that's true! This has been written before people know. So we do now know--

#### TIM

You know what's happened with Harry and Enola. Enola's got a post-credit sequence. If you're listening to this and being like, "No they didn't," listen to the after the credits and give us our dues, because there is a post-credits sequence that I wrote. Akteraks? Couldn't tell you. Evacuated. Evacuated in some form, I imagine.

#### BEN

Yeah, Akteraks would have been evacuated along with everybody else. I mean, unless, unless she had too much work to do and wouldn't leave her desk, and then... burst.

#### TIM

And then died, yeah. And then died.

#### BEN

Maybe, maybe. I mean, Akteraks was alright. I think she did have one of the more overtly evil jobs.

#### TIM

Yeah, yeah. Just because she was a bit--

#### BEN

But seemed like a decent person, just doing their job? Now obviously, "I was just doing my job..."

#### TIM

We get into a banality of evil very quickly.

#### BEN

Yeah, yeah, exactly. I mean, I don't know. For living in that system, she was probably no better or worse than most of the people in Stellar Firma.

#### TIM

Yeah, but people sure wanted to wife her, and we'll always have Paris.

Here's a question from Moose:

>Is there a new project you're working on, or is it a fully fleshed production of Time Bots™?

Now, I don't know when this is coming out, but I am hoping to do a little Time Bots episode. Only a small one, but we did-- The concept of Time Bots tickled us greatly, and we think at least a trailer for that would forthcoming.

But in terms of what next, because there are definitely plans to do something, we're not planning to finish this and shake hands and all walk in three different directions. Yeah, there's definitely a couple of ideas that we're working on. Probably, you know, it's going to have a not too dissimilar format in terms of small group improv, 'cause that is a format that we really like, and I am certainly not scripting things. So unless they provide me with a writer, and-- And at that stage I'm just being cast in a different thing.

We are working on it, Moose.

#### BEN

So I've got a question here from Daniel:

> How often did you have to stop and redo a scene because someone forgot Stellar Firma only serves slurry?

#### TIM

Hundreds of times, and we still missed it a load of times.

#### BEN

Yep, yep. It's just fun talking about food. It turns out-- There you go. That's something I would change.

#### TIM

We would change that. Just let them have food.

#### BEN

We could just have food. The slurry was like a fun one-off gag which we then were like, like a millstone around our necks. I should have said only clones eat slurry, and then everyone else can't.

#### TIM

Yeah, could have been. 'Cause we ended up having little exceptions, like the clients had food, and so you could steal food from the client kitchens. And in David 7's café, he sold muffins, but the muffins were just slurry compressed into the shape of muffins.

#### BEN

We kind of-- Slurry's applications kind of grew and grew. I mean, fundamentally, it's like, it was just gonna be like a grey goo in a bowl. And then we were like, well, that's boring. You know, especially since we've got alcoholic slurry that's just drink. And also the inconsistency of, 'we only eat slurry,' [__TIM:__ And also alcohol.] but there's *SO MANY* varieties of normal alcohol.

#### TIM

Why? Who could say?

#### BEN

Yeah, you can't get a roll, but you can get whisky.

#### TIM

Yeah. And pink gin. What's going on?

#### BEN

Hm. And cocktails. So many cocktails.

#### TIM

Yeah, so, I'm glad that we had that question, because it gave us an answer to a question earlier that we didn't have an answer for. That bloody thing. Have food, please.

Nix has asked:

>Was Trexel's empathy arc always an intended plot point?

No. In season three, we knew that we needed to give him a little bit of-- am I using the word 'pathos' correctly?

#### BEN

Uhhhh... yes?

#### TIM

Yeah. But we, we wanted to very much straddle the line, because we didn't want to, and hope we didn't end up doing, was giving Trexel a redemption arc. [__BEN:__ Yeah.] And if you've listened to the final episode, he did not sacrifice himself; he made a mistake. Y'know, he is not a good person, but y'know, having some thoughts for other people's feelings that he did not change and get better as a person because people don't.

#### BEN

Yeah, and like, that's it. I really don't like narratives where it's too clean. Where everyone is like, oh, we've all learned a lesson, and we're all fine. It's just not how real life works.

#### TIM

No, Trexel's very much a product of his environment. And, you know, in-universe time, six weeks or so with a clone would not change a whole lifetime's worth of learnt behaviour.

#### BEN

Yeah, and, sure, you can discuss like, how much is Trexel a product of his own environment. Obviously he went through some extremely traumatic experiences as a child.

#### TIM

[The meat pile with the note saying 'earn it.'](https://stellarscripts.github.io/stellar_firma_transcripts/episode/011.html)

#### BEN

Yeah, exactly, like, lots and lots of stuff like that. So, you know, that's a question, that's like, nature vs nurture, which is not a question that I think anyone really has an answer to.

#### TIM

It's probably, accidentally, the deepest question we have asked in all of Stellar Firma, and we didn't intend to ask it.

#### BEN

Uhh... I don't think it's that fair to us to say that we didn't intend to ask it, because it's a character thread that we found interesting. Like sure, we didn't sit down and go "What is the brief of Trexel's character," but that's the fundamental thing about Trexel is like-- To be honest, it's that you get to shout with his funny voice is really the point of Trexel's character.

#### TIM

Ben, come on. Don't, don't [unintelligible].

#### BEN

Tim, Tim, we built a show around exactly that.

#### TIM

And I hope to build many more. Look forward to new characters, such as Drexel. 'Hello, I'm different!' Crexel. 'I'm also a different person! I've got a hat.'

I think we'll take one final question. And this is from Antony. Antony says:

> I know you said you started Stellar Firma was the excuse to make time to regularly spend together. Has doing the recordings from home sort of sucked the fun out of it, or are you still getting what you wanted from it-- spending time together, presumably weekly, and now that it's over, are you going to be looking at doing other projects together.

I know we've answered that last one, but I think an interesting point on the first one-- because yes, the whole point of starting Stellar Firma in the first place is because we're awful, awful people who are terrible at keeping in contact with each other, despite the fact we like each other a reasonable amount.

#### BEN

But we need projects and deadlines.

#### TIM

We needs projects. Because if it's like, 'oh, I'll just go spend time with Ben,' I realise it's been six weeks and I've forgot to text him.

#### BEN

Yep, yep.

#### TIM

So, yes, and that was really, really fun in the early days. But I don't know about you, Ben, but I think... Quite apart from sucking the fun out of it, once we got used to it, recording remotely has actually worked really well.

#### BEN

Yeah.

#### TIM

And given everything that's going on, a nice excuse to be forced under even more difficult circumstances to spend time with each other. 'Cause both Ben and I despise the Zoom hangout. I don't, ugh. I think we're not alone in thinking it's very, very difficult to just be like, 'Let's just get onto Teams or Skype or Zoom and just have a chat.' It gets very quiet very quickly.

#### BEN

Not a small talker. Not a small talker.

#### TIM

Neither of us. We do big talk. We do massive talk.

And so, having a project to drape over that format means that we come, we have a catchup, we have a chat, we mess around, and then we do the episode, and then we have a bit of a debrief, and then the streaming as well. Very similarly.

So I think although it's not quite the same as you're getting in a studio together, given everything that's going on, I'm really realy glad we had Stellar Firma as a thing to do before the world went weird. Because without it, I think we probably wouldn't have spoken all that much in the last year. And that would have been very sad.

#### BEN

Probably not. And like, yeah, and there's definitely like-- It definitely at all hasn't sucked the fun out of it. And there is definitely like, with all performance, being in the room with the people obviously gives it an element which you don't get online, which is the physical element.

#### TIM

I think Luc Besson calls it the Fifth Element.

#### BEN

Ahhh. That was what it was. It was... tables. Fire, water, earth, air, and tables.

#### TIM

Tables. Tables for Ben to hit on his microphone.

#### BEN

Shut up. But no, I think, like-- and it's been really good that it worked remotely. Not only because it let us finish Stellar Firma, but also means that, you know, any future projects that we have, kind of doesn't matter where we are.

#### TIM

Helped with guests, as well. We're in Brighton.

#### BEN

Really helped with guests. 'Cause you can get people who don't live in Brighton.

#### TIM

Yeah, and it was like, what are we supposed to do? We're two of us in the recording studio, and we Skype the third person? What a ridiculous thing, that would never work! And then we had to, and Rusty Quill were like, "Right, we've bought remote recording kits that we will mail to people," and all a sudden, Annie's from the US, and Jenny recorded from home.

#### BEN

Y'know, and Maddy.

#### TIM

Yeah, Maddy.

#### BEN

We got Alex in externally.

#### TIM

There is a whole story because we didn't realise until afterwards two of us were on cardioid mics, one of us was on a dynamic mic, and that's part of the reason that Maddy has a vocal effect on her. Which actually, again, a wonderful example of constraints creating better ideas. The idea of re-recording was so onerous to everybody, because re-recording improv and trying to make it vaguely the same is possibly the worst thing you can ever, ever do. And so having to think, well, what can we do with the vocals? And then that whole sort of, Vice-Admiral Fun sort of broadcasting over a hologram from an empty studio somewhere deep in the bowels of the ship.

#### BEN

It's the same thing for Akteraks. Because Annie doesn't have a dedicated recording space.

#### TIM

Had to record it in a cupboard.

#### BEN

So she used a cupboard, which was quite echoey.

#### TIM

A cupboard, and a cupboard in which the laptop wouldn't go. So she set up the laptop, started recording it, and then closed the cupboard door with cables.

#### BEN

Just alone with a microphone.

#### TIM

So could just hear us, but couldn't see us. It was a very strange.

#### BEN

But then we had the fun image of Akteraks just on a little TV screen on wheels.

#### TIM

Just an iPad on wheels.

#### BEN

Oh, which is a lot of fun.

#### TIM

And we wouldn't have written that. We sort of just-- We're forced into being better.

#### BEN

Yeah, 'cause I think that was genuinely one of the ones where we were talking to Annie before the recording, and she was like, "This is about as good as it's getting." We're like, okaaay.

#### TIM

We'll just have to see how this goes. 'Cause, in fact, we went to go record first time, and it was like, very, very, bad echoey room. And then we went a second time with the cupboard solution, and it was a little bit better. But it all worked out! People loved her.

#### BEN

Yeah, yeah, very good.

#### TIM

Okay, well, I think that's all we've got time for. Unless you have any others that you're burning to answer, Ben?

#### BEN

Ooh, ooh, we've got one that I think is just for you. And it's just a little coda.

#### TIM

Oh, lovely.

#### BEN

A little final question.

> How many of the jokes about people who work in marketing are about Callum?

And this is asked by... Callum, the chief marketing officer of Rusty Quill.

#### TIM

Well, I don't think anything was some sort of pointed jibe. But I think we all know that the art of marketing has a few foibles that we like to wryly poke fun at. No, this wasn't some sort of character assassination attempt.

#### BEN

I mean, you know, we have to remember, of course, Tim works in recruitment. Which is another one of those industries--

#### TIM

I work in recruitment. I work in sales, mate.

#### BEN

You don't.

#### TIM

I am very lucky to work for a very nice company in a nice part of the business. I am aware of other recruitment companies where it's like working in the seventh circle of hell, because that's sales.

#### BEN

Well... Trexel's Ten-Step Program for Ultimate Sales Domination is based on...

#### TIM

Directly cribbed from actual sales training I have been through. Not all of it, you know. At no point did somebody say "pretend you're dying to get them on your side." But not as far away as you'd want from some of the things that are taught. I'd say, I hasten to add, not with my current company, they're a nice bunch, but in previous jobs and in previous trainings. Little bit of that. Little bit of soul destroying sales training. So mostly, as with, well, I suppose most of Stellar Firma, it's just a way of yelling into the void, I've found. I don't know about you, Ben. A cathartic yell into the void.

#### BEN

Well, I didn't get to do much yelling. But more sort of screeching into the void, I think.

#### TIM

Yeah, so the honking into the void for Ben.

##### [they honk questionably at each other]

#### BEN

Things are bad! __[high pitched ghost honking]__

#### TIM

I'm not a ghost, but I could be!

##### [they do a strange warbling ghost honk at each other]

#### BEN

Goodbye, everybody! Gooooodbyyyyye!

#### TIM

Oh, well, as Ben's already... _(laughing)_ said goodbye, I think we shall finish it there. So thank you so much for joining us for this Season 3 Q&A. We will see you all another time. Bye!
