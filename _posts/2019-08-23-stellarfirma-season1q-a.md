##### [shorter version of the show theme]

#### TIM

Hello, and welcome to the Stellar Firma season 1 Q&A. Ah! What a season, Ben. What a season. What are your thoughts?

#### BEN

What a season. Uh, it's seasoned.

#### TIM

Yep.

#### BEN

It was-- Lot of pepper, __[Tim agrees]__ a nice bit of salt--

#### TIM

Cayenne? _(pronounced K-Eye-ANN)_

#### BEN

A little bit of...Cayenne? _(pronounced KAY-En)_

#### TIM

Cayenne?

#### BEN

Cayenne.

#### TIM

No. I colour my food with cayenne, which I believe is turquoise. I'm very ill a lot of the time.

#### BEN

Do you mean cyan...?

#### TIM

I do?

#### BEN

Yes.

#### TIM

I do mean cyan?

#### BEN

This is a very-- And that is how the season went.

#### TIM

__[laughs]__ And the season went. Somebody confidently saying a joke and then realising they were wrong. __[Ben laughs]__ That's pretty much-- __[laughs]__

#### BEN

Nailed it. Absolutely.

#### TIM

Pretty much. So we've got a lot of questions. Loads, loads of questions. Oh, more questions than we could possibly handle... except we will. We've got a lot of questions here from the fans. From the fanbase. From the screaming hordes that are outside the studio at all times. __[Ben snorts]__ Very thick windows. You can't hear them, but they are there. Don't check. So let's-- let's push-- Should we...?

#### BEN

Should we take it in turns?

#### TIM

Let's take it in turns.

#### BEN

Shall I say the first one?

#### TIM

Yeah, you take the first one, but I'll probabl-- Almost certainly interrupt you. Just, you know.

#### BEN

It is you.

#### TIM

It is me.

#### BEN

Okay. So we've got the first one. It's from Lunaticpoet who is asking, 

>"Who is more chaotic: Ben or Tim?" 

Well, since I asked the question, maybe you get the first answer.

#### TIM

I am.

#### BEN

I actually disagree.

#### TIM

Really?

#### BEN

Yes.

#### TIM

Really? I suppose I'm louder.

#### BEN

Yeah, at that.

#### TIM

I'm loud and more aggressive.

#### BEN

I would never, never-- Yeah, so I think we are both chaotic in our own special, *special* ways. I am more subversive.

#### TIM

Yes.

#### BEN

Tim is loud.

#### TIM

I think, and this isn't an insult, I think probably because you are slightly less experienced in improv than I am.

#### BEN

_(sarcastic)_ How dare you.

#### TIM

I will often try and make choices that are... I suppose you'd call them actively supportive, which is fine. You often will make comments which are...

#### BEN

Negative.

#### TIM

Negative!

#### BEN

Shut everything down.

#### TIM

Shut everything down! But the thing is because I'm _(sultry voice)_ *such a seasoned improviser,* __[Ben makes a sound like he's catching onto Tim's point, Tim clears his throat loudly]__ I just enjoy-- It's fun to have that character 'cause you can say no whilst also being a yes as long as the other a person, sort of, you know--

#### BEN

I think they were talking about that in the discord. Apparently, my style is 'No, so'. __[chuckles]__

#### TIM

No, so! Yeah, yeah that's fine. Like a 'No, but' is absolutely fine as long as you all agree, because, as we know, every single rule in improv is helpful right up until the point it strangles you to death.

#### BEN

It's like GCSE physics.

#### TIM

It's like GCSE physics. Learn things wrong so that you can learn [__BEN:__ Anything at all.] other more complicated wrong things later, [__BEN:__ Yeah.] until eventually you kind of get near the truth but still not really.

#### BEN

So, in summation, we are a chaotic force the like of which the world has never seen.

#### TIM

Exactly. Noncommittal. Right, the next question is from E. Forney: 

>"Especially for Ben--"

#### BEN

Ha! That's me.

#### TIM

That's you. _(resumes reading)_ 

>"--Since he's been on multiple Rusty Quill podcasts, [__BEN:__ I'm everywhere.] how does doing Stellar Firma (which is 'semi-improvised')"-- 

Semi-improvised in quotes there. Kind of a bit sarcastic, but okay-- _(resumes reading)_ 

>"compared to Magnus Archives (mostly? all? scripted) and RQGaming (all/mostly improvised)"-- 

There's a lot of subclauses in that question, Ben.

#### BEN

Well, I mean, let's actually-- we can put some of these to bed. Stellar Firma is, except for the intros and outros, entirely improvised,[__TIM:__ Yes...] which is semi-improvised, and then Magnus Archives is all scripted. [__TIM:__ Yep.]As far as I know. Unless Jonny's riffing some fat beats of words.

#### TIM

Riffing some cosmic horror beats.

#### BEN

_(stilted)_ Yep. And RQG Gaming is-- Yeah. Oh no, RQ Gaming, god we have such a bad-- Alex is probably gonna edit that out, but genuinely __[Tim laughs]__ Rusty Quill Gaming Podcast is a terrible name. We didn't know what we were doing. It is all mostly improvised.

#### TIM 

__[still laughing]__ It'll be David editing this, as well.

#### BEN

David, leave that in.

#### TIM

Leave that in. __[laughs]__

##### [the audio gets fuzzy and staticky]

#### BEN

Make it louder.

#### TIM

Make it louder.

##### [distortion stops]

#### BEN

How does it differ? It differs in the way that you said? It's-- like, Magnus Archives, I just turn up, I read the words, and then Alex will tell me to read the words differently until he's happy with the way that I've read the words and then I go away. Rusty Quill Gaming and Stellar Firma are different because, although they are improvised, they have very, very different objectives. Rusty Quill Gaming is slower, less frantic, and much more focused on pushing the story forward and developing the characters. __[Tim hums]__ Whereas, Stellar Firma is the kind of improvisation which is, you know, it's more, sort of, short-form fundamentally, and at least compared to the 150 hours of [__TIM:__ Yes.] __[chuckles]__ RQ Gaming--

#### TIM

Let's call it shorter form, 'cause it is long-form in the improv--

#### BEN

It's-- Yeah. It's long-form-- Yeah.

#### TIM

--but it's shorter form narrative.

#### BEN

Yeah, and that's just really focused on the goofs and the energy, so it's actually-- I guess it's the energy levels. [__TIM:__ Yeah.] Magnus is lowest energy because, although we have fun, it's not about building yourself up, it's about doing what you need to do. RQ Gaming is medium energy because you have to keep it sustainable. Otherwise, we'd all just die. And Stellar Firma is just 100% unlock the floodgates. Let's go, let's go, let's go until we stop.

#### TIM

Yeah, let the editor pick the bones out of that! __[laughs]__

#### BEN

Yeah, exactly. You've heard the bloopers. You know what we're like.

#### TIM

Oh, yeah. You know what it's like. You know what? That is such a small fraction of the bloopers as well. __[laughs]__

#### BEN

My gosh, there's just so many.

#### TIM

I mean, it's the bloopers that you'd want to hear because there's a lot of like, "Oh, I've done that wrong."

#### BEN

Yeah. It's the good ones. Right, so this is from planetsandmagic. Bonjour planets.

#### TIM

Bonjour planets!

#### BEN

>"I was wondering, what got you guys into improv? Any tips for those who're interested but without any experience?" 

We chose this well. Tim, would you like to field this? [__TIM:__ Uhh--] No, actually, I can sum this up. How did I get into improv? Uh, Tim got me into it.

#### TIM

I did.

#### BEN

There you go.

#### TIM

I did. Like getting someone into drugs. First taste was free, then the next taste was also free because there's no money in any of it. I got into improv at university because I was shy and didn't know-- I was quite shy and retiring. I was a quite shy and retiring person.

#### BEN

Yeah, you were. He went into university and came out a completely different, much louder person.

#### TIM

Nine grand well spent! __[Ben laughs]__ So yeah, so I was sort of shy and didn't know people and then somebody I knew did improv and invited me along and I got into it and was like, "Oh, cool! These are also shy idiots that are also on stage, so--"

#### BEN

One of whom was Alexander J Newall.

#### TIM

One of these shy idiots was Alexander J-est Newall. And my now-other-half was-- taught me improv and claims to have taught me everything I knew. I don't think that's true but, you know, let's-- she'll never hear this. She doesn't listen. No, she's now on the show so she might. Okay, you know what? She's correct. So, I got into it that way.

"Any tips for those who're interested but without any experience?" It's gonna sound very trite but just start doing it. There's no entry requirement really other than don't be an ass. And also, especially if you're in somewhere like London where there's lots of groups, don't be afraid to try a few. 'Cause I get the feeling people join an improv group and they're like, "Ah, this is everything that improv can be." And improv is very, very different from group to group and you can get into it and think it's one thing. _(quieter)_ *And, you know-- you know, don't tell anyone but you might join a group that turned out to be crap* _(normal)_ because that does sometimes happen. You know, there are improv groups out there that are fine, and you could probably do better in another one. So, you know, just shop around. Be a mercenary. Have no friends or commitments and wait until you hop on a gravy train of some kind.

My answer really got away from me there. Okay. __[laughs]__ So, so in short, just do it and if you don't like something, leave.

#### BEN

Yeah, the sunk cost fallacy is real.

#### TIM

Yes. Oh yeah. I've never got into it too badly myself, but I definitely know, like a-- When I was doing university improv, it felt like the extent of the universe. And then after it was like, "Oh, this was a tiny little corner."

#### BEN

It's the same thing as student theatre. It's no different. [__TIM:__ Yeah.] You do theatre when you're a student and you think it's the best thing ever and then you look back on it when you've seen some real people do real theatre and you're like, [__TIM:__ Oh, no.] "My god, we were crap!" __[Tim laughs]__ It was an important and [__TIM:__ Yeah.] formative experience, [__TIM:__ Oh, sure.] but you ain't hit your zenith [__TIM:__ Exactly.] when you're doing, you know, bloody--

#### TIM

Shakespeare in the Park.

#### BEN

--Stoppard or something. Yeah.

#### TIM

Is that a thing? Shakespeare in the Park?

#### BEN

Shakespeare in the Park, yeah, but lots of professionals do Shakespeare in the Park.

#### TIM

_(sarcastic)_ No, only students.

#### BEN

Okay.

#### TIM

Um, next question. From Miri: 

>"How much does the David 7/Trexel dynamic reflect your real-life sibling dynamic? Do you really want to put David in a vacuum tube?" 

Ben, what do you think?

#### BEN

No. Not at all.

#### TIM

No. Not even slightly 'cause that would be a-- we would not be friends. __[laughs]__

#### BEN

Yeah, that's true. Yeah, we're not as abusive to each other [__TIM:__ No.] in, you know, I don't try and gaslight Tim all the time. [__TIM:__ No. No.] And Tim doesn't __[chuckles]__ roll in and try and get me killed [__TIM:__ Yeah.] while being an alcoholic?

#### TIM

Yeah, I *rarely* threaten you.

#### BEN

Rarely.

#### TIM

Rarely.

#### BEN

Sometimes.

#### TIM

Sometimes, sure. Like when we-- like, normally when we're trying to complete a task and we're both tired and __[both laugh]__ at that point we become really aggressive. But yeah, we're pretty chill.

#### BEN

Yeah.

#### TIM

We didn't get on-- the only time we really didn't get on was when you were just about to go to university.

#### BEN

Yeah. It turns out when we were both awful teenagers, [__TIM:__ Yeah.] you're just horrible. __[snorts]__

#### TIM

An awful person. But, yeah, since you went away and we, you know, was able to--

#### BEN

_(old-person voice)_ "I came back from the university wars!"

#### TIM 

__[laughs]__ You came back from the Sussex campus battle. Yeah, so no. In short, no.

#### BEN

From Bittercape: 

>"Have you ever met anyone in a professional setting who knows you from Stellar Firma?"

#### TIM

No. I have people in a professional setting that now know I do Stellar Firma. So, like, some people at my work listen. Like one of my bosses listens and it's weird when he brings stuff up from the podcast. __[Ben snorts]__ Like, he'll just say, "What did you mean by this?" And I'll be like, "Well, the answer is nothing but um... __[Ben laughs]__ now let's have a meeting." So, so yeah. No, I've never encountered anyone who's like, "Hey, you sound like that guy from the podcast." So, yeah. Currently not. Hopefully soon.

#### BEN

Yeah, well, that's the thing. Yeah, me neither, because I've been in my job I think basically as long as I've been doing Rusty Quill. So, you know, I've not met anyone new who's been like, "Ah, you're that guy." Also, 'cause, you know _(whispers)_ *we're not that famous*.

#### TIM

No. No.

#### BEN

_(whispers)_ In any stretch of the imagination.

#### TIM

We're pretty famous.

#### BEN 

_(whispers)_ We're not. We're not at all. We're not at all.

#### TIM

Yeah, like we're--

#### BEN

_(whispers)_ It's nice that you think we might be but we're not. __[Tim laughs]__ And that's why you have to tell more people--

#### TIM

You have to tell more people.

#### BEN

--about our podcast and make us extremely famous.

#### TIM

Yeah. Solid growth, sure. Not quite there, not quite a *Magnus* level. The thing is--

#### BEN

I wanna find the McElroy Brothers and stand on top of them.

#### TIM

Yeah, stand upon the shoulders of the McElroys.

#### BEN

Be like, "You seem nice boys but I'm better than you." That's what I want to do.

#### TIM

Well, the thing is they're three and we're a two. Streamlined.

#### BEN

So, we're more concentrated brothers

#### TIM

Concentrated. Consommé brothers.

#### BEN

A thin soup of brothers.

#### TIM

A thin soup of brothers.

#### BEN

Yeah, no. I'm still waiting for it 'cause I work in the games industry which has loads of nerds. [__TIM:__ Yeah.] So, I'm hoping at some point someone's going to be like, "Oh, aren't you that villain from *Magnus*?" and I will be like, "Heh, yes."

#### TIM

"Yeah, yes I am."

#### BEN

__[laughs]__ But not yet. 

From Calodette: 

>"Who would you fight on the show, and why?"

#### TIM

Who would I fight on the show?

#### BEN

Trexel 'cause he deserves it.

#### TIM

Yeah, Trexel 'cause he deserves it. __[laughs]__ Like, you know, the Board-- they'd arrange for you to be killed, Hartro I think would, I don't know, demote--

#### BEN

Stick her foot in your mouth.

#### TIM

Stick her foot in the mouth. I mean, maybe you're into that, I don't know. But, yeah--

#### BEN

Hartro certainly is.

#### TIM

Yeah, Hartro is. And I think Trexel secretly is. But yeah, Trexel's a monster and he needs to be stopped.

#### BEN

Yeah.

#### TIM

Yeah.

#### BEN

Yeah. Fundamentally.

#### TIM

Straight forward.

#### BEN

With a sympathetic backstory but--

#### TIM

I mean, sure--

#### BEN

--does not excuse the things that he does.

#### TIM

No, the thing is, I have had a fair bit of involvement in people who have gone through therapy and different things and dealing with disability and all those things, and one of the earliest lessons is "no matter how tragic and sad and understandable your backstory is, does not give you permission to be an ass." __[laughs]__ Like, you can be cross, you can be angry but the minute you start, you know, endangering other peoples' lives, doesn't matter. You can go screw yourself. __[laughs]__ Is that okay, "screw yourself"?

#### BEN

I think "screw yourself" is fine.

#### TIM

Yeah, okay. We're moving onto questions that are more about the production side [__BEN:__ Ooohhh.] of, you know, the-- I think what people really want to know when they're listening to a good show is "What's the best boy?" "What does the gaffer do?" And that's what these questions are about.

#### BEN

Oh, I thought you were talking about which one of us was the best 'cause *I am* the best boy.

#### TIM

No, I'm-- no, I am the best boy.

#### BEN

No, I'm the best boy.

#### TIM

I'm the best boy.

#### BEN

I'm pretty sure I'm the best boy.

#### TIM

How about this: I'm best boy, you're best *guy*.

#### BEN

...I'll take it.

#### TIM

Okay. __[chuckles]__ You're slightly older. 

Okay, so, from Bittercape: 

>"What was the original pitch for Stellar Firma?"

#### BEN

Uhhh... Oh, yes! What was the original pitch for Stellar Firma?

#### TIM

I remember the original title.

#### BEN

What was that?

#### TIM

Well, okay. There was two original pitches.

#### BEN

_(interrupts)_ World Builders!

#### TIM

Yes, World Builders. So--

#### BEN

It was a terrible title. [__TIM:__ Yeah.] I'm glad we changed it.

#### TIM

Look, we were literally-- So, we were hiking.

#### BEN

We were. We were walking to Lewes.

#### TIM

We were walking to Lewes across the South Downs. Along the South Downs Way.

#### BEN

Because we are, in fact, in an Enid Blyton novel.

#### TIM

Yes, yes, we're-- marmalade sandwiches and--

#### BEN

_(English countryside accent)_ "We took our pic-i-nic and our lovely little dog Spotty Boy."

#### TIM

"And I had some scotched eggs." __[Ben laughs]__ Yeah, yeah, so we were wandering around the English countryside and thinking, "Ah, it'd be nice to do a podcast together."

#### BEN

Yeah. I think--

#### TIM

We're white men--

#### BEN

Well, yes.

#### TIM

--let's do a podcast!

#### BEN

We had to do a podcast.

#### TIM

It's the law.

#### BEN

We're in our, you know, late twenties, it's basically--

#### TIM

Uh, mid-twenties, Ben.

#### BEN

Aw, man.

#### TIM

Twenty-six.

#### BEN

Twenty-nine.

#### TIM

Ha! You'll be dead soon.

#### BEN

Unfair. I will be dead soon. It's *Logan's Run* all over again.

#### TIM

__[laughs]__ It's *Logan's*-- Yeah, we've all got these crystals embedded in my hands.

#### BEN

Yeah, so, I think-- So I suggested it 'cause I think I was-- I was thinking, you know, I'd like to hang out with my brother. I'm genuinely aware that that is why the McElroy's started [__TIM:__ Sure.] The Adventure Zone 'cause they wanted to hang out with their dad. And I was like, "This is a great idea! [__TIM:__ Yeah.] Just hang out with your family and record content."

#### TIM

Yeah. Yeah.

#### BEN

And I was like, "Okay, well, I'm a game designer and Tim's an improver so why don't--"

#### TIM

Improviser.

#### BEN

Impro-- Improviser. Sorry.

#### TIM

Don't call me an improver.

#### BEN

An improver-- improvosario.

#### TIM

Yeah, okay, I'll take that.

#### BEN

Improvatrix.

#### TIM

Improvatrix. __[Ben laughs]__ I wear leather. __[laughs]__

#### BEN

Squeak squeak.

#### TIM

Squeak squeak.

#### BEN

Squeak squeak.

#### TIM

All that squeaking on the show? That's not foley. __[Ben laughs]__ That's me in my leather catsuit.

#### BEN

So, we do those two things and I was like, "Okay, well why don't we do, sort of, fake world building?" Effectively doing stuff for tabletop RPGs. [__TIM:__ Mm.] So, people would say, "Oh, could you, like, design me a campaign setting?"

#### TIM

Yeah.

#### BEN

And it was going to be a genuine, not-stupid thing. It-- we were actually just going to be like, "Oh, cool, this could be a really good thing to do!" But then we started leaning on, sort of, the idea that Tim could, because of his good improv background, could be getting suggestions out, which is, like, very, very creative and big and then I can provide a sense of reality and actually how things fit together.

#### TIM

And the rules.

#### BEN

Yeah, exactly. So, there you can actually see the start of the Trexel/David 7, sort of, relationship [__TIM:__ Yeah.] of me being the practical, logical one who brings down sort of what Tim is suggesting. Then I think we talked to Alex, right?

#### TIM

Mm, yeah.

#### BEN

And then he asked for a rework to make it more genre-fictiony.

#### TIM

More themed and genre. And, like, I don't think he pushed the sci-fi side of it onto us.

#### BEN

No.

#### TIM

It was very much like, "Well, who would do this? Who would build worlds? Okay, it's Magrathea." Douglas Adams has done it. Yeah. Let's nick it.

#### BEN

_(crosstalk)_ Oh, yeah, Douglas Adams has already done this idea, let's nick it.

#### TIM

Yeah, and like, there is definitely a Douglas Adams-y stuff in there but I think there's a nice mix of, like Douglas Adams-- A lot of it was sort of, kind of a bit Lovecraft-y in the terms of, like, unknowable big forces that don't care about you but might still get you killed.

#### BEN

Well, that's, I mean, *Brazil*.

#### TIM

Yeah, *Brazil*. Yeah, yes, yes. I suppose that's--

#### BEN

Terry Gilliam's *Brazil*.

#### TIM

--I suppose that's dystopian but a lot of my, sort of, background in dystopia stuff other than the classic sci-fi stuff is either *Brazil* or... I do like the Lovecraft settings even though I am aware that Lovecraft is a-- He's a big, old racist.

#### BEN 

__[sighs]__ Well, no, that's-- Yeah, but also it's not dystopic. We're gonna have to get into a big--

#### TIM

Is there-- Oh, sorry-- Is there a difference... I suppose it's not a dystopia because it's--

#### BEN

Yeah, it doesn't describe a socie-- It describes *our* society but then a big monster comes in through reality.

#### TIM

No, no, no, Innsmouth is a society.

#### BEN

It's not a dystopia. __[chuckles]__

#### TIM

I mean, it's not great?

#### BEN 

_(frustrated)_ Hey, but it's not-- _(muffled as though with head in hands)_ Okay...

#### TIM

Hey, don't worry, everybody! Everything's gonna be fine 'cause we're gonna worship our ancient fish god and become ancient fish people--

#### BEN

Actually! The Innsmouth lot are doing perfectly fine and then this guy rocks up and goes, "You're all weird and horrible" but they were just getting on with their deal.

#### TIM

That's true. They should do-- You know, like, *Wicked*? Where it's, like, told from the--

#### BEN

Oh, from the fish people, yeah.

#### TIM

They should just go like, you know, I don't know...

#### BEN

From the perspective of a deep one?

#### TIM

From the 'Inn's mouth', or something like that. __[Ben groans]__ Fun pun. You know, a real fun pun. Like a really good fun pun. And then it's basically--

#### BEN

Alright, so we're gonna try again then?

#### TIM

Yeah, and so--

#### BEN

From the Fin's mouth.

#### TIM

Ooh!! They don't have fins.

#### BEN

That's getting better. Uhh, the deep ones might.

#### TIM

Oh, true. True.

#### BEN

I don't know. This is completely off-topic. Anyways, that was the original pitch for sci-fi--

#### TIM

Stellar Firma.

#### BEN

Sci-fi? Stellar Firma. __[Tim laughs]__ It was basically a Lovecraft version of *Wicked*. And that's--

#### TIM

Yeah, Lovecraft *Wicked*. __[laughs]__

#### BEN

That's how it started.

#### TIM

Aw, I could do the songs! I want to do more songs!

#### BEN 

_(emphatically)_ No! No more Lovecraft fiction. It's overdone and boring and I hate it.

#### TIM

Oh, okay, yeah.

#### BEN

Controversial opinion time. __[Tim laughs]__ Sod it all.[__TIM:__ Yeah.] It's so boring.

#### TIM

It's so boring.

#### BEN

Stop putting tentacles on things and pretending it's good horror. __[Tim laughs]__ That can be edited out if you want or be kept because I'm spitting *home truths*. __[Tim laughs]__ I'm spitting home opinions. [__TIM:__ Home opinions.] This is very much my opinion, but, you know. [__TIM:__ Yeah. Is, um--] Every time there's a blimming Lovecraft Kickstarter it's like _(robotic voice)_ "Funded in three seconds!" It's like __[groans]__ Oh no![__TIM:__ Yeah.]More of it!

#### TIM

And also it's very hard to do 'cause it's like, here's cosmic unknowable horror...now let's try and represent it. It's like mmm--

#### BEN

Well now it's not really-- You don't have to do it well, it's just a bundle of, like, [__TIM:__ Sure.] tropes that you slam together and... Sorry for everyone who likes Lovecraft, but, fundamentally, I hate you.

#### TIM

Yeah, I mean that's...

#### BEN

That's not true.

#### TIM

That's not true. __[laughs]__

#### BEN

You can consume the media that you wish to, but my opinion is no more Lovecraft, please. I'm so done. __[laughs]__

#### TIM

People doing bad versions of a thing you like doesn't make the thing you like bad.

#### BEN

Don't even-- Yes! Yes, that's true. _(mumbles)_ I mean, I don't particularly like Lovecraft. *Whatever.*

#### TIM

_(sarcastic)_ I like his views. __[laughs]__ His racist, *racist* views.

#### BEN 

_(sarcastic)_ Yeah, I'm really into, you know, I don't like his fiction, but his personal life I'm just really supportive of.

#### TIM

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. How everything is secretly about how he doesn't like the Chinese. __[both laugh]__

#### BEN

Yeah. _(emphatically)_ *Or anyone.*

#### TIM

Or anyone!

#### BEN

At least he was an equal opportunities racist.

#### TIM

He was.

#### BEN

Anyway, Owen Shirrel asks: 

>"How did you first come up with the idea for the show?"

#### TIM

Asked and answered.

#### BEN

Yes.

#### TIM 

_(laughing)_ Moving on!

#### BEN

Wait, no no, wait. Hang on. General question basically asked in some form by lots of folks: 

>"How much of the show is improvised, and how much is scripted, planned, or known in advance?"

#### TIM

Oh, that is a separate question by the way.

#### BEN

Yes. Oh, sorry.

#### TIM

So, Owen, apologies, your question has somewhat also already been answered. So it's not that we don't care or love you, and we still will-- it's not your fault. We still love you. _(laughing)_ So the general question. Hey, "How much of the show is improvised, and how much is scripted, planned, or known in advance?" So... The show, basically, from the door opening... at the start... to the door closing at the end... normally one-take improvised. Like, we will edit out mistakes, but it's not like we stop and then go, "Right, how do we do this? How do we do that?"

#### BEN

Well, actually--

#### TIM

It just plows through.

#### BEN

And you have actually heard in the bloopers our process for this, which is, yeah, we won't properly craft it, but we will sometimes stop short and go, "Was that good enough?"

#### TIM

Yeah.

#### BEN

Because we do have the... the luxury of being a recorded medium, so if we tell a joke we think is not funny or a bit dodgy or doesn't actually-- didn't come across as we would like it, we can rerecord it.

#### TIM

It's very nice, 'cause I do a lot of *stage* improv, and in staged improv you can get away with a lot in a live setting because everybody has sort of entered the pact of "This is live. You might say something that isn't the best thing, but we all--" you know, everyone doesn't get up and go, __[mumbles disagreeably]__ "I'm not sure about that." You know, it's just-- It's the pact, whereas as soon as you record it and you start editing things and you start adding things, you may as well go, "I've done a line that I, you know, flubbed the word, came across in a way that I didn't intend it too..." I think a lot of people have noted on the stuff, like-- I think it happens a little bit less overall than it might come across in the bloopers, 'cause obviously, that's a collection of us doing things wrong, but we will do something and go, "Ah, you know what? Now I've said it out loud and it's outside my head, I feel like this might come across badly." __[laughs]__

#### BEN

Yeah, well, it's the kind of thing where onstage you can't unsay things. [__TIM:__ Yeah.] In recorded medium, you can *absolutely* unsay things, so we take advantage of that.

#### TIM

And then release the things you unsaid in a special bloopers episode! __[laughs]__

#### BEN

So that makes it clear that we don't support the things that were unsaid.

#### TIM

Very true. So yeah. So that's sort of all improvised. I will script the... *ends* a little bit. So normally when there's, like, a little bit of David going back and forth between IMOGEN at the end, I'll script that, 'cause that's sort of where the plot really happens and a lot of the driving plot from week-to-week goes on and establishes a lot of that stuff, and you just, you know... You *could* improvise it, but it wouldn't be as good.

#### BEN

Well also, if you've listened to a lot of things that do improvise-- now, like, for example, something like *Hello From the Magic Tavern*, which is *really* good and I listened to like 150 episodes before dropping it-- [__TIM:__ Yes. Couldn't be that bad.] because there's just-- you know, I really enjoy it. But the plot is very loose __[Tim agrees with Ben throughout]__ and as it came to more prominence you started to see the cracks showing of like, "Oh, they're having to improvise this" and I think, you know, this hybrid version manages to keep it tight, without undermining the core improvisational aspect. But fundamentally, what we've done is we do character development in improv. You know, all the stuff about Trexel loving fish or David being slippery, that came up naturally in improv, and we've just run with that as a thing, but we've kind of left the really, really big worldbuilding and plot stuff to scripting so that it can be tight, and we can tell a directed story within that sort of siloed improv setting.

#### TIM

And absolutely stuff that I've scripted has changed because of what we've improvised in the show. [__BEN:__ Yep.] Like, that stuff just changes. Like, I have, and we have, sort of an idea of like, "We're going to go, sort of, from here to here in a season." But that stuff has changed quite substantially based off, you know, we get five episodes in and go, "Actually, this interesting thing is turning up; let's lean into that."

#### BEN

Here's a tidbit: we know how the series ends. We know how the whole thing ends, [__TIM:__ Oh, the whole shebang.] and we're not going to tell you.

#### TIM

No, 'cause that would ruin everything.

#### BEN

I mean, that would be a __[mutters]__.

#### TIM

That would be bad. But, like, it may well change. Like, we sat down in a café, Gail's in Brighton. Very nice. You should go.

#### BEN

Oh, very-- Oh, we might as well have been in the San Francisco of Brighton. We sat down with our coffees and our cinnamon buns and we talked about *art*.

#### TIM

Art. Art! Yeah, and just sort of, you know, mapped it all out. And I like what we've got but, hey, if we think of a better idea between now and then [__BEN:__ Yeah.] it will change.

#### BEN

Oh, actually, one thing as well. Just to say, we *do* entirely rerecord episodes.

#### TIM

Yes, so--

#### BEN

There have been episodes where we've-- Like, we've either done the whole planet improv and gone, "That just, in general, wasn't very good."

#### TIM

Yeah.

#### BEN

"Should we take another swing at that [__TIM:__ Sure.] using what we've learned?"

#### TIM

Yeah. __[laughs]__

#### BEN

Or, for example--and I think this is absolutely fine to say--when we had Simon in as Harry, [__TIM:__ Yeah.] we recorded an episode with Simon and then the editors, David specifically, kind of said, "This is not coming across as you think it might be coming across." [__TIM:__ Yeah.] Because we had one Scottish person and they were a complete idiot. [__TIM:__ Yeah.] And that didn't translate very well.

#### TIM

No, and the thing is--

#### BEN

Now, Simon is Scottish [__TIM:__ Yeah] so it was fine but also, from the external perspective of you guys, it might have looked like, okay--

#### TIM

What's this? __[laughs]__

#### BEN

--this is some kind of weird stock, stupid jock character, right?

#### TIM

Yeah, exactly.

#### BEN

So, we rerecorded it. And, we ended up with an a lot stronger episode.

#### TIM

And we did exactly the same thing with Hartro. Not for the same reasons but we just developed the character.

#### BEN

Yes.

#### TIM

You know, that is a thing with improv. Like, yes, we can talk about what the character is and what they're like, but we started doing it and realised, "Oh, you know what? These characters don't fit together-- the relationships don't fit together in the way that we might hope. Let's have another go at it." We did, and we ended up with much better episodes.

#### BEN

Yeah, 'cause it gave Jenny the opportunity effectively to practice as well.

#### TIM

Exactly.

#### BEN

Because, by the time she was recording, we'd already done, like, five of them, so Trexel and David were pretty well established. And it's just like, "Now, hey you, brand new, you know--"

#### TIM

Drop in.

#### BEN

"--drop in and be as developed a character." Which is just really difficult. A lot of--

#### TIM

Yeah, it's mean. We're mean people.

#### BEN

Yeah, it's not really fair. So, the fact that we got an opportunity to rerecord means that you now have the foot-based Hartro you know and love. __[Tim laughs]__ That's all Jenny's fault, by the way.

#### TIM

It was all *entirely* Jenny's fault. I get a lot of flak for that butthat-- all her. We just-- __[laughs]__

#### BEN

_(crosstalk)_ It's Jenny's fault but-- We just "yes and"-ed the feet.

#### TIM

Which is the drawback of "yes and". Eh, you just have to go with it. __[Ben laughs]__ 

So, this is a question from CMP: 

>"Do Tim & Ben see the planets beforehand?"

#### BEN

We do.

#### TIM

We do.

#### BEN

We do _(mean voice)_ and we judge them!

#### TIM

_(imitating Ben, sharply)_ "We judge them--" _(normal)_ So, I think there is definitely a line between seeing the planets beforehand and planning the planets beforehand. Because we get a big list of suggestions. You, Ben, Ben who I'm talking to--

#### BEN

Hello, it's me, Ben.

#### TIM

--probably go-- you go through it a little bit more than I do and just sort of, like, run off the top of your head, like, "Yeah, this one works. That one doesn't." You know, [__BEN:__ Yeah.] 'cause sometimes the questions, especially early on when the answer-- especially early on when people didn't really know the premise.

#### BEN

And we were ask-- and, to be honest, we can ask what the questions better.

#### TIM

Exactly.

#### BEN

Uh, the next round of questioning will be much, much better.

#### TIM

But would include things like pop culture from the 20th century. You know, I think--

#### BEN

Yeah. Yeah, 'cause there are certain unsaid rules that we have, [__TIM:__ Yes.] which we didn't tell people, [__TIM:__ Yeah.] so it is difficult. And there's also, like, planets which are really good ideas but are either--

#### TIM

Done.

#### BEN

--over-developed [__TIM:__ Yeah.] to the point where we can't really riff inside that idea. Like, it's a bit like, "Oh, well, you make this and this and this and then that's kind of it." What we need is, like, this balance between it's not so vague that it could be anything, [__TIM:__ Yeah.] but it's not so specific that it can only be one thing.

#### TIM

Yeah. And I think listening from episode to episode, you can see where we got that balance right and wrong. __[laughs]__

#### BEN

Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.

#### TIM

There's definitely ones that sort of flow better than others but it's very difficult to tell. But what we don't do is sit down with the chosen planet and go, "Right, what shall we do with this one?" Like, I genuinely forget what the suggestion is multiple times in an episode because we looked at it once when we picked what ones we were gonna do over a season and then we hit go and you pick one and start talking. So, we-- and that's intentional. I don't want for us to sit down with it and--

#### BEN

Yeah, no that's illegal.

#### TIM

--think about what we're doing. It's improv and illegal and the improv police will turn up.

#### BEN

It's an improv crime.

#### TIM

And they'll im-- improvound-- they'll impound-- something that's a combination of the word improv and the word impound.

#### BEN

This is becoming very much like that *BoJack Horseman* episode.

#### TIM

_(sings)_ ♪ Consummé professionals. ♫ __[laughs]__

#### BEN

__[groans]__ Okay. Moving swiftly on. 

So this is from Miss Clapp Trapp: 

>"You've said this podcast has an overarching plot, so how do you make sure to hit the plot beats while improvising?"

#### TIM

You keep the plot beats *away* from the improv. __[laughs]__

#### BEN

Fundamentally. I mean, where one thing is well is-- what we do do is we go through a-- when we're planning a season, or at least we did for season one, and we're probably going to do for season two, is we have twenty-five episodes so we kind of pick a thing that's going to happen on that episode. [__TIM:__ Yeah.] Like a one-sentence "David does this". Like it would be David starts rewriting the briefs. [__TIM:__ Yeah.] You know, that would have been a thing that we're going to introduce in around about, like, episode twenty-two or something.

#### TIM

That's our sort of A to B, by the time we get to the end we need to introduce the idea [__BEN:__ Yep.] of this in some way.

#### BEN

So, we have that guiding light which, you know, we'll script around that to, like, really hammer that home. But when we're improvising, we improvise with that in our minds so that we can start to riff around that kind of stuff. [__TIM:__ Yeah.] You know, and we'll do that for the other seasons, I think, of having, like, a one sentence-- Because pacing is really important and if we didn't do that then it would be like we might have ten episodes of nothing happening and then suddenly five episodes of *everything* happening and being like __[yells]__. You know.

#### TIM

Yeah, exactly. No, no, that's very succinct Ben. Well done.

#### BEN

Thank you.

#### TIM

You'll be paid this week.

#### BEN

Good.

#### TIM

Owen Shirell. Oh, getting another question in.

#### BEN

Well, to be honest, Owen's last question was really a non-question. __[laughs]__

#### TIM 

_(crosstalk)_ Well done, Owen. Didn't get the last one. A mulligan. A mulligan for Owen.

#### BEN

Yep.

#### TIM

>"What was the ratio of scripted to planned content to improvised content in Season 1, and will that ratio change in Season 2?" 

Like, 5% to 95% scripted to improvised.

#### BEN

Yeah.

#### TIM

I think it's very, very little as we've talked about. And I think we will pretty much try and keep that in season two. I think, since the show's inception, we've ended up with a lot more plot than we thought we might.

#### BEN

Yep.

#### TIM

And that's still only around about 5%.

#### BEN

Yep.

#### TIM

Any sort of gear change like that, regardless of what format, is always going to be a bit tricky to do and you're gonna lose people.

#### BEN

Well, it's the kind of thing as well. Like, it's with any piece of media, you need to be really confident that your format is robust.

#### TIM

Exactly.

#### BEN

And you need to build it to be flexible enough. Like, it's the kind of thing that, you know, I'm neither Jonny nor Alex, but it's fundamentally--

#### TIM

Woah, woah, woah, woah. You're neither--

#### BEN

I am. I am Ben.

#### TIM

Okay.

#### BEN

Ugh.

#### TIM

I thought you were-- I thought you were the holy podcast trilogy. __[chuckles]__

#### BEN

Yeah. Uh, no. But we all sound the same, so, you know.

#### TIM

That's true.

#### BEN

Like, with *Magnus*. The fundamental format of *Magnus*, because so much has happened and developed, if Jonny had been less careful about how the format works, it could have broken. But he thought really carefully about it and has managed to keep it consistent. But you need to put in that work at the start. You can't suddenly be like, "Oh, whoops! Gotta change it!" __[Tim laughs]__ Which, you know, podcasts can survive that and people can salvage it. But, fundamentally, if you have your format and you had from the start and are confident in it and make it flexible enough to develop, then you're in a much better place than if you didn't.

#### TIM

And fingers crossed, we're gonna do that for Stellar Firma.

#### BEN

Wait for it to *crash* and burn in season two!

#### TIM

For it to crash and burn. __[laughs]__ The Hindenburg of podcasts they'll call it.

#### BEN

Yep. Okay, so Hobbes asks: 

>"Was it planned from the beginning that David would hijack things and make good planets for a bit, that the final episode would be a trial and Hartro's... unusual style of management?"

#### TIM

So, let's take this question in stages. Was it planned from the beginning that David would hijack things and make good planets for a bit? Kind of, yes.

#### BEN

Yeah, not planned from the *beginning*?

#### TIM

But very early on. [__BEN:__ Yeah.] After an episode you're like, "Where would be interesting and fun for these characters to develop?" And I think it's: Trexel knows what's going on but is incompetent; David doesn't know what's going on and is more competent. So, if you think about the arrows of, sort of like, character development trajectory, those sort of point past each other [__BEN:__ Yep.] and need to switch. And that's, sort of, the best way of doing it. So, yeah, so, in that sense, yes?

#### BEN

Yeah, but like vaguely.

#### TIM

Vaguely yes.

#### BEN

There was the kernel of an idea [__TIM:__ Yeah.] but it wasn't as developed as it is.

#### TIM

The final episode being a trial, yes, I think even in the first plot outlines. Like, again, I think it might--

#### BEN

Yeah, when we went through, we decided how do we have a...

#### TIM

A consequence.

#### BEN

Yeah, how do we have consequences which don't ruin the format and just destroy the dynamic.

#### TIM

Exactly, 'cause it, you know, there was a lot of people who, I think could, especially before we were recommissioned, were like, "Oh, this will end with David getting recycled."

#### BEN

Or killing Trexel.

#### TIM

Or killing Trexel. And like, both would be great ends if we were planning to do just one season, [__BEN:__ Yeah.] but we think there's a lot more fun to be had here so __[chuckles]__ let's not blow up the, you know, jump the blow up Death Star shark. [*sic*]

#### BEN

__[snorts]__ And, the final thing, "Hartro's unusual style of management", no, the feet was Jenny's. Jenny, Jenny brought the feet in. We had to-- we ran with the feet. We ran on our feet. With the feet in our mouths.

#### TIM

_(crosstalk)_ Nope. Feet. Jenny Haufek. __[laughs]__ Yeah. In our mouths.

#### BEN

And that occurred.

#### TIM

Yep, so, letters to Jennifer Haufek, 123 Foot in your Mouth Street, Brighton. 

Question from Nomen: 

>"If Stellar Firma hadn't been renewed, would episode 25 [have] ended with David 7 getting recycled?"

#### BEN 

_(amused)_ We're very good at preempting these questions.

#### TIM

Yep, yep. __[Ben stammers]__ I don't know.

#### BEN

It would have ended some way.

#### TIM

Yeah, I think maybe everybody would have died. __[laughs]__ I don't know. If we were doing, like, one season, maybe somebody goes "What does this button do?" __[laughs]__ [__BEN:__ Boom!] And someone explodes. Yeah, I don't know. I honestly don't know.

#### BEN

But also we weren't really planning for it *not* to be renewed.

#### TIM

No. Even in the early stages. Call us mad optimists, but we were planning for multiple seasons, because if you plan for just one season and you wrap it all up completely nicely, there's kind of nothing left to do in season two. And I think there are shows that have, you know, suffered from being like, "Well, you know what? We might not get renewed" and then they do and they're like _(frightened)_ "Oh, quickly! Write something new!"

#### BEN

Yeah, and I think, like, the trial ending, we probably wouldn't have had the extra addendum scene with Number 1 and Number 48?

#### TIM

Yes.

#### BEN

But fundamentally, having that big trial and then having the status quo, sort of, reinserted is-- it's like the *Stargate* way of writing, which is "assume you're going to be cancelled, but leave it open for..."

#### TIM

Yes!

#### BEN

So you don't want an obvious cliffhanger, which obviously, now we're renewed, the scene between Number 1 and Number 48 *is* the obvious cliffhanger.

#### TIM

Yeah. Who *are* these people? Why?

#### BEN

But if it just ended with Trexel, you know, having to swap out which bar he goes to... __[stutters]__ Fundamentally it means that the relationship has been reestablished and it could go somewhere, but that mini-arc [__TIM:__ Yeah.] is concluded? And we probably could've left it at that?

#### TIM

Yeah.

#### BEN

You know.

#### TIM

Yeah, and you assume that, you know, they muddle along together.

#### BEN

Yeah.

#### TIM

But there will be unanswered questions around sort of, you know, like, the whole thing around David's programming and all that sort of jazz, which again, you know, we have *vague* ideas about and we've got options. Which is nice! I like writing it that way. I like to give us, sort of, options and then, as you hone in on a reality, it sort of becomes so.

#### BEN

Yeah. So this is from ERK: 

>"Did you always know who would play Trexel and who would play David 7, and if not, how did you decide?" 

No, we knew.

#### TIM

Yeah.

#### BEN

Fundamentally, because of Tim's improv experience, he *needed* to be the driving force.

#### TIM

Yeah. And also I'm very selfish. So...

#### BEN

Yeah, I mean, trying to make him play David would be impossible.

#### TIM

Impossible.

#### BEN

He wouldn't-- It would be... Drexel.

#### TIM

Drexel Seven. So yeah it, sort of, begged him from the start. 

From Bookofmac: 

>"How do you warm up to sustain Trexel and David's voice while not straining your own?"

#### BEN 

_(matter of factly)_ Of all the voices I do, David's is the easiest.

#### TIM

Yes, 'cause it's yours but higher. __[chuckles]__

#### BEN [as David]

Well, no, it's me but more nasal.

#### TIM

Nasal.

#### BEN

I just, I talk up into my nose?

#### TIM 

_(as David but with an accent)_ And I think I can-- my accent isn't quite right, but in tone, I think I can [__BEN:__ Yes.] pretty much match you.

#### BEN

Well, yeah we can both do David, [__TIM:__ Yes.] _(as Trexel)_ and we can both do Trexel.

#### TIM 

_(as Trexel)_ Well, I think my Trexel is better.

#### BEN 

_(as Trexel)_ Well, I think *my* Trexel is better.

#### TIM 

_(as Trexel)_ Well, I think my Trexel is better.

#### BEN 

_(as Trexel)_ No, I think *my* Trexel is better.

#### TIM

Very confusing for everyone.

#### BEN 

_(as Trexel)_ At this point, who's talking!? __[Tim laughs]__ We'll never know!

#### TIM

Yeah, so I think you've got a bit of a better time of it than me in terms of sustaining it because the Trexel growl-- you can keep it in a register that doesn't hurt your throat, however, if you're not careful-- I think there is a lot of bloopers where it's just me coughing.

#### BEN

Yeah.

#### TIM

But I don't walk away from a few episodes with a completely raw throat, so... There's sort of an addendum to this question. Warming up the voice and stuff like that-- It is very important guys. We always warm up the voice. [__BEN:__ Yeah, we do.] We do tongue twisters, and--

#### BEN

But we more do it for pronunciation.

#### TIM

For diction and stuff like that, because I'm a bit of a rubber mouthed fool.

#### BEN

As am I!

#### TIM

As are you! In fact, I actually just realised I said "mouth" with an F, which a do a lot, 'cause I'm dyslexic and I constantly get the F's and Th's the wrong way, so, you know--

#### BEN

I just have a very slight lisp.

#### TIM

Yeah. Oh, so you do.

#### BEN

There is-- Okay, so we got one from Bittercape for Tim: 

>"Do you regret Trexel's voice? Is it difficult to maintain?"

#### TIM

I don't regret it. It is difficult to maintain at times.

#### BEN

And then: 

>"What does it sound like when Tim tries to do the David voice and Ben tries to do the Trexel voice?"

#### TIM

We're just get ahead of ourselves--

#### BEN

We just really get a-- Oh that's from hotsoup, sorry.

#### TIM

Hey, hotsoup! Guess what? Your future crimes have already been handled!

#### BEN 

_(crosstalk)_ Wait, we'll do a little-- we'll do a little-- let's do a little scene!

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ Roleplay holovision initiated.

##### [electronic powering on sound]

#### TIM

Okay, um--

##### [for the following scene with Trexel and David, Tim is playing David and Ben is playing Trexel]

#### DAVID

Ooh...

##### [door swooshes open]

#### TREXEL

David! __[David yelps]__ David.

#### DAVID

Oh! Trexel!

#### TREXEL

I'm... *so* drunk

#### DAVID

Trexel! Trexel, it's-- it's twenty minutes left! We've got to get the brief done!

#### TREXEL

I've chopped off both of my legs.

#### DAVID 

_(whispers)_ Trexel.

#### TREXEL

I have forgotten who I am. Am I David 7? I don't know.

#### DAVID 

_(singsong)_ I'm in the vents now!

#### TREXEL

Am I-- I get in the vents.

#### DAVID 

_(crosstalk)_ No, I'm in the vents.

#### TREXEL 

_(crosstalk)_ No, I'm the vent boy!

#### DAVID 

_(crosstalk)_ I'm in the vents!

#### TREXEL 

_(crosstalk)_ Get out of the vents! __[David yells]__ Right. Right, I'm in the vents now. Oh! Ooh! So soft. So soft in the vents. I like the vents. I've padded them with feathers __[Tim laughs, and keeps laughing throughout the rest of the roleplay]__ taken from a cosmic chicken! They're a thing. I've established cosmic chickens now, 'cause my tactic is just to take an animal and put 'cosmic' or 'space' in front of it. Now I'm just insulting Tim.

#### TIM 

_(laughing)_ Your Trexel is a lot poshier than mine.

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ Roleplay holovision terminated.

##### [electronic powering off sound]

#### TIM

Yes, that is-- Hey, it's not all that, but it's not *not* all that.

#### BEN

Yeah. Who was speaking? Maybe it was just Tim and Ben, maybe we just-- maybe we rused you.

#### TIM

You've been rused! 

Cas: 

>"Is there a particular bit, song, or joke you are extra proud of, or really enjoyed recording? What was your fave part of the season?" 

Ben.

#### BEN

Oh goodness. Um...

#### TIM

There's a lot of bits so it's a little...

#### BEN

Fave part of the season... I mean, I have to say the Cardinal Fang episode.

#### TIM

Yes.

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ Cardinal Fang!

#### BEN

I don't know if it's my favourite, but it's definitely the most memorable and the fact that everyone picked up on __[Tim laughs]__ Tim just refusing to stop saying--

#### TIM and BEN

_(simult.)_ Cardinal Fang!

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ Cardinal Fang!

#### BEN

Yeah, is--

#### TIM

Which I did not remember was a Monty Python thing, 'cause it came from a suggestion.

#### BEN

Oh, right?

#### TIM

There was a character called-- You know the Spanish Inquisition?

#### BEN

Yeah?

#### TIM

The one that isn't-- the one that I think Terry Gilliam plays is called Cardinal Fang.

#### BEN 

_(surprised)_ Oh, really?

#### TIM

Yeah, and that's what the suggestion came from. We did not know that. We just took it-- __[Ben hums in understanding]__ We took the suggestion on good faith! __[laughs]__

#### BEN

Yeah, that's it. You've tricked us.

#### TIM

You've tricked us.

#### BEN

Joke we're extra proud of... oh well, I'm actually-- I guess... I like the fact that I have established that David is very slimy.

#### TIM 

_(pleased)_ Yes!

#### BEN

I think that's just a really fun thing and it has developed the idea of David being able to __[holding back laughter]__ slip and slide around the place.

#### TIM

Well, there's a very good bit where you just get onto the floor and slither away. __[laughs]__

#### BEN 

_(laughing)_ Yeah, exactly! So I'm pleased of that. And song or joke-- Oh, this is it. It's me singing David's Fact Corner [__TIM:__ Yes.] even though it was, you know, it's a Patreon bonus-- that was a sneak preview, guys, the song's on Patreon. _(starts slurring)_ Come and join-- join us for the full episode some point-- __[continues slurring]__

#### TIM

It's a whole thing.

#### BEN

It's a whole thing. But mainly because it made Rach, my wife, completely lose it.

#### TIM and BEN

_(in unison, singing out of key in David's voice)_ ♪ David's fact corner! ♫ __[both laugh]__

#### TIM

My favourite-- Well, you know, there's probably a joke that if I was reminded of I might like more, but I really enjoyed recording the bit where I kept on saying _(as Trexel)_ "That's my point."

#### BEN 

_(gleefully)_ Ooh! Yes!

#### TIM 

_(as Trexel)_ Oh look! A point. Oh, I laid an egg. A point egg. _(normal voice)_ And I just really enjoyed-- __[starts laughing]__

#### BEN

Oh my god. That was so hard to record against.

#### TIM

I just enjoy interrupting you with different ways of saying I've made a point.

#### BEN

I lost it so many bloomin' times.

#### TIM 

_(as Trexel)_ Oh, careful of that point-- Who's got that point?

#### BEN 

__[chuckles]__ Yeah... 

Oh, this is for me! It's from Definite Human Jess: 

>"Were the scenes by guests in the finale (the testimonies & conversation between #1 and #48) improv or scripted?"

#### TIM 

_(posh)_ A mixture! __[Ben 'Hrmms' in a posh way]__ So, we did a load in the studio...

#### BEN

I have to say, I was very surprised when Sue Sims turned up.

#### TIM

I didn't know!

#### BEN

Didn't expect *that* at all!

#### TIM

That was a little easter egg for everyone from Alex!

#### BEN

We recorded testimonies in the room.

#### TIM

Yeah!

#### BEN

I guess our silly voices were not convincing enough, so Alex decided that he __[Tim laughs]__ had to give *other people* things to say.

#### TIM

And I think John Henry did one as well?

#### BEN

John Henry did do one!

#### TIM

Who I have a very, very vague connection to outside of--

#### BEN

Well, you can tell, when that was recorded, because obviously he was in the studio recording the *Magnus* episode with... Oh, one of the head of the Desolation cult? So obviously, Alex was like, "Oh, but! While you're here-- While you're here, could you just give us some things about Trexel?" __[laughs]__

#### TIM

And my one interaction with John Henry outside this was a bit awkward, and I'm still embarrassed about it.

#### BEN

Oh good! Good.

#### TIM

So, I met him in Edinburgh, I was much younger. He was in The Beta Males who I idolised, and then we knew Guy Kelly a *little* bit, and we knew Richard Soames a *tiny* little bit, and they were having a drink and went, "Oh, come along!" And then John Henry was just trying to have a nice conversation with his friends and then we were like, "Hey! We're here! We're from university student people town and we're *very* annoying!" So... __[both laugh]__ So, I don't think he was best pleased.

#### BEN

Oh, it's every conversation [__TIM:__ Well, I imagine--] when a university-- excited university student turns up.

#### TIM

There's no good-- There's no pot of gold at the end of that rainbow, [__BEN:__ No.] you know? I've-- After shows that have gone well, I'm not saying that I am a celebrity, but after shows when people come up and they're like, "I really enjoyed that thing!" It's lovely, and then the people that really know what they're doing are like, "I really enjoyed that thing. Thank you!" *and then they turn and walk away*, because what are we gonna do? Where does the conversation go from here? I'm English! I'm bad at taking compliments at the best of times! And there's no pot of gold. So, yes, I was on the wrong end of one of those interactions. __[Ben laughs]__ 

Calodette: 

>"How much gets cut out of each episode?" 

__[Ben exhales]__ It varies?

#### BEN

I mean, *that*is an answer only God and David know.

#### TIM

Exactly. I think... like, not as much as you-- I think-- Let's say a twenty-minute episode? Sometimes we might record twenty-five minutes--

#### BEN 

_(very quickly)_ Yeah, it takes anything between twenty-five minutes and an *hour.* __[laughs]__

#### TIM

We have occasionally submitted forty to fifty minutes of audio __[laughs]__ to be cut down. That's-- normally only gets that bad if we've, say, like, redone a big chunk or something like that.

#### BEN

Yeah, to be fair, that's usually about two episodes.

#### TIM

Exactly. Exactly. So, like, a lot less than you'd think, because a lot of what gets cut out is we've flubbed a line, we take a ten-second section again... There's not a lot of going back and completely redoing scenes.

#### BEN

So, from Owen Shirrel, which--

#### TIM

Oh! Back again, Owen! Felt jilted at the first, and now you're back for a third sup of the cup. __[Ben snorts]__ *(slower)* Sup of the cup.

#### BEN

Horrible. 

>"Which, if any, of the planets created in Season 1 would you want to live on?"

#### TIM

Good question.

#### BEN

I think I would want to live on Harry's planet, because I can read books, [__TIM:__ Yep.] watch TV, keep up with the news--

#### TIM

What was Harry's planet, by the way?

#### BEN 

__[laughs]__ Oh the-- basically, the living room.

#### TIM

Oh, that was just a-- __[wheezes]__

#### BEN

The planet-sized living room. I can hang out with friends!

#### TIM

When we were really half-assing it towards the end. __[laughs]__

#### BEN

Socialise with friends, you know? Just pleasant! Just pleasant!

#### TIM

And then put it on your CV.

#### BEN

Either that or the Cardinal Fang planet which David developed.

#### TIM

Yes.

#### BEN

Which is kind of a bit of a lie because really Jenny developed that one because-- Oh, that's one thing to say as well. The planet's that David rewrote [__TIM:__ Yes.] were not written by us. [__TIM:__ No.] Fundamentally, we told Jenny just tell us something that is proper. [__TIM:__ Yeah.] So, I didn't have anything to do with the planets that David created. That was all Jenny just improving at us then us being like, "Yes, of course, that's what happened".

#### TIM

Yeah, yeah. Absolutely.

#### BEN

But it's just a lovely garden [__TIM:__ It was a nice one.] with a nice building and a good armchair.

#### TIM

I think, basically, all of the quote, unquote David designed planets are pretty nice but I think, yeah, the garden-- basically it's the Garden of Eden style thing.

#### BEN

Yeah. Oh! Or, the one with the robot, er, golden robot gondoliers.

#### TIM

Gondoliers. _(sings)_ ♪ Da da da, do do do. Golden robot gondoliers! Do ba dee, he is you! ♫

#### BEN

_(crosstalk, sings)_ ♪ Gondoliers! Da ba da, ho ha hah. ♫

#### TIM

Yeah. Those ones. 

So this next one is from Miss Clapp Trapp: 

>"How much of the world is the result of riffing off each other (Trexel's thing about fish, clone slurry, David's onesie, etc)?"

#### BEN

Most of it.

#### TIM

Pretty much all of it. Like, obviously we have the suggestion [__BEN:__ Yeah.] and that forms a basis but--

#### BEN

High level bullet points of, like, Stellar Firma: big company, makes planets, is rubbish, [__TIM:__ Yeah.] Board is scary... kind of it?

#### TIM

Yeah. Well, I think the fact that we can get to the end of an episode and think, "Actually, maybe we need to have another go at that" is kind of indicative of the fact that we don't have [__BEN:__ No.] much going in. You know, we try and--

#### BEN

Well, we completely changed the tenor of-- in the last episode when we had the corridor scene, we recorded a version of the corridor scene where there were people around and then decided [__TIM:__ Yes.] actually no.

#### TIM

Especially as we're on the lower decks.

#### BEN

Yeah, so we riffed that because we said, "Oh, we wanted Trexel to try and talk to people and them ignore him" but then we said, "Ah, actually, let's redo this and just riffed a different version." So, like, the version of Stellar Firma you could have seen--

#### TIM

I just realised I misunderstood the question. It's about the world-building as in the [__BEN:__ Yes.] show world building--

#### BEN

Not the planets.

#### TIM

--not the planets.

#### BEN

'Cause that's-- I would hope people would have got the fact that the planets is riffing.

#### TIM

You'd have hoped so. But, yes. Yeah, so, yeah. What Ben said in terms of we got a few __[laughs]__ key-- I really had a real gear shift when-- record scratch in my brain as I realised I got the question wrong.

#### BEN

*(crosstalk)* __[laughs]__ Aaaaargh! What he said, yeah.

#### TIM

But, yeah. Yeah, we got bullet points about the world, but yeah. The fish thing, the clone slurry thing, the onesie thing, all just we said a thing and was like, "Oh, well, we've said that now. And we like it [__BEN:__ Yeah.] and we'll keep it."

#### BEN

So this is from AGVZ, agvz, hello agvz: 

>"How sentient is IMOGEN? Is her 'personality' programmed, or does she have something like free will? At first, I thought she was a standard corporate AI, but then she says things like 'Watch it, buster!' [__IMOGEN: [beep]__ Watch it, buster!] and happily joins in the chant of 'Cardinal Fang!' [__IMOGEN: [beep]__ Cardinal Fang!] I'm curious about her!" 

Well, you'll have to continue to be curious, won't you! __[gruff]__ Won't you! Won't you! Won't you!

#### TIM 

_(crosstalk)_ Well, well, well, well. Because answering this question is very heavily what the plot will be.

#### BEN

We're gonna get the plot spritzer and spritz you in the plot face.

#### TIM

Yep.

#### BEN

Stop! No!

#### IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ Watch it, buster!

#### TIM

E. Forney: 

>"Are we going to see more of Harry?" 

Um, I believe so.

#### BEN

If Simon ever wants to talk to us again.

#### TIM

I mean, sure, he already had to do two episodes with us and he looked *very* bored by the end. __[laughs]__ No, that's untrue. Yeah, no, I-- So Simon, who plays Harry, is sort of my main improv husband in that I am in another group as well where it's sort of a bit bigger and there's more people, but I do sort of probably the most shows with Simon. We do improvised musicals at Edinburgh under the name *Do the Thing*. Do come along.

#### BEN

Always be hustling.

#### TIM

Always be hustling! Sold out last year and the year before, so suck on that.

#### BEN

Oh, Brighton Fringe, by the way. Not Edinburgh Fringe.

#### TIM

Brighton Fringe.

#### BEN

It doesn't go to the proper Fringe.

#### TIM

Well, the thing is--

#### BEN

It doesn't go to the soul-sucking Fringe.

#### TIM

--the Edinburgh Fringe is a long way away, you lose money, and it's, for the performers, sometimes *horrible*. Whereas, the Brighton Fringe is eight seconds from my door.

#### BEN 

__[chuckles]__ And it's fine.

#### TIM

You still-- It's pretty good! Yeah, it's very nice. In many ways, I prefer it. But then, I'm sure if I lived in, you know, [__BEN:__ No. Yeah.] Sheffield and it was really difficult to get down to Brighton and I had to pay for accommodation, I'd probably feel a little bit different.

#### BEN

Molly: 

>"Does David-7 have a mullet? I feel like he has a mullet." 

Well, [__TIM:__ Well.] if you feel like he has a mullet, he has a mullet. [__TIM:__ What do--] If you feel like he doesn't, then he doesn't.

#### TIM

What do you feel the poem is saying in your opinion?

#### BEN

Well, no, but basically-- I mean, fundamentally, *all* of the different versions David 7, Trexel, Hartro, even IMOGEN are great. And I personally have absolutely no confec-- uh, con-- mm.

#### TIM

Confection?

#### BEN

Confection.

#### TIM

Confection.

#### BEN

_(silly nasal voice)_ I like sweeties!

#### TIM

Ah, lovely.

#### BEN

I personally have absolutely no conception of what David 7 looks like. [__TIM:__ Hmm.] Apart from the things I've said like he has a onesie.

#### TIM

Yeah.

#### BEN

Um--

#### TIM

And that's intentional.

#### BEN

Yeah.

#### TIM

You know, there's-- it's much more fun to have the fan community do the art and be like, "I like this, I like that" [__BEN:__ Yeah.] rather than be like, "No! This is how they look! Do art of this person!"

#### BEN

Yeah, like, I really like the ones that Raven does where he looks like _(laugh in his voice)_ a little sad Ernie. __[laughs]__ It's really fun!

#### TIM

A little sad Ernie. I like--

#### BEN

But also, all the other ones where he's got [__TIM:__ Yeah.] little hooves and, like, yeah. It's just, it doesn't matter. It's all good.

#### TIM

And he's very unclear as to whether the hooves are actual things that David has or if it's just-- 'Cause the thing is, I often say that people have hooves [__BEN:__ Yeah.] in real life. They don't, but I still say it.

#### BEN

That's the danger of saying things in an improv context.

#### TIM

Yeah.

#### BEN

Did you mean it literally?

#### TIM

Who knows?

#### BEN

Who knows? Hoof knows?

#### TIM 

_(sings)_ ♪ Hoof knows! ♫

#### BEN

How about yourself? Like--

#### TIM

Yeah, again I don't really... like, for example, I really enjoyed one where I ended up being sort of like a grey-skinned, horned, sort of troll thing.

#### BEN

Yeah.

#### TIM

You know, I just thought, "Oh, yeah, I hadn't really... thought of this."

#### BEN

Or the one that, like, jackalopearts does where you basically look like Hunter S. Thompson.

#### TIM

_(excited)_ Yeah! Yeah!

#### BEN

You're like-- __[weird mouth noises]__

#### TIM

Hair all over the place, loud jacket, big square glasses. Yeah. A lot of fun. 

Moss, again, asks: 

>"Is the security department just plain told to ignore the security alerts from Trexel?" 

_(balking)_ Well. Well. Well. Plot.

#### BEN

_(crosstalk, also balking)_ Wh-ell. Wh-ell. Mm.

#### TIM

So, I think I'm happy enough to establish at this point that there is a certain amount of, "Oh, they've come from Trexel's office. Well, let's not spend too much time and resources..."

#### BEN

Also, show you how the sausage is made: that was a fun idea which got developed into [__TIM:__ Yeah!] more than it was intended to be. So...

#### TIM

Yeah! And the wonderful thing about improv plot is I might make it a big important thing.

#### BEN

Yep.

#### TIM

Or I might not.

#### BEN

We'll see where it goes.

#### TIM

Who knows.

#### BEN

You know, we don't know.

#### TIM

We don't know. The important thing is we don't know. [__BEN:__ Yeah.] Much like the team behind *Lost* and that worked out fine. __[laughs]__

#### BEN

_(sarcastic)_ Oh, good. Yay. _(normal, chuckling)_ Hey, look, we actually know how our series ends.

#### TIM

That's very true.

#### BEN

Fatal drum asks: 

>"Why does security never come when alerted?"

#### TIM 

_(jokingly irritated)_ Look, we already told you-- Fatal drum--

#### BEN

I feel like these questions __[Tim laughs]__ have been ordered in a way to catch us out.

#### TIM

That is why, Fatal drum. 

acdmcmstr07 [pronounced academic master oh seven]: 

>"If Trexel is only working with the seventh iteration of the David clones, has Trexel only been working in planet design for 3 months now? Or what did he do before having Davids around to help (and then get killed)?" 

So, big assumption that clones just called David. [*sic*] I might have been with Terrances 1 through 109, Garys 6 through 84, you know.

#### BEN

So, fundamentally, this is a problem that we realised and went, "Hang on a minute. This doesn't match up." [__TIM:__ Yeah.] So, then we came up with the excuse that maybe there's been Eileen 1 through 3,052.

#### TIM

So, I very-- I sort of retconned this and it's now [__BEN:__ Yep.] being built into certain things that the name is basically like the brand. [__BEN:__ Yeah.] You know, the chemical/biological mix.

#### BEN

The David line. Eileen line.

#### TIM

Yeah. Exactly.

#### BEN

Terrance line.

#### TIM

It's like they're all part of the same genus but they're slightly different variations on species.

#### BEN

Yeah. Fundamentally, we realised that this was a problem I think about fifteen episodes in.

#### TIM

Yeah.

#### BEN

And we sort of sat down and went, "Ooh, hang on a minute." [__TIM:__ Yeah, I mean, you guys haven't guessed.] So, this is the reason we've come up with. Again, improv is great [__TIM:__ Improv!] 'cause you can just cover your ass whenever you want and shout *improv*!

#### TIM

And again, the great thing is that is probably a better work around ending than I probably would have come up on my own. [__BEN:__ Yeah. Yeah.] Which is, again, the fun thing about it. You end up with-- It's easier to do and the ideas are better. Why write anything down in advance, idiots. That's a--

#### BEN

__[snorts]__ Never plan!

#### TIM

--that's a call-out to all scriptwriters.

#### BEN

Yeah. Looking at you Jonny!

#### TIM 

_(muttered)_ Yeah, you Jon-- Yeah, it's clearly not worked for him.

#### BEN

Yeah!

#### TIM

Idiot.

#### BEN

*Magnus* is rubbish!

#### TIM

Terrible.

#### BEN

It's gonna fail. Raven: 

>"So when is Trexel releasing his new album? __[Ben chuckles]__ Particularly looking forward to Laser Friend."

#### TIM

__[clapping hands between words, obviously grinning]__ I want to produce a proper album __[Ben sighs deeply]__ of songs.

#### BEN

Don't encourage him.

#### TIM

__[clapping hands between words]__ It is my goal but no one is supporting me. __[laughs]__ Yeah, I--

#### BEN

Well, apparently Raven is supporting you.

#### TIM

I really, really, really, really, *really* want to do __[Ben groans and laughs slightly]__ more fleshed out, instruments-- However, I think everyone who's not me, and maybe a few of the fans, are looking at that and the work to get out of it ratio is--

#### BEN

Albums are hard to record.

#### TIM

__[laughs]__ I mean, we've got a composer who did the theme tune.

#### BEN

Yeah.

#### TIM

And, you know what? David's a man of many talents. I'm sure he can-- __[laughs]__

##### [error buzz]

#### BEN

Do you know why the songs are so short that we get from him?

#### TIM

Uhh...

#### BEN

It's 'cause it's hard and expensive.

#### TIM

__[laughs]__ It's hard and expensive. Now, see, so I-- obviously, as I mentioned, I do improvised musicals, and a lot of the work we do there is trying to improvise something that actually sounds relatively polished by the time it comes out of your face, but we do that with a very experienced live musician who is not particularly interested in this stage in coming into a hot studio and working for hours and hours and hours to make an improvised song work in a recorded fashion. So, I'm working on it guys but *no one* likes me. __[laughs]__

#### BEN

Just keep shouting at Anil [__TIM:__ Yeah!] and maybe it'll pop up as something.

#### TIM

Come on! Ah, dear. Like, we do a lot of rehearsals where we get to the end of it and I heavily lobby for us to sit down and properly, like, flesh out a song, but no one's interested apart from me __[Ben snorts]__ and there's Raven. 

Bittercape: 

>"For Tim." 

This is a question for Tim. Hi Tim. 

>"What is Trexel's relationship __[Ben laughs]__ with the fish? And: is it the same fish each episode? What does it smell like?" 

__[Ben snorts]__ In answer to the first question: I'll tell you when you're older. __[Ben laughs]__ The second part: it is the same fish. Weirdly for Trexel's personality, he is *very* traditional and monogamous, __[Ben chuckles]__ he doesn't care for poly... fish relationships. _(breaking into laughter)_ He's a real fundamentalist apparently! __[both laugh]__ Going to the end of this sentence. He's--

#### BEN

By the way, we are recording this on Brighton Pride Day, as well, so... __[laughs]__

#### TIM

Ah, yeah. We're very inclusive. _(laughing, sarcastically)_ Why do you think we've sequestered ourselves away in a hot studio. Because we hate pride! This isn't going in.

#### BEN

__[laughs]__ No, it's 'cause there's too many people! There's too many people and I hate it!

#### TIM

No, I've been-- I've marched in the pride parade with a charity. I felt like a bit of a fraud because I am--

#### BEN

Not any of those things.

#### TIM

--basically as cis and het as it gets, unfortunately. And fortunately. It's fine. But we marched as part of a suicide prevention charity. And I really like the pride parade if I'm *in* the parade and, therefore, it's regulated how many people are around me. __[Ben laughs]__ In the crowd, I am always an inch and a half away from screaming and hitting someone 'cause it's so busy [__BEN:__ Yep.] and so... trappy.

#### BEN

Too many people, many social anxiety, and also, fundamentally, it's not for me.

#### TIM

It's not for me!

#### BEN

It's not for me!

#### TIM

We have every other day.

#### BEN

I'm a straight guy, I can... It's fine.

#### TIM

So, yeah. So, in short, it smells bad.

##### [beat]

#### BEN

Not pride. The fish.

#### TIM

__[laughs]__ The p-- Sorry, the fish! __[both laugh]__ Well, you know what? In Brighton on a hot day, it does smell bad. __[laughs]__

#### BEN

_(crosstalk)_ Actually, no, yeah, no, pride is going to smell pretty bad.

#### TIM

'Cause there's beer and piss everywhere.

#### BEN

And sweat!

#### TIM

And sweat.

#### BEN

It's just people are going to be very sweaty.

#### TIM

And do you know what? Sweat contains a lot of uric acid, Ben. So...

#### BEN

Okay, sweat doesn't smell like piss though.

#### TIM

Yes, it does.

#### BEN

No, it doesn't!

#### TIM

It smells like piss. It's got uric acid in it.

#### BEN

_(yells)_ My armpits do not smell like urine! __[bleep]__

#### TIM

_(referencing the editor)_ David, get rid of it, all of it. __[both laugh]__

##### [beep]

#### BEN

smalltownai asks, to dig us out of this *horrible* hole we've dug ourselves into... __[Tim chuckles]__ The things we do for all of you. 

>"Do the ID numbers have any significance? Does it mean anything that Trexel's ID number is two numbers shorter than Hartro's and David's?"

#### TIM

Are they?

#### BEN

These'll be in the show notes.

#### TIM

Yeah, let's quickly navigate to the show notes __[Ben scoffs]__ live. 'Cause I feel like I've done something about this clever.

#### BEN

Okay, fundamentally, it sounds like Tim made a mistake and now we're gonna come up [__TIM:__ Hey!] with a reason why this is fine.

#### TIM

Let's have a quick look.

#### BEN

_(shouting)_ Improv! Improv!

#### TIM 

_(distracted because he's looking up show notes)_ Improv.

#### BEN

Improv! Dives out of a window.

#### TIM

So, yes, there is absolutely a reason for this that I thought about when I wrote these things down. So, let's quickly navigate to--

#### BEN

A Hartro episode.

#### TIM

--a Hartro episode. So-- __[deep breath]__ So we've got [__BEN:__ There we go.] Hartro is sort of, like, what is it, 63277482, Trexel is 362884, and David-- So basically, my conception of it is the IDs are sort of, to a certain extent, first come, first serve. And also linked to the, sort of, hierarchical-- What would the word be? Like, lineage-based system--

#### BEN

So, what you're fundamentally saying is that the Geistman family were the 360-- 362,884th family to be part of-- or, like, bloodline or gene.

#### TIM

Around that. [__BEN:__ Yeah.] Or, like, there's a certain amount of handing down of numbers, you know, like a sports jersey.

#### BEN

Right, and then if you mix lineage, you're given a new number.

#### TIM

So, it's not completely, you know 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. There is a certain amount of hierarchical-- You know, the shorter your number, the more old and respected your family is. [__BEN:__ Mm-hmm.] So, Hartro has a higher number but it's much lower than David's 'cause David is at the end of things where it's, like, it's just the next one in the line. [__BEN:__ Yep.] You know, there is-- that's just-- So, you know, at the moment of his birth, his number might well actually be the highest there is [__BEN:__ Mm.] because he is the lowest of the low.

#### BEN

Oh, interesting. So that means there has, as of, you know, a couple of weeks ago in the show's timeline, 9,584,000...

#### TIM

No, 95 million.

#### BEN

Oh, 95,847,335 people... no, *lineages* [__TIM:__ Lineages.] which work for Stellar Firma Ltd.

#### TIM

Exactly. So sometimes--

#### BEN

That's a lot.

#### TIM

--there's individual people that just have the number once. Other times it's a reused number because it's, like, a respected range [__BEN:__ Yeah, yeah.] of numbers. So that's-- you know what, that's probably more complicated than it needed to be, but I do think about these things probably more than I need to in this...

#### BEN

Little suggestion for next time.

#### TIM

Hm?

#### BEN

Clones should have "dash" their number.

#### TIM

Oh, like a little, [__BEN:__ Yeah.] like a little codicil.

#### BEN

Like a little versioning... thing.

#### TIM

Yeah. Okay. Okay.

#### BEN

There you go.

#### TIM

Digipup: 

>"Does David actually have hooves?" 

Who can say?

#### BEN

Who knows? If he has hooves for you, [__TIM:__ Yeah.] he's just a hoofy, hoofy boy. [__TIM:__ Yeah.] If there's some nice, nice toesies, if you believe in toes, [__TIM:__ Yeah.] toes away. __[Tim chuckles]__ How many? Fifteen toes? Three toes?

#### TIM

Maybe you're a two-toed ungulate.

#### BEN

Yes. __[makes clopping noises]__

#### TIM

Could be. __[makes clopping noises]__

#### BEN

That's basically hooves. That's just flesh hooves.

#### TIM

Hey, hey!

#### BEN

Make a decision!

#### TIM

Ben, after what we said earlier, let's not get very demonstrative and specific about what we believe does and does not constitute a hoof.

#### BEN

Cass&Jared: 

>"Is all the food is made out of slurry, what are the drinks at the Cosmic Lounge made out of? Or, how are clones made?"

#### TIM

Uh, slurry, slurry, and slurry. So, I think there is a certain amount of-- There's a big tank of genetic material that is changed into different things-- which, to be honest, is probably not too far away from how things will go in the future. You'll have a medium and then you'll do certain things to it and flavour it and--

#### BEN

It's a classic sci-fi trope. I think that's how the Star Trek stuff works?

#### TIM

Yeah. You know, it's-- well, to a certain extent, that's how everything works in that everything is made of atoms and then you do, [__BEN:__ Alright, mate.] you know, different arrangements of it and then it's just different things.

#### BEN

_(crosstalk, making fun of Tim)_ Oh, yeah, sure. Everything's just atoms. Oh, yeah, get him over here.

#### TIM

__[laughs]__ Get him over here with his science saying [__BEN:__ Yeah.] things are made of atoms like some sort of PhD poindexter. __[Ben laughs]__ Uh, yeah. So, basically, the care and attention and quality of the slurry is sort of different, so the slurry that the clones get is just sort of, you know, edible but vinegary hot mess.

#### BEN

Tastes like hot socks, I think it.

#### TIM

Tastes like hot socks! And then the ones the consultants get is better, and line managers is better. And, you know, the drinks at the Cosmic Lounge, probably the more expensive they are, the better they are. But, yeah. It's all made out of a medium [__BEN:__ Yeah.] which is slurry. As are the clones!

#### BEN

As are the clones.

#### TIM

So, at certain points, you're probably drinking reconstituted clone.

#### BEN

Oh, als-- Absolutely!

#### TIM

A little-- yeah.

#### BEN

Basically, imagine the grimmest possible--

#### TIM

Timeline.

#### BEN

--outcome.

#### TIM

Yep.

#### BEN

And, yes, that.

#### TIM

Yeah, that one. 

Mars: 

>"Whose idea was the foot thing?? __[Ben snorts]__ Why are the review episodes so kinky???" 

Jennifer Haufek.

#### BEN

Kinky Haufek!

#### TIM

Kinky Haufek! __[laughs]__

#### BEN

Old kinky Haufek!

#### TIM

Old Haufek the kinkmeister. Yeah. So, yes. Sure, did we run with it? Okay. Is she responsible ultimately? Yes, she is. __[Ben laughs]__ Letters to her. And a follow-up question from Mars: 

>"Has Trexel been the only designer to have clones from the David line? Or is there another design consultant out there making planets with David-2 or something?"

#### BEN

Um, hmm.

#### TIM

So, I think, given the speed that he's got through them, potentially he does get through big chunks of a line before anyone else needs a new one, but that's not canon. [__BEN:__ Yep.] That's, you know... Maybe--

#### BEN

As yet to be decided, basically.

#### TIM

A.Y.T.B.C. Did I get that right?

#### BEN

_(proud of Tim but confused)_ You did.

#### TIM

Yeah!

#### BEN

I just got confused.

#### TIM

Yeah, A.Y.T.B.C.

#### BEN

A.Y.T.B.C. The old, well-known acronym.

#### TIM

_(pronouncing it as a word instead of an acronym)_ Aytbc.

#### BEN

__[snorts]__ Miss Clapp Trapp asks: 

>"Based on the finale... is Stellar Firma Ltd. actually financially sound?"

#### TIM

Well. Well. Well. __[laughs]__

#### BEN

_(crosstalk, silly voice)_ Well, guess you're gonna __[starts slurring words, makes mouth warm-up sounds]__ I don't know!

#### TIM

And final question, E. Forney: 

>"CARDINAL FANG?"

#### BEN and IMOGEN 

__[beep]__ Cardinal Fang!

#### TIM

CARDINAL FANG!

#### BEN

CARDINAL FANG!

#### TIM

_(yelling at the top of his lungs)_ CARDINAL FANG!

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Cardinal Fang!

#### BEN

_(crosstalk, whispering)_ Cardinal Fang. Cardinal Fang. Cardinal Fang. Cardinal Fang. Cardinal Fang. Cardinal Fang. Cardinal Fang. Cardinal Fang. Cardinal Fang. Cardinal Fang. Cardinal Fang.

#### TIM

_(crosstalk)_ So, I hope you've enjoyed this episode of the season-- It's not an episode. __[laughs]__ Card-- _(cautiously)_ Ben. Ben, we have to finish now. It's very hot, and we've been going for quite a while.

#### BEN

Continue without me. I'm fine over here.

#### TIM

Okay.

#### BEN

_(whispering)_ Cardinal Fang. Cardinal Fang. Cardinal Fang. Cardinal Fang. Cardinal Fang. Cardinal Fang. The Side Winder. The Big Barber. Cardinal Fang. The Lake Wither. The Ham Throw.

#### TIM

_(crosstalk)_ So I hope you've enjoyed this season one Q&A of Stellar Firma with Tim and Ben. Lot of fun. So hopefully we'll be doing more of these in the future. Hopefully one at the end of season two but who knows? There might be some Patreon exclusive Q&As as well. So, it's a big thank you from Tim Meredith.

#### BEN

_(sarcastically)_ And a small thank you from Ben Meredith. Really, I don't appreciate this much.

#### TIM

He doesn't like you all. Lovely. Thank you.

#### BEN and TIM

Bye!
