__[shorter version of the show theme]__

#### BRYN

Hello and welcome to today's episode of Stellar Firma. This is a little different to the, uh, normal Stellar Firma episodes. We are not meeting with, uh, Trexel and David-7 today. Instead, I am here with Tim Meredith--

#### TIM

Hello!

#### BRYN

--and Ben Meredith--

#### BEN

Hello.

#### BRYN

--who, of course, are the two stars of our show-- to talk about the *science* of Stellar Firma: whether there is any, what they know, and most definitely what they don't know.

#### BEN

No, nothing, everything.

#### TIM

Show's over. __[Bryn giggles]__

#### BEN

So it's done.

#### BRYN

Oh, cool that was quick, uh, alright, uh, we'll-- we'll cut the recording there. No one needs to know any more. Uh, okay, I am Bryn Monroe. I am a member of the Rusty Quill Gaming podcast which is why I'm here today because, basically, I know these reprobates from way back. I think I've been brought on to host this very special episode due to the fact that many, *many* years ago now, I studied theoretical physics, uh, at university.

#### TIM [crosstalk]

You're a science boy, aren't you? You're a science boy.

#### BRYN

I am very much a science boy with a specialism absolutely in cosmology, and my-- my master's di-- dissertation was on the thermodynamic properties of black holes. So, uh, as you can imagine, there've been several points during the, uh, first season of Stellar Firma when I've *winced* heavily while listening. Uh, and we're gonna see how many of those I can remember today, and, uh, talk about w--what-- what exactly-- wh-- what thought has gone into these episodes.

#### TIM

Sure.

#### BEN

Okay.

#### TIM

Would you like me to do my bona fides?

#### BEN

Yeah, me too.

#### BRYN

Oh, yeah. [__TIM:__ Let's-- Let's-- Yeah.] Let's-- Let's get some-- Let's get some *credentials* from the two Meredith brothers.

#### TIM

Uh, Ben, do you want to start with your credentials?

#### BEN

Okay then.

#### TIM

Okay.

#### BEN

So, uh...No, so I am Ben Meredith. BA MA-- I think MA just replaces the BA? I've got-- I actually don't know how it works, but my BA is in English Literature and my MA is in Creative and Critical Writing, so lots of science in there.

#### BRYN

Oh yeah.

#### TIM

Hmm. Hmm. The science of language. Uh--

#### BEN

Uh, that's linguistics and it's not what I did.

#### TIM [crosstalk]

Oh... It's different. __[Tim laughs]__ Not even that!

#### BEN

Nope.

#### TIM

Um, my name is Tim Meredith and I did a-- a BA in Politics. You *could* do a bachelor's of science, but I chose not to. __[Ben snorts]__

#### BRYN

Nice, nice. If I had to state my formal qualifications then, uh, BA Hons, MA (Cantab), MSc, probably something else too that I'm forgetting [__TIM:__ Yeah.] but it-- I don't think that's *terribly* important. The important bit is my-- my high-level knowledge of cosmology and very specifically black holes, but black holes really aren't the focus of Stellar Firma. The focus of Stellar Firma, I'm-- I'm pretty sure Trexel stressed this heavily in the very first episode, is that Stellar Firma designs planets. Not moons!

#### TIM

Not moons!

#### BRYN

Not-- Not solar systems. *Planets.* [__TIM:__ Planets.]

#### TIM

Unless we design a moon. In which case, sometimes moons.

#### BRYN

Sometimes moons. But-- But mostly as an add-on to a planet

#### BEN [crosstalk]

He doesn't like it. He doesn't like it.

#### BRYN

You wouldn't design a moon all by itself.

#### TIM

It's like building a conservatory. You know, people do it, but it doesn't make you, uh, an architect. It just makes you [__BRYN:__ Sure.] a, y' know, a glass merchant.

__[Ben huffs out a laugh]__

#### BRYN [sceptical]

Sure. Okay, so-- so I think my first question for the two of you is-- is: What do you think a planet is?

__[...]__

#### TIM

That sounds like a trick question and I'm frightened.

#### BEN

Yeah, I was gonna say __[Tim laughs]__

#### BRYN

_[crosstalk]_ Oh yeah, definitely.

#### BEN

I'm pretty sure I know the answer to that, but do I?

#### BRYN

Every-- Every question I ask is gonna be a trick question on some level, guys.

#### TIM

Should we-- Should we go, uh, Should we both-- both give our thoughts, or do we wanna take them in turn, like, I'll do one and Ben will do one?

#### BRYN

I think the normal chaos produced from [__TIM:__ Okay.] the meeting of your two minds will do just fine.

#### TIM

Well, I'll shout then. So my thoughts, um, are I think a planet is... a big collection of matter around a single point, and it's gone hard, and then sometimes-- __[Ben bursts out laughing and Tim giggles]__ No, no, okay so-- so my understanding is you've got like-- you've a big load of dust, like-- you're-- just-- *dust* that's... from somewhere. And some of the dust is *more* in one place than the rest of the dust and so __[voice pitches up]__ it's got a little tiny bit of gravity, and then more dust goes, "Well, that's where the party's happening." And so that gets there, __[Bryn chuckles]__ and that naturally increases the gravity-- And then they're like "Whoa, guys, have you seen that dust? Come over here." And then that just, sort of, gets really out of hand until all the dust is in one place--

#### BRYN [talking over him trying to get him to stop]

Sure. Sure, sure sure. I mean, you're talking about the planet creation process here.

#### TIM

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

#### BRYN

When I say "What do you think a planet is?" [__TIM:__ Yeah.] What I mostly mean is "How do scientists classify what's a star, what's a planet, what's a moon, what's a comet..."

#### BEN

_[crosstalk]_ I'll have a go on this one.

#### TIM

_[crosstalk]_ Yeah, you go. You go.

#### BRYN

"What's a dwarf planet..."

#### BEN

Sure. So I think a planet is a...uhm...a celestial object above a certain size which orbits, um-- or, has a sustained orbit around a star.

#### TIM [impressed]

Ooh, that sounded confident.

#### BRYN

Yeah. Yeah, that's the basic definition. To be classified as a planet, there are a few other criteria though, which you-- you-- you've sort of touched on there. So one of the really important ones is the, uh, the orbit. So it's got to be orbiting a star. If it's orbiting another planet-- or, well, a star system technically because you can have binary and trinary stars-- but importantly, you're right that the planet has to be a certain size. It also has to be a certain regularity of orbit. If it's not a-- If it's not a-- If the orbit is not, basically roughly circular, __[TIM:__ Hm.__]__ then it does not meet the quorum to be classified as a planet.

#### TIM

So is there, therefore, no such thing as a rogue planet, 'cause as soon as it, sort of, starts to get out of hand it loses its planetary privileges, and it's like, 'you're just a lump now.'?

#### BRYN

Essentially...Yes. __[Tim wheezes]__ At that point, it becomes a comet or an asteroid, or-- yeah, I-- I mean, a rogue-- rogue planet is very much a-- we've got an interesting thing here, because there's obviously the classifications known to *science* [__TIM:__ Yeah.] and the classifications known to science *fiction*, [__TIM:__ Sure.] and there is some overlap. They don't necessarily always, uh, mesh perfectly. So a-- a rogue planet is much more of a science fiction content. Y'know, a-- a-- I don't know what a scientist would call it. Probably something silly like a roaming astronomical body. They wouldn't-- yeah-- __[TIM:__ 'Cause they're fun.__]__ But yeah, i-- it's tech-- *technically* not a planet.

#### TIM

Sure.

#### BRYN

So h-- how many of the planets we've-- we've allegedly designed in season one of Stellar Firma do you think meet the technical, uh, scientific definition of a planet?

#### BEN

Probably none.

#### TIM [laughs]

Probably none. __[Bryn laughs]__ 'Cause I don't think we often talk about wh-- I think there's maybe a couple of mentions of, uh, of one of our quote-unquote "planets" orbiting something, but that doesn't often come up? Like, we're-- They're normally just, sort of, hanging in-- in just, sort of, space.

#### BRYN

I-- This is something I've always wondered. I mean, wh-- what-- in your minds, what is the-- what is the, uh, sort of, the backstory behind Stellar Firma? When a client is coming to Stellar Firma with-- with a-- with a request for a planet, do they already have a star? Are you also providing the star?

#### BEN

Well, I assume the build team just works with that.

#### BRYN

Do you just know a bunch of stars...

#### TIM

It's like--

#### BRYN

Are you-- So you're making the stars as well as the planet?

#### TIM

I don't think-- It's like-- it's like if you were building a house. You wouldn't also have to build the school that it's nearby in order to give amenities, or, like, build the water grid. You know. Like, we're just-- We're using the stars as they are, and then just, like pitch up a-- boom, there's a planet

__BRYN; [crosstalk]__ Yeah. Well, I mean, but there's the-- The star is more like the ground that the house sits on in this metaphor basically.

#### TIM

The space gr-- Y-- You're right, Bryn! It's the space ground. Thank you.

#### BRYN

It *is* the space ground, yeah. So you've-- you've got to have-- you've got to have your star before you can have your planets, [__TIM:__ Yeah.] so you need to own-- I'm presuming you need to own a star system where you want the planet to go?

#### BEN

Or, you know, you rent your spot.

#### TIM

...Yeah!

#### BEN

Like a parking space.

#### BRYN

Yeah. [__TIM:__ Yeah.] That-- Yeah.

#### TIM

Or maybe you could have that whole thing where people who own, uh, like, static trailers own the trailer, but not the ground, and then one day they sell the trailer park and it's like, "Cool! Get your house out of here." That sort of thing.

#### BEN

Yeah, just suddenly the sun implodes and...

#### TIM

Yeah! Yeah, get your planet out of here.

#### BRYN

Oh, yeah. Suns imploding is a big problem, I imagine, for Stellar-- for Ole Stellar Firma Ltd.

#### TIM

It *really* affects the property values.

#### BEN

_[crosstalk]_ It's Trexel.

#### TIM

It *really* hits 'em hard. It does.

#### BRYN

Yeah. Yeah.

#### TIM

It does. It's a shame.

#### BRYN

One of the things that's-- that has come up in a few different, uh... very much in the earlier recordings, is we discussed potential sizes and shapes for planets as well, and it-- it seemed to me that as we got further through the season, you guys stopped worrying so much about the size and the shape of-- of-- of the planets you were designing.

#### TIM

We stopped worrying about a lot of things __[Tim and Bryn laugh]__ as things went on. Uh, yeah I think-- Ben, what'd we-- what did we-- We definitely had a scale really early on and I think it might have been along the lines of "Small one, little bit bigger, pretty big, quite big, and really big". Is that-- is that roughly-- roughly how we classified them?

#### BEN

Well, whatever the scale was, it was vague and unremembered.__ [Tim laughs]__

#### TIM

A vague and unremembered scale.

#### BRYN

And obviously, you-- I mean, you mentioned, Ben, that a planet technically has to be of a certain size to meet the-- to meet the definition of a planet. But I think we can assume that all Stellar Firma's basic planet shapes meet that-- meet that definition.

#### BEN

I definitely say that the planets that Trexel makes trend towards the big.__ [TIM:__ Yes.__]__ 'Cause there's just always a lot of stuff on them.

#### TIM

Yeah. Yeah. Well, I mean, go big or go home is always-- is tattooed on my legs.

#### BEN

And it's what he says when he orders a triple at the Cosmic Lounge.

#### TIM

Yes. __[laughs]__ And then I drop the glass. Um, although I do think the first one we ever did was explicitly-- after all that moon chat and all that planet chat-- I think the first thing we did was a trough moon __[BEN:__ That's true.__]__ and I may have yelled the-- I've yelled 'trough moon' quite a bit, so ...I'm nothing if not inconsistent.

#### BRYN

I think-- I think there is an issue here though, which is basically that the human brain really is bad at comprehending the size of a planet because, I mean, Earth is pretty average as the size of a planet goes, and, uh-- I mean, I've listened to every single episode. I love the show. Big fan. But--

#### TIM

It would-- It would be awkward if you said you'd listened to three and I'm-- it's not for me. __[Bryn laughs]__

#### BRYN

It would be. I mean, I got to suggest one of the planets. [__TIM:__ You did! We'll get there.] We'll meet that one later. Obviously, I've got lots of extra thoughts __[Tim wheezes]__ about the one that came from *my* Patreon suggestion. Erm, planets are *big,* y'all. I mean-- it's just, there's *so much space* and I don't think that any of the designs that I remember covered the scale. I mean, think about-- think about our planet. Have you described enough stuff to fill up all of North America? [__BEN:__ Well--] All of Africa? All of Russia? [__BEN:__ I-- I think, Bryn--] In-- in an episode?

#### BEN

What you have to, uh, consider is: Have you ever thought about how big any of the things we're suggesting are? Because, um--

#### BRYN

Oh, that's a good point.

#### BEN

They're real big. You know, we say a mall? That's a continent. We say a wrestling ring? It's probably the size of Belgium. So-- __[Bryn laughs]__

#### TIM

Yeah. Yeah, you can't see the other side of the ring because of the curvature of the Earth. That's-- that's how *big* we're talking here.

#### BRYN

I see. That-- that wasn't clear to me. I'll-- I'll retract that particular criticism. __[Tim chuckles]__

#### BEN

You know, we don't even know how big the people, uh, who are asking us for their [__TIM:__ That's true] planets are.

#### TIM

That's true. This is a question. Is there-- this is gonna sound pretty stupid, even as I think about it __[Ben chuckles]__ but I've-- but I've started so I'll finish-- Is there... to do with a planet's size *then* a natural height to which things can go before they poke out of the atmosphere and it gets ridiculous? Is-- Is there some sort of relational... I'm gonna say relationship-- a relational relationship between the size of the planet and how tall things are allowed to be on them? Because otherwise things are gonna start getting into the th-- like the tallest animals that ever existed if you were on too small a planet, would it be like you can't have animals that big because they're so *tall* that their heads would poke out of the top of the atmosphere and they'll be all sort of suffocated__ [Ben laughs]__

#### BRYN

W-- well, that's a really interesting question. Um, so-- [__TIM:__ It is, isn't it? __[laughs]__ I'm more intelligent than I think.] Yeah! Yeah, I like that question. Um, so the-- I mean, the amount of atmosphere on a planet is related to its size and its density. Put its size and its density together to give you its mass, which affects how strong the gravity is. [__TIM:__ Hmm.] But it's not the only factor. So like, you've got for example, if you look at the three planets: Venus, Earth and Mars. They're all... *roughly* the same size. Mars is a little bit smaller than the other two. But they've got *very* different atmospheres [__TIM:__ Yeah] So Earth is the atmosphere we're used to. Mars has *almost* no atmosphere. Now, it does have one but it's so much thinner. It's like if you're standing on the surface of Mars, it's like being twice as high as Everest or something. You know, the consistency of the air is so thin that you-- you basically can't notice that it has any. But it's not quite as bad as the inside vacuum of space. So, you know, if you build a-- a colony on Mars, you don't have to worry about explosive decompression to quite the same extent.

#### TIM

Right.

#### BRYN

Venus has a really thick atmosphere. So it's in fact larger than Earth, because it's got so-- there's so much gas around Venus and it-- so it, you know, the atmosphere stretches further from the surface of the planet. So, you know, if we-- if-- if we were professional planet designers, as two of you play on TV __[Tim snickers]__ we would have to consider--

#### TIM

On audio TV. __[Tim laughs]__

#### BRYN [corrects himself]

Audio TV. Erm, you're not a planet designer, you just play one on TV. [__TIM:__ Yeah.] We'd have to consider this kind of thing! We'd have to consider what sort of atmosphere we were putting on these planets. Um, i-- it's-- it's not a discussion I don't think I've ever heard the two of you have! [__TIM:__ No.]

#### BEN

Well, we would do if we didn't only have 20 minutes to design

a planet.

#### TIM

That's true. [__BRYN:__ That's fair.] That's true. Although we can't use that as a consistent excuse for any of our-- 'Well, we only have twenty minutes' Well, yes! __[Tim laughs]__ That's *my* fault.

#### BRYN

I mean, if-- if Trexel would just turn up on time for once!

#### BEN

Exactly! I keep asking him. You know this isn't just about Trexel, I actually asked Tim to turn up. __[Tim and Bryn laugh]__ We have an eight hour recording session. This isn't a... thing, it's a--

#### BRYN

I would--I would pay so much money for an eight hour episode of Stellar Firma.

#### TIM [pained]

Oh.

#### BEN

We would *die.*

#### BRYN

That would make me so happy.__TIM:__ The wheels would come off so quickly. __[Tim laughs]__

#### BRYN

Knowing how the two of you would suffer recording it.

#### BEN

Then I'd actually have to eat like, some kind of awful porridge. __[Bryn laughs]__

#### TIM

Yeah. Yeah, a quiet porridge that doesn't turn up on the audio.

#### BEN

No, I mean like *clone slurry,* 'cause then we'd have to be eating in character, we'd have to go to the toilet __[TIM:__ I see...] at which point remember that David can't get out of the rooms so we'd have to get some sort of camping, __[TIM:__ That's true.] uh, like, toilet--

#### BRYN

Uh, yeah, I'm pretty sure in one episode, you suggested that the chairs in the room also are able to act as toilets.

#### BEN

Yeah, but the chairs in our studio aren't. __[Bryn laughs]__

#### TIM [feigning disappointment]

No. No we'd have to craft special chairs-- special toilet chairs. [__BEN:__ Yeah.]

#### BRYN [crosstalk]

Oh, that's a good point. That's a good point, yeah.

#### TIM

We'll commission! Do you think we could expense that? Ask Alex. Ask Alex if we could expense toilet chairs.

#### BRYN

He's nodding. I mean, he's crying, but he's nodding.

#### TIM

There you go!

#### BRYN

I mean, the other super important consideration for any planet along with the size, which you have paid lip service to, is how dense you want the planet. You know, uh, because that affects gravity, which affects literally everything that happens, uh, on the planet. Including the consistency of its atmosphere, the inhabitants' abilities-- ability to move and [__TIM:__ Hmm.] not collapse under their own weight, just by being placed on the surface. __[Tim 'Hmm's again]__ Which I'm not-- again, I'm not sure it's something you-- you've paid a lot of attention to in the episodes.

#### TIM

Well, a lot-- a lot of our planets are-- are-- if not hollow, there's certainly not a lot going on in them. 'Cause I think-- I think we've-- we've-- well, one was a big safe, [__BEN:__ Yep.] in which there were civilizations within civilizations within civilizations all-- all living in the mechanisms. And therefore whilst-- whilst the, you know, let's-- let's-- let's say, the safe is made of metal. Th-- There's also going to be so much air, that even if it's quite a dense metal, the fact that there's so many gaps means this all averages out to, let's say, limestone. So there's-- you have to sort of take that into account.

#### BRYN

So-- so--so, are-- are we using the planet's natural gravitational field or does Stellar Firma *build* gravitational technology into every planet? Do we have some sort of 'super sci-fi tech' that can control the gravity *independent* of the actual mass of the planet?

#### TIM

I think-- I think that's an added extra. That's got-- 'cause there's-- there's the, um, there's the one, uh, the old person's planet. And I don't know if we ended up putting it in but we definitely talked about gravity regulation and turning it sort of up and down and--

#### BRYN

You *did*! I remember that one, yeah.

#### TIM

Shifting it. Although, you know what? I think in the end, the way we got around that wasn't by generating gravity. It was by teleporting the planet around, to nearer and farther away from different stars and different, um, situations [__BRYN: [sighs]__ Oh, no..] to-- __[Tim laughs and tries to defend his solution]__ to-- [__BRYN:__ Yeah..] which would mean-- which would mean that whilst the gravity did change, it would change the gravity towards the--

#### BRYN

No, it-- it wouldn't. That wouldn't--

#### TIM

But it would change the--

#### BRYN

That wouldn't change the gravity.

#### TIM

Not on the planet.

#### BRYN [crosstalk]

That's not-- That's not how gravity works.

#### TIM

But it would change-- it would change--

#### BRYN [crosstalk]

No, exactly. __[Tim laughs]__

#### TIM

It would change the gravity towards the star so it's like in here, the gravity's changed, so you all fall off the planet in one direction towards the star, which is-- __[Tim breaks off, laughing]__

#### BRYN

No, no, that's also not how that works.

#### TIM

Is that not how that works?

#### BRYN

No.__ [Bryn laughs]__ No, I'm afraid that is very much not--

#### TIM [crosstalk]

Well, how does it work, Mr. Science?

#### BRYN [still laughing]

--not how that works.

#### TIM [indignant]

Go on! So okay-- okay, yeah, __[Bryn laughs]__ I've got a question for you, *Bryn*! Bryn, [__BRYN:__ Please, please.] Captain-- Captain *Maths*! So-- so, okay, let's-- let's take orbit out of it, because I appreciate that the-- the-- the, um, the orbit is a lot of it. But let's just say you've got a planet in it's stationary--I know that that means it's not a planet, Bryn, __[Bryn laughs]__ but bear with me--so, let's say you've got a stationary, rogue astronomical body, and you've got it-- you've got it next to, let's say, a-- a regular-sized sun. By regular-sized sun, I mean our sun, because I'm sun-ist. [__BRYN:__ Sure, sure.] So-- so-- so, you've got it there and that's over-- that's over regular gravity. So you take that rogue astronomical body, and you don't change anything about it other than it's now next to a much, much larger sun with therefore much higher gravity. So, whilst I appreciate that part of it will be the-- the planet will fall into it,* before* that, is it possible that it could, like, pull people off of it, out into space? Like, if you have a sudden, like, gravity-creating object--

#### BRYN

No.

#### TIM

'No.' Why? Answer me that!

#### BRYN

Er, so the gravitational force on any object is governed by two things: the-- the-- the mass that is causing the gravitational force, [__TIM:__ And love.] and its-- and its distance from that mass. And so if you're on the surface of a planet, the gravitational pull on you from the center of the planet is always going to be *much* stronger than any nearby star, because although the star is potentially millions or billions of times larger [__TIM:__ Yeah.] in terms of mass, it is-- for life to even exist upon this-- this theoretical planet-- it's also got to be far enough away that the gravitational pull of the star is less than that of the planet.

#### TIM

Otherwise it just wouldn't be in the first place.

#### BRYN

Exactly. [__TIM:__ Hm.] Ah, and yeah, the planet can't be stationary. Like it-- it--

#### TIM

I-- I told you to allow me that, Bryn, what did I say? __[Tim laughs]__ Don't you--

#### BRYN

_[crosstalk]_ Yes, yes, absolutely.

#### TIM

I appreciate that.

#### BRYN

What do you guys think that the star *does* affect about a planet? So, in-- in the very first episode, we definitely didn't create a planet. Uh, we created-- I think it ended up being referred to as a trough moon?

#### TIM

Yup.

#### BEN

It is a trough moon, which is, in the Stellar Firma Company Handbook, classed as a planet. [__TIM:__ Yes.] So. Check. [__BRYN:__ Sure, sure.] And. Mate [__TIM: [laughs]__ Mate.]

#### BRYN

Yes. I mean, obviously science hasn't had to classify non-spherical or non-approximately-spherical objects. So... [__Bryn stammers__] You know, at least in theory it wouldn't meet the definition of a planet, but I think we're so far outside the realm of current scientific understanding that we can just sort of shrug and accept it.

#### BEN

Yeah, we're just way ahead of you, really.

#### BRYN [crosstalk]

Okay, yeah.

#### TIM

W-- wasn't there a cigar comet?

#### BRYN

Ah, yes. So, comets can be much more irregularly-shaped than planets. [__TIM:__ Sure. 'Cause they're funnelled] Um, yeah, and asteroids, uh-- uh, even more so. A comet tends to be relatively regularly-shaped because of the, uh-- the solar forces upon it. Whereas an asteroid, who knows? Um, but so-- the-- the trough moon, we did discuss things like, uh, day length and year length! Which I think was possibly the only episode that happened in. But it made me very happy that you at least considered these factors. So-- so-- so how--how do we think the-- the day length and the year length relates to the properties of the planet and the star of which it's orbiting around?

#### BEN

Erm, well, the year length is how long it takes to complete a full orbit and the day length will be based on how fast the planet's spinning.

#### BRYN

Uh, yeah! I mean, that-- that's-- that-- absolutely! Uh--

#### TIM

Um, uh, I'm sorry, I'm noticing a bit of a trend here of, uh, Ben calmly a-- and succinctly answering questions correctly, which I'm *not*-- [__Ben laughs__] I'm not a fan of! Given that thus far it's two:nil and [__Bryn laughs__] I feel like I've been made a fool of. [__Tim stammers__] I don't mean to be petty about this but I will--

#### BRYN

__[cutting off Tim's pettiness]__ Okay! So-- so, [__Tim chuckles__] a question to Tim then. Well, a follow-up question to Tim. What properties of the star and the planet *control* how long the planet takes to complete one-- one, single orbit? Any ideas?

#### TIM [in a quiet tone]

I feel like Ben's question was easier, but okay.

#### BEN

_[crosstalk]_ I was gonna say, to be fair __[Bryn and Tim laugh] __ I have no idea. I have no idea. Answer away, Tim.

#### TIM

Okay__,__ ah, repeat the question to me. I'm gonna really try to get this right.

#### BRYN

So what-- what properties of the-- the star and the planet, uh, govern how long it takes the planet to complete one orbital cycle?

#### BEN

Oh, sorry. I do know this one

#### BRYN [crosstalk]

The length of the year.

#### TIM

Oh, yes, I do know this one. So it will be-- it will be the mass of the planet itself and [__BRYN:__ Yep.] the gravity of the object it's orbiting around, because, uh, the greater the gravity, the faster the planet will have to be travelling [__BRYN:__ Yes.] in order to-- to keep the orbit and not crash into the object and that would, um, affect the speed and so on and so forth.

#### BRYN

Yes, __[Bryn stammers]__ sothat's half right. [__TIM:__ Oh!] You got the important bit right. [__TIM:__ Bugger!] The mass of the planet *actually* doesn't matter.

#### TIM

Does it not?

#### BRYN

No, if you-- there's-- there's several equations that apply to this situation and when you put them all together to solve, the-- the relationship, the mass of the planet drops out of the equations. [__TIM: [understanding]__ Oh.] It ends up not affecting in the same way that all objects fall at the same rate.

#### TIM

Sure.

#### BRYN

It-- For the same reason, all planets orbit at the same speed. But it is very much affected by the mass of the, uh, star. So the mass of the star has a huge impact on how fast the planet goes around. But there's the-- there's a second factor that plays into it as well.

#### BEN

Which is the length of the orbit, right? Like the-- the how far away the planet is [__BRYN:__ Yes! Yes. Absolutely] from the star.

#### TIM

Sure.

#### BRYN

So those are the two factors that--

#### TIM

In the way that the centre of the wheel is going much faster-- is travelling much faster. Sorry, is [__BRYN:__ Exactly] travelling much slower. Slower or faster? Gosh, the center--

#### BRYN

The center-- the center travels slower.

#### TIM

Slower. 'Cause you've got less to go to complete the revolution.

#### BRYN

Yes.

#### BEN

Consider... the graph friend.

#### TIM

__[softly]__ Consider the graph friend.

#### BRYN

__[softly]__ The graph friend.

#### BEN

Yeah, when you draw a much smaller circle--

#### TIM

It goes really fast.

#### BEN

There you go!

#### TIM

It whooshes-- it whooshes around, and sometimes your pencil breaks and you chuck your pencil out. Yeah, I understand. I'm glad-- Thank you! Thank you, Ben, for bringing it down to *my* level. __[Ben and Bryn laugh]__

#### BRYN

So, the mass of the star and the distance of the planet from the star-- hugely important in determining the orbital cycle. The other thing that they have a huge impact on is the amount of energy that the star transfers to the planet. Uh, that energy being primarily in the forms of light and, more importantly, heat. [__TIM:__ Hm.] So, it's quite difficult, potentially, to balance those two competing needs. If you want to control the length of the year-- the-- the length of the, uh, single orbit, you've also got to think about what effect you're gonna have on the climate of the planet, because the further that you move it, as we can see in our own solar system, the colder a planet is gonna get.

#### BEN

Well, that's-- as proven out, um, in the review for that planet, something we did not consider. Because we made soup.

#### TIM

We did. [__BRYN:__ Absolutely.]

#### BRYN

Boiling soup, as I recall.

#### TIM

As soup is wont to be. Is this what's referred to as the 'Goldilocks Zone'?

#### BRYN

Absolutely! Yeah. Do-- D'you know what the Goldilocks, uh, Zone is talking about? Wh-- what is the exact right temperature in the Goldilocks Zone?

#### TIM

Uh, I'm gonna say-- Well! Now, the thing is, the temperature--

#### BEN

Is that-- is that the surface temperature of the planet or how is that--

#### TIM

Yeah, 'cause that like, changes throughout the year. It's quite hot in England right now but that doesn't mean in winter, life ceases to be!

#### BRYN

Absolutely. And it's very different from different points on the planet. Er, our planet spins. Uh, it spins on an axis which is about twenty... three degrees off from directly perpendicular to its, uh, orbital motion, uh, which creates seasons, but also creates cold spots and hot spots. And the temperature on the surface of our planet can vary by almost a hundred degrees from the coldest spot to the hottest spot, I believe.

#### TIM

Really? I didn't know it was that much.

#### BRYN

Well, so, and-- and I believe that-- that the depths of Antarctica can sometimes reach minus sixty and the-- the hot-- the hottest spots in like, the Sahara Desert can reach fifty or fifty-something? So it's slightly over a hundred degrees __[Tim hums]__ of variance between those two.

#### TIM

And I found out literally today that thirty-seven degrees, but specifically thirty-seven degrees on the wet bulb scale which is, um, both heat and humidity, is the point at which uh, your-- humans are no longer able to regulate their body temperatures. So if it's-- if it's on a special scale that I don't entirely understand, but humidity and heat above thirty-seven and your body can't cool you down fast enough 'cause there's too much hot water in the air and you die.

#### BRYN

Yes. Yeah, it's-- it's pretty nasty.

#### TIM

Pretty nasty.

#### BRYN

Uh-- Uh, so, um, for example, Antarctica is not always in the Goldilocks Zone, whereas obviously the Earth as a whole, is. So the Goldilocks Zone is not, you know, a clear delineation of 'the whole planet must be exactly one temperature', [__TIM:__ Yeah.] but it's saying that you know, a significant portion of the planet is at the right temperature for a hundred percent of the year *or* significant portions are at the right temperature for a hundred percent of the year in total. Uh, and the Goldilocks Zone is referring to liquid water, basically, because that's-- as far as we're aware-- the most important, uh, factor involved in, uh, a planet being habitable.

#### TIM

Oh, so not so cold it's frozen and not so hot it's gas?

#### BRYN

Exactly.

#### TIM

Well, there you go.

#### BRYN

So Venus, for example, is too hot, even though technically it's in the Goldilocks Zone. Uh, its atmosphere is so thick and heavy that all the water that exists there is gaseous. And Mars... is also in the Goldilocks Zone in terms of distance from the Sun but its atmosphere is so *weak* that all the water there has frozen. So, the Goldilocks Zone is-- is a-- a sort of a theoretical distance but the practical distance is also affected by the planet's atmosphere.

#### BEN

So-- wh-- how-- if it's just liquid water, doesn't that mean you could have a planet in the Goldilocks Zone that just has an average surface temperature of seventy degrees?

#### BRYN

Yes.

#### TIM

Yes, 'cause like bacteria-- like extremophile bacteria lives in like, hot vents at the bottom of the ocean and which is-- yeah? Kind of that? So it's not mammals, sure, but something. Life.

#### BEN

Oh, okay, okay, so Goldilocks is general to life, yeah, yeah.

#### BRYN

Yeah, it's-- it's not-- it's not a perfect description, 'cause obviously, yes. A-- a planet which was a hundred percent, you know, a semi-boiling sea, would not be a great place for a human being to go on vacation.

#### TIM

Yes, but there would be deep-sea slugs that would be like 'h--hot dang, this is for me.' [__BEN:__ Very hot dang.]

#### BRYN

Absolutely. I believe we also-- the trough moon, if I remember correctly, as well as, uh... one of the other planets. I can't remember which one it was. The trough moon, I believe, had a day that was equal to its year? And one of the other planets you mentioned, uh, always had the same face pointing towards the star. So it had a light side and a dark side.

#### TIM

Yes, the-- the animal-murder-life-gun planet.

#### BRYN

__[in awe]__ 'The animal-murder-life-gun planet'. That was a very good one.

#### TIM

_[crosstalk]_ That's its official title, yes.

#### BEN

Planet number... three? Can't remember, it was two or three. It was one of the early ones.

#### TIM

Yeah, yeah, it was-- it was in our Blue Period.

#### BEN

Yeah.__ [laughs]__

#### BRYN

Now, that is actually a pretty common condition for an orbiting body to find itself in. It's known as being tidally locked, and the Moon is actually tidally locked to the Earth.

#### BEN

H-- hence the Pink Floyd album.

#### TIM

Yes. 'Wish You Were Here'. __[Ben and Bryn burst out laughing]__ Desperately trying to remember a Pink Floyd album. __[they all continue to laugh]__ 'Ah, got it!'

#### BRYN

It's not-- it's not quite a perfect thing 'cause obviously for the Moon, it's tidally locked to the Earth, so it's got the same face always facing the Earth. That's not a dark side and a light side, because the light is provided by the Sun. So all points on the Moon's surface eventually get some sunlight but only one side of the Moon ever gets any Earth-light.

#### TIM

Sure. So... so is there-- okay, bear with me-- are there-- are there [__BRYN:__ Sure.] planets tidally locked and therefore it doesn't have a day? Like there isn't a day, because a day is how long it takes to rotate, and it's not, so there is no day.

#### BRYN

We believe so. There's none in our solar-system. It seems to be a quite common, uh, state--

#### TIM

Pics or it didn't happen, Bryn! Pics or it didn't happen.

#### BRYN

Well, indeed. We have discovered, uh, as a species, uhh, something in the four hundred to five hundred exoplanets outside our solar system, but we don't know enough about them to fully establish whether tidally locked planets actually exist, but orbital simulations indicate that being tidally locked is quite a common state for an orbital body. So it seems likely that there *are* planets out there [__TIM:__ Hm.] where they have essentially a light side and a dark side, rather than a day-- a day-night cycle. *But,* it comes with its own host of problems because, uh, as I said earlier, a sun is in charge of providing, uh, light and, much more importantly,* heat* to a planet. So what do you think happens when you've got a, uh, planet that is tidally locked to its sun wh-- and the key difference between the-- the-- the, uh, light side and the dark side?

#### BEN [deadpan]

One side's hot.

#### TIM

Yeah. One side's hot. Um, again, it feels like a trick question. It's like-- 'Well, one side's always hot and the other's always cold which is bad for some reason.'

#### BRYN

It is-- it is very bad. Uh, the-- because, um, we talked about the-- the variation on the Earth's surface between temperatures. On a tidally locked planet, that temperature variation is gonna be *huge.* You're gonna be finding it very, very difficult to, uh, have a planet which is habitable because you're likely to get, uh, an incredibly hot side and an incredibly cold side. And here we're going into some more planetary science rather than cosmology, which is not my area of expertise but I do know a little.

#### TIM

Well, luckily it's ours, so you're-- you're covered.

#### BRYN

Brilliant. Brilliant. Uh, what happens if on a planet you've got in an incredibly hot place and an incredibly cold place?

#### TIM

Does the temperature differential, uh, like snap it in half eventually? Like if there's a cold side and a hot side, that means it'll be expanding and contracting in different, like, rates? Like, uh, the cold side is constantly getting more and more dense and the hot side is getting more and more, uhm... not dense? What's-- what's not dense, loose? That sounds wrong, um, __[Bryn laughs]__ uh, I genuinely don't know what the word--

#### BRYN

*Sparse.*

#### TIM

Sparse. __[Tim huffs a laugh]__ That side's getting sparse. So, like, you basically have like, a lumpy, weird planet that'll eventually snap, like when you pour boiling water into a glass. It smashes.

#### BRYN

I-- I hadn't considered that, actually. I think you'd have to have a very small, very solid planet for that to be a risk. But it does sound exciting.

#### TIM

So you're saying it's possible. __[laughs]__

#### BRYN

I'm not-- I'm honestly not sure. Um--

#### TIM

I'm beyond science.

#### BRYN

Any other guesses as to what atmospheric phenomena that, uh, tidally locked planet might be witness to?

#### BEN

Oh, um, wouldn't the atmosphere burn off?

#### BRYN

A small risk, yeah. If the planet gets too hot, you're gonna lose a lot more atmosphere to the vat cold-- hard vacuum of space.

#### TIM

Will it all be on one side?

#### BEN [crosstalk]

half an atmosphere... __[Tim laughs softly]__

#### BRYN

Actually, well, uh, uh, I mean, in a sense, yes. 'Cause the biggest problem, if you have a hold-- a cold section and a hot section in a single room, what happens in the room?

#### TIM

It becomes warm. Like-- like in the middle. There's a cold bit and a hot bit and the middle of the room--

#### BEN

Are you talking about convection?

#### BRYN

I am talking about convection.

#### TIM [crosstalk, desperate to get something right]

Is it wind? Does it get too windy?

#### BRYN

It's now three:nil to Ben, just for everyone keeping score at home. __[Ben chuckles]__

#### TIM

*Gosh*! *Damn it*! Hang on, hang on, didn't I get half a point? I believe I got half a point! __[laughs]__

#### BRYN

Oh-- No, you did get half a point. It's three and a half to nought-point-five.

#### TIM

I'll take it! __[Ben laughs]__

#### BRYN

Uh, yeah, so convection currents. The planet gets extraordinarily windy, if there's any sort of atmosphere to speak of. Uh, and you will-- you will lose the atmosphere a little faster than you might want to.

#### TIM

You know what? It sounds petty but I *was* thinking that, and then I thought 'No, Tim, that sounds stupid, 'It's too *windy*'? You don't want to lose any more points!' __[Ben chuckles]__ And I choked. I choked!

#### BRYN

It really would be a-- a very important consideration for any planet designers. Your climate is gonna affect the inhabitability of your planet. If your planet is too smooth, that's another that can cause winds to get everywhere. The Earth has an incredibly complex biosphere and, you know, the varia-- variation in the Earth's weather is caused by its lovely complex landscape, its variation in height, variation in temperature, uh, and its large but not, you know, total co-- covering of seas. So, th-- these *are* considerations that one designing a planet would have to make. If-- [__BEN:__ You'd think.]If we were doing it for real.

#### BEN

Oh, right.

#### TIM

Which we are! [__BEN:__ Are on *TV.*]

#### BRYN

Uh, okay, so we-- we-- we've started to talk about atmospheric, uh, science, the atmospheric effect on some of the planets. So, we've-- we've got an issue here. Uh, let's go to my favorite planet that Stellar Firma have designed. [__TIM:__ Ooh.] In my in-character persona, as Lorek Brynison, King of the Armoured Bears of Svalbard, [__TIM:__ Mhm, mhm.] I've ordered a planet myself from the crack design team of, uh, Trexel Geistman and David-7 and what I got was not up to specifications.

#### TIM

Er, well, __[BEN:__ Uh, well...] complaints are really not where we, um...

#### BEN

Yeah, you'd have to talk to the legal department.

#### TIM

__[sucks in a breath]__ Yeah, uh...

#### BRYN

So, let's-- let's-- can-- can we try to explain the science behind the robot-- the roaming robot accountants [__TIM:__ Yes.] and how exactly they are warming the planet?

#### BEN

Well, 'cause they're radiators, [__TIM:__ They're radiators, yeah.] radiators are warm, so, there.

#### TIM

Yeah. Yeah, two plus two equals... water.

#### BRYN

Well, I think again we've-- we've got a slightly fai-- a failure of our imagination on-- on-- in terms of scale here. [__TIM:__ Sure.] A planet is *very,* very large. [__BEN:__ There are a lot of accountants! There are loads of them.] How-- how big are these robots? How much heat [__TIM:__ Yeah, yeah, they're regular--] are the heat robots generating?

#### TIM

They're regular accountant size. Let's say, five foot eight? You know, they're not* really* tall, because otherwise, they wouldn't have been accountants. So they're about five foot eight-- apologies to any accountants listening, you're very average in height-- __[Bryn laughs]__ um, they're about five foot eight, uh-- take that, you averagely-heighted people! Um, uh, so, yeah they're about five foot eight, uh, a hundred and eighty pounds-- I-- I don't know why I used pounds, I have no idea __[laughs]__ how heavy people are in pounds. Uh, twelve and a half stone, let's say, uh, yeah! It's all regular accountants!

#### BRYN

Sure, um--

#### BEN

But there are millions of them.

#### TIM

*Millions* of them! Like crow-- like-- like passenger pigeons in pre-nineteenth century America.

#### BRYN

I mean, there's-- there's what? Seven point four-- seven point five billion humans on Earth?

#### BEN

Yeah.

#### TIM

Mhm?

#### BRYN

H-- how-- how much heat do you think the heat that humans generate contributes to the like general atmospheric condition of the planet Earth?

#### BEN

_[crosstalk]_ Uh, no, no, no, I don't know about this. Sorry-- it's-- ah, well, you know.

#### TIM [crosstalk]

Ah! Oh, Bryn, Bryn, Bryn. Yes, yes.

#### BRYN

Oh, am I being interrupted? Okay, okay then. Please-- please-- please explain for me.

#### TIM

_[crosstalk]_ Take-- Take this, Ben. Take-- Take him down a peg or two. __[laughs]__

#### BEN

Yeah, so, so please-- w-- wh-- remember what you just said? 'The amount of heat that humans give off.' These accountants are *literally* radiators.

#### TIM

Actual radiators. Actual--

#### BEN

It's in the name! They radiate.

#### BRYN [crosstalk]

So how hot is each individual accountant?

#### BEN

Well, they're probably... I'd say, about a hundred and fifty degrees but what we do is-- remember, they were there to make creeks-- um, so what you do is you* group* accountants together at the source of a-- a creek you wish to make and you would place them at regular intervals just to keep the water flowing.

#### TIM

And I would say, there's actually-- there's precedent in nature for this, um, in the humble bee. Uh, in the-- __[Bryn laughs]__ Consider the humble bee, Bryn!

#### BRYN [crosstalk]

Amazing. Please. Please.

#### TIM

Uh, because bees will all cluster together and vibrate in order to create heat, uh, for various purposes, one of which is to kill intruders, so if a hornet, say, gets into a bees nest, they all-- they all cluster around the hornet and-- and-- and grab together and vibrate and, uh, the heat cooks the hornet. So, that's art imitating life.

#### BRYN

I mean, zoology-- zoology is-- is-- is a very far cry from my area of expertise but I have also read this so I have to-- I have to concede you a point there, I suppose. Um--

#### BEN

Fundamentally, what happens in the accountants get around the source of the river and just... and just vibrate!

#### TIM

Just vibrate.

#### BEN

Just vibrate.

#### TIM

Yes, the, uh-- their heat is generated by vibration-- did we not mention this? __[laughs]__

#### BEN

Yes __[laughs]__

#### BRYN

Well, I mean, the accountants causing rivers to start flowing is realistic. However-- __[Ben and Tim burst out laughing]__

#### BEN

We did it! We did it to him! We can wrap it up!

#### TIM

_[crosstalk]_ You call yourself a scientist! __[laughs]__

#### BRYN

I think we-- I think we really need to bear in mind that the general climate condition of a planet is controlled by the s-- how much energy the sun is providing, and the thickness and composition of the atmosphere. Unless you're covering your *entire* planet in a multilayered city, __[Tim laughs]__ I'm not sure the actual contents of the planet are gonna have a big effect on the-- on the overall climate condition.

#### TIM

Tell me this--

#### BEN [crosstalk]

Well, no no, but we weren't affecting-- Oh whoops-- no, you go, Tim, sorry.

#### TIM

No, sorry-- okay, thank you. Um, I was gonna give it back to you-- no, no, I want to say my thing. __[Ben chuckles]__ So-- Consider this: So if it is, uh, the case that in this planet it is just over the edge into being icy, there's snow, there's ice on the ground, y' know permafrost, let's say, so it's just over into that. Y'know it's not the Arctic, but it's-- it's sort of relatively into there, and then you have many, many millions of hot water sources all flowing into the sea, and water has very good, um, thermal, uh... retention ability, y' know, if it gets hot it remains hot for quite a while. So if you have constantly hot water pouring into the sea, even if it's-- they're now-- that's gonna raise the overall temperature and it's gonna remain-- remain liquid, surely.

#### BRYN

Uh, again the question is scale here--

#### TIM

There's so many of them, Bryn!

#### BRYN

-- And the temperature of an individual river...

#### BEN

*I* think Bryn is actually missing on the real question, which is: "How do we power these accountants?", which we never answered. I assume you just plug them into the wall.

#### TIM [nonchalant]

Yeah, you plug them into the wall. __[Bryn laughs]__

#### BEN

Which wall? Who knows, but yeah. __[Bryn continues laughing]__

#### TIM

Yeah, the wall.

#### BEN

It's actually their briefcase. They plug themselves in at their briefcase and then...

#### TIM

Yeah.

#### BRYN

Yeah, I do remember that the-- their briefcases being the power sources. That does seem to be the general consensus.

#### BEN [crosstalk]

Did they have small nuclear generators? I can't remember.

#### TIM

Yeah! Yeah. Yeah, yeah, that would-- that would be the most, sort of, stable and-- and long-lasting, yes. Small onboard power station, *and* because they're in water, that's the cooling system.

#### BEN

There we go.

#### TIM

Which we do unfortunately get into a slight illogical cycle there because they heat the water but the water's also the cooling system for the battery system that allows them to heat the water. __[takes a deep breath]__ So, if they're too good... meltdown.

#### BRYN

Yeah... I think-- I-- I-- See, another thing that would be important, if we were to understand the real science behind these designs, would be to establish how much of the planetary surface is covered by water, and how much is covered by land.

#### BEN

So that depends actually on how much the polar bears want to do business.

#### TIM

Yes, how much business do you want to do, Bryn?

#### BRYN

_[crosstalk]_ Of course, of course. Very little, ideally.

#### BEN

Okay, so only like two or three creeks.

#### TIM

Yeah, two or three creeks!

#### BEN [crosstalk]

Just enough to have a few business meetings but not too much.

#### BRYN

Sure, sure...

#### TIM [crosstalk]

Now let's say--

#### BEN

_[crosstalk]_ Now, if you want to do more business? Well...

#### BRYN

That's fair. That's fair

#### TIM

Let's say-- let's say it's the size of the Earth, you've got Lake Victoria. Everything else is land. You know, it's a *lot* of water*,* but in comparison to the size of the planet, not that much.

#### BRYN

That's-- that's a-- that is a fair point. Lake Victoria is very small... compared to the size of Earth.

#### BEN

That's a true fact, Tim stated there. A true, unequivocal fact.

#### BRYN

I can't disagree with you. I can't disagree with you. __[Tim laughs]__

Uh, okay, so I think-- I think you've answered my questions about the polar bear planet. Now, one of your planets did have a* significant* amount of the surface covered in lava.

#### BEN

Yes.

#### TIM

All! All, I believe! Oh, no, apart from the bit that's covered in marmalade.

#### BRYN

There was a bit that was also covered in-- in... marmalade.

#### TIM

Yes.

#### BRYN

Now, early on in the life cycle of a rocky planet, we believe that they were indeed, mostly, a surface of lava. __[TIM:__ Mm-hm.__]__ Do you guys have any sort of, uh, ballpark estimates of how hot *lava* is in general.

#### TIM

Oh, uh, Ben?

#### BEN

Uh, I'd like to go for about 1200°

#### TIM

I'm gonna go for 'it depends on what's melted'.

#### BEN

Ooh!

#### TIM

Oof.

#### BRYN

Uh, I mean, 1200° is-- is a pretty good number. __[BEN:__ Yes! Yes!__]__ It's actually at the low end. I mean, obviously, lava, as we think of it--

#### TIM [forcefully]

*It depends what has melted.*

#### BRYN

Uh... There-- I mean, there is a sense of that! I mean, l-- lava is-- is essentially a term for liquid rock, um, rock. [__TIM:__ Mhm.] There are different types of rock with different melting points. So in __[TIM:__ Two points to Tim.__]__ another sense--I think-- I think there's a point each for you there.

#### TIM

Oh yes! __[Ben chuckles]__

#### BRYN

Now, obviously lava, as we think of it, is molten rock that has come out above the surface of the Earth and is, therefore, cooling rapidly, so actually to say "the temperature of lava"... is a slightly weird thing because it's changing rapidly because it's cooling because it's so much hotter and everything.

#### BEN

__[in a sarcastic, know-it-all tone]__ Should we have said the temperature of magma?

#### BRYN

So the temperature of magma, indeed, can be hotter than, uh, 1200°, in fact, and if the entire surface of your planet is lava then the lava is not hitting other things to cool down. So, in fact, an entirely lava-covered planet, uh, is likely to be a little bit hotter than lava, uh, on Earth. You'll notice that 1200° if we're taking that as the, uh-- the temperature figure, which seems reasonable, is not* quite* within what we referred to earlier as the Goldilocks Zone.

#### TIM

Yes.

#### BEN

I'll refer you to the fact that everyone who went on that planet died.

#### TIM

Died. Yeah, that was part of the design. __[laughs]__ It was somewhat of a murder planet.

#### BEN

Very-- We really pushed it towards Papa Bear on that one. __[Tim laughs]__

#### BRYN

Yeah. Yeah, I mean in that sense--

#### TIM [laughing]

Beyond Papa Bear in the Goldilocks Zone. __[Ben laughs]__

#### BRYN

In that sense, the-- the science was accurate. __[Ben snorts, Tim laughs]__ You did make a planet where literally everyone who went there died.

#### TIM

_[crosstalk]_ Yeah! Asked and answered.

#### BEN [crosstalk]

And established that lava is hot.

#### BRYN

You know, I thought-- I thought I was criticizing your planetary design skills, but I have-- I have no ability to criticize your planetary evaluation skills. __[Ben laughs]__ They have all been, all been disasters.

#### BEN

So we don't know what we're making, but we know when it's bad.

#### TIM

Yeah! Yeah.

#### BRYN

Apparently so.

#### TIM

Exactly.

#### BRYN

I can't remember the-- the mechanism by which you had marmalade existing next to lava.

#### TIM

Well, that-- there's an important point that the reason you don't remember the mechanism is because we didn't put one in.

#### BEN

Yeah.

#### TIM

Is the short answer. But I--

#### BEN

Although, I--

#### TIM [crosstalk]

Yeah, go on.

#### BEN [crosstalk]

Go for it.

#### TIM [crosstalk]

No, go on.

__BEN__:__ [crosstalk]__ No-- Okay.

#### TIM [crosstalk]

No, no, no, you.

#### BEN

Okay, so because they entered the planet from, I think, either orbital drop ship or... a big slide, um, both of those things are above the surface of the planet and when you're leaving your kids somewhere, you usually leave them at the entrance, which implies that the actual marmalade cresh is actually not on the surface of the planet.

#### TIM

Good points. Good points.

#### BEN

Which is why those children lived to be orphans. [__TIM:__ They lived.]

#### BRYN

Sure, so the marmalade playpen was in orbit of the planet somehow?

#### TIM AND BEN

Yeah, probably. Why not?

#### BRYN

Like a dedicated moon or something of that type.

#### TIM

Well, no there is, sort of, a mothership that also had quite a-- quite a large burns unit, uh--

#### BEN

Yes!

#### BRYN

Uh, yes I remember the burns unit now, yep.

#### BEN

An inadequate burns unit as it, uh, transpired. __[Tim laughs]__

#### TIM

Yes! Well, you know what? It's a burns unit, not a 'you've literally liquified immediately unit'. __[Ben laughs]__ That's not-- You've not *burnt*, you've *died*.

#### BEN

Oh, yes that is a different unit.

#### TIM [laughing]

It's a different unit.

#### BRYN

That's, yeah that's a title for it. Burns unit is-- is gonna be entirely necessary on a lava planet. So we've talked a lot about the different, uh, the different heating mechanisms we've used for planets-- the different-- uh, and this very important fact about, um, providing energy to the surface of the planet, and now-- now we're gonna come-- we're running a bit low on time, so we're now gonna get onto my own personal biggest problem so far: Miniature suns.

#### BEN

Okay. Okay, just very quickly, I am not gonna answer any of these questions, because I'm pretty sure David's reaction to that is, "...Really? Miniature suns?" So I'm with you on this one.

#### TIM

Alright, I stand alone.

#### BRYN

Oh, well okay, so Ben-- Ben has abdicated all responsibility, __[TIM: [laughs]__ Coward!__]__ so we'll-- we'll let Tim attempt, *attempt*, to justify *miniature suns.*

#### TIM

Okay. I have two theories, and I'll start with the-- __[Bryn and Ben laugh]__ And I'll start with the one that I feel is more credible. Uh--

#### BEN

It's gonna blow our goddamned mind. __[Tim laughs]__

#### TIM

I'm gonna redefine science for you. So, okay, so... Um, so a sun-- a sun is a large obj-- I don't think they have to be large-- do you know actually-- No, my first question to you. First question: Is a sun defined by its... well a sun is actually not a definition, as I understand it, it's a star. A sun is just what we call* our* star __[BRYN:__ Yes. Yes.__]__ So a star: Is it defined-- Is it defined by its size?

#### BRYN

Um...

#### TIM

Fundamentally. Is it-- Is there such a thing as 'this is too small to be a star'?

#### BRYN [slowly]

Yes. Now, not inherently. The limit on the size of a star... It's not just 'when it gets too small we call it something else'__ [TIM:__ Okay__.]__ It's that to be a star, it has to be undergoing the process of nuclear fusion, and--

#### TIM

Okay, well I won't go any further, because that-- this is where my answer lies.

#### BRYN

Sure.

#### TIM

So, I contend that what happens with a star is that there's so much gravity going on all over the place, that it's all really hot and dense because when things are dense they're hot, and when they're hot-- __[BRYN:__ Accurate.__]__ Yeah. So when things are dense they're hot, so it's not about anything other than density. So, if the star is made out of a much denser material than your regular-sized star, then despite the fact it's quite small, __[Ben laughs]__ you've still got that level of density that means it's all melted! And therefore it's a star.

#### BEN [holding back laughter]

Tim-- Tim--

#### TIM

Yes?

#### BEN

Okay, very quickly, you're right about the __[snorts]__ the heat thing-- Okay, what's the other property of density that we have talked about earlier on this episode?

#### TIM [holding back laughter]

I don't remember.

#### BEN

'Kay. Gravity, right?

#### TIM

Yes.

#### BEN

Do-- Do you know what happens when you get something that's, like, *so* dense?

#### TIM

Have I created a black hole?

#### BEN

A very small one.

#### TIM

Is a small star a black hole? __[BEN:__ You've--__]__

#### BRYN [pleased]

A small, incredibly dense star is, in fact, a black hole.

#### TIM

God damn it!

#### BRYN

Yes! __[they all laugh]__ Can I-- Can I just get you to suggest, Tim, how effective a set of miniature black holes would be at providing heat and light to a planet?

#### TIM

Um, I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that black holes are not conducive to *emitting* heat and light. They're much more in the business of sucking it in.

#### BRYN

I mean, as someone with a Master's Degree, very specifically in black holes, I totally agree with that statement.

#### TIM

Is there a way __[Ben and Bryn laugh]__ of-- of-- and I'm maybe asking a question that can't be answered!-- is there a way of having a black hole-- so-- so there is a point where a star turns from a star into a black hole, or at least where it decides 'am I gonna be a black hole? Am I gonna be a Red Dwarf? What am I doing here?'

#### BRYN

Yes! So, uh, very-- very-- very briefly, if a star is essentially too small to become a star at the beginning, then it will be a gas giant. So there are very large gas giant planets. Jupiter, for example, is actually not very far away, in the grand scheme of things, from being big enough to become a star. [__TIM:__ Sure.] Um, stars get much, much bigger than our Sun. Uh, they can be huge, commonly at the end of the life cycle of a star, they do collapse inwards due to their own gravity, and then there are two distinct types of very small, very dense stars. One is called a neutron star. It's not really a star anymore 'cause it's no longer emitting heat and light, but it's called a neutron star, and it's slightly less dangerous than a black hole but on the scale we're talking about, the gravitational effect of putting a neutron star or a black hole near a planet would both be *extremely* apocalyptic-- which is not a phrase I thought I would say because--

#### TIM

Would-- would it *tear* your matter apart at its very fundamental level?

#### BRYN

Maybe not at the fundamental level, but certainly at the macroscopic level [__TIM:__ Sure.] a-- and possibly... yes, e-- even at a microscopic level.

#### TIM

_[crosstalk]_ Your hands would fall off. I can't handstand.

#### BRYN

I-- I-- Yeah, your body would be rapidly ripped apart.

#### TIM

So can bacteria survive black holes?

#### BRYN

__[takes a breath, as if considering it]__ No.

#### TIM [disappointed]

Aw. __[huffs a laugh]__

#### BRYN

The only thing that can survive black holes is-- is... *atomic* matter.

#### TIM

Okay. So when you say micro, you mean-- you mean *really* micro--

#### BRYN

And when I say 'survive', I mean this is a very complex, uh...

#### TIM

__[snickers]__ Yeah, 'cause 'survive' is not necessarily-- it's a term of life. 'Look, this proton has survived!' Well, I mean, it wasn't really... *alive*.

#### BRYN

I mean-- I mean, anyone-- anyone who wants-- anyone who wants to understand Hawking Radiation, uh, get in touch with me later and I'll send you a copy of my master's dissertation, [__TIM:__ Wow!] 'cause that's really the level we're talking about, when we're talking about the relationship black holes have with atomic or subatomic matter. Let's leave that for another time, perhaps. But yes, uh, fundamentally, uh, so-- so Tim, you-- you were about to propose some form of alternative--

#### TIM

Yes, yes.

#### BRYN

--for neutron stars and black holes.

#### TIM

Yes. My alternative is: You just take a little scoop of an existing sun. There you go! Little sun! Just take a little scoop of it. __[Ben laughs]__ Like a big ball-- like a lemon baller! A lemon baller? A melon baller! You just sort of, like-- 'Whoops, there it is!' And then, you know, what's it gonna do, run away? It's the sun, it's just a little tiny chunk of sun!

#### BRYN

This is-- this is-- this is very close to a good idea. __[they all laugh]__

#### BEN

Well, that's the most shocking thing I've heard.

#### TIM

Wowee! Why don't-- Why is it that my outlandish stupidity is closer to science than my considered answer? __[Ben chuckles]__

#### BRYN

Well, uh, a little ball of sun matter: Great, yeah, that's a perfect, uh, thing to use as a fuel for a fusion reaction. The problem is, as we-- as we said just-- just now, um, you really need the heat and density provided by the *huge mass* of the star to make it hot enough for nuclear fusion to occur, and it's nuclear fusion which gives out that energy. [__TIM:__ Sure.] So, the issue you've got with your little melon ball of star stuff is that it's a great fuel *but* you essentially need to have it reach a certain temperature before it will start producing energy. Now, if you're scooping it directly out of a sun, and you can keep it going, who-- who are we to say what *ridiculous*... sci-fi level technology Stellar Firma has access to? If they can make planets, maybe they can! Maybe they can scoop a small ball of star matter directly out of the upper layer of a star and just put in a containment field, and have it be a self-sustaining nu-- nuclear fusion reaction.

#### TIM

I have a theory. I have a theory for this. Is there... an astronomical... thing-- and I'm using the science word of 'thing'-- __[Bryn laughs]__ I want-- I want to say black hole but I mean black hole in the terms of 'sci-fi teleportation hole'. Is there, like, a-- is there a thing through which gravity can act and sort of, like, there are two-- there are two separate points in space but gravity's acting through them as if it's some sort of doorway? Is-- Is *that*... a thing?

#### BRYN

You're asking-- You're asking if wormholes exist.

#### TIM

__[without missing a beat]__ Do wormholes exist?

#### BRYN

__[sucks in a breath]__ No.

#### TIM

Well, that makes my second half difficult. __[laughs]__

#### BEN

Well, we can get-- we can get into quantum, right?

#### BRYN

I mean-- it-- it-- it's actually a much more complex answer than that. The answer is: 'If a wormhole *began*, the rules-- the laws of physics allow it to continue to exist,--

#### TIM

But 'how does it start', is the question.

#### BRYN

'--But how does it start?' [__TIM:__ Okay.] A-- and currently, we can't think of a way, unless you have *negative* mass, which, as far as we can tell, doesn't exist in the universe.

#### TIM

Sure. Well, let's-- let's say, you found one. Maybe, in this--

#### BRYN

I mean, we have control of-- we know we have gravitational control technology at Stellar Firma Ltd.

#### TIM

True. Very true.

#### BRYN

So, sure! Let's-- we-- that-- let's use that to make some negative mass, create a wormhole.

#### TIM

Yeah, yeah, so we've got one.

#### BRYN [crosstalk]

Fantastic!

#### TIM

So what you do, is you take your little scoop of sun, and then you plonk it on top of a wormhole and the other side of the wormhole is-- is in-- in the-- in the existing mother sun, and, therefore, it's sort of the-- the gravity and, therefore, density that you would need and-- it's all coming through the wormhole, basically.

#### BRYN

Uh, unfortunately, you have just connected your sun [__TIM:__ Yes.] via wormhole to your planet and a-- as previously stated, gravitational effects--

#### TIM [crosstalk]

Yeah, it would get transferred through the wormhole

#### BRYN [crosstalk] --

would transfer through the wormhole--

#### TIM [crosstalk]

Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, I understand.

#### BRYN [crosstalk]

--Pretty much, yep.

#### TIM [laughs]

Alright! Fair enough! [__BRYN:__ So--] Well, you know what? If you don't ask, you don't get, Bryn. So...

#### BRYN

I mean, again, you-- you're thinking, you-- you're being creative, you-- you-- you're close to a good idea, in fact. __[Ben chuckles]__ Um, so, we're practically out of time, but I will mention that the idea that-- that Tim is... *blindly* grasping towards is pretty similar, uh, to the nuclear fusion experiments that *have* been going on for the last 30-40 years in terms of generating a self-sustaining nuclear fusion reaction in a reactor on Earth as a form of power generation. Now, this is a technology that, uh, we haven't mastered and, y-- you know, reports have been saying, 'Oh, it's about 30 years away for about 40 years now.'

#### TIM

Yeah, and for some reason, those messages are coming from 80 years __[Bryn chuckles]__ in the past, something's gone very-- it's real weird over there. Something's wrong.

#### BRYN

But there-- there-- there is a form of nuclear fusion technology that essentially takes a bunch of... star matter i.e. hydroge-- mostly hydrogen and helium, um, [__TIM: [quietly]__ A scoop.] ...a scoop of star matter, contains it in a *very* strong, uh, magnetic field, which both keeps it in place and causes it to spin, and *in theory*, if you can get the magnetic field to do both those things *strongly* enough, you could achieve a contained, self-sustaining fusion reaction. So, we're not too far away from our idea of-- our idea of 'little miniature suns'.

#### TIM

Well there you go! So, what you're saying is, I'm correct.

#### BRYN

I think-- if we've learned anything in today's, uh, special on the science of Stellar Firma, it's that *you* are correct approximately ⅕ as often as Ben is.

#### TIM

Ah, I'd say that seems about right!

#### BEN

That, uh-- I think that's, uh-- we fit our roles as __[Bryn and Tim laugh]__ David and Trexel at that point. Also, it's perfectly viable, because as we know, Stellar Firma *does* happen *at least* 30 years into the future [__TIM:__ Yeah, at least, at the very least.] so we will have nuclear fusion by then.

#### BRYN

Again, another good point, yeah. If-- if-- if fusion technology is 30 years away, we are forced to assume that Stellar Firma has access to it.

#### BEN

Unless those scientists are *liars*!

#### TIM

Quick-- Quick-- Just a real quick one before we end, Bryn, because I do appreciate that we are out of time. Um, what's time travel and how does it work? Just quickly-- Just quickly-- Just quickly. How-- how does time travel-- how does it work?

#### BRYN

It doesn't.

#### TIM

Okay, well, there you go! Asked and answered.

#### BRYN

Tha-- thanks, guys! __[Ben laughs, Tim wheezes]__ Thanks-- Thanks for joining me today, I hope you enjoyed our little chat. Uh, listeners let us know what you thought, let us know if you've got any, uh, follow-up questions, uh, I'm generally found hanging around the Discord, at all hours of the day and night, and let us know if you enjoyed this special, maybe we can do, uh, another one at the end of the next season, uh, if we've got anything more to say, and if, uh, any of us have felt like, uh, taking the time to prepare notes for that one and actually have the ability to talk about stuff with *some* knowledge of things that happened more than a week ago. __[Tim giggles]__

#### TIM

Well, we can __[Ben snorts]__ but dream, Bryn! We can but dream.

#### BRYN

I mean, I imagine that terminology is at least 30 years away, to be honest.

#### TIM

_[crosstalk]_ *At least,* at least 30.

#### BEN [crosstalk]

Yeah, no, certainly, definitely.

#### TIM

But this show does take place 30 years into the future so, you know, it's fine! It's fine. It's fine.

#### BRYN

Thank you very much for joining us everyone, uh, and I hope we'll see you all back for the, uh, *soon* to arrive Season 2 of Stellar Firma!

#### TIM

Bye, everybody. Have a *chill* day!

#### BEN

Goodbye, funky people. [__TIM:__ Funksters.]

#### TIM

See you... smooth. Very smooth! __[laughs]__

#### BRYN [crosstalk]

Bye guys.

#### BEN [crosstalk]

Funky...
