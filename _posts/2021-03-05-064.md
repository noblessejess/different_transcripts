Special thanks to Nikolaj Ravn Jørgensen. If you replace all the boards and rigging, it's no longer your father's ship, and the law can't touch you.

##### [show theme]

#### IMOGEN

Rusty Quill presents: Stellar Firma.

##### [theme continues]

#### DAVID

_(quietly)_ 'Kay then, __[beeping]__ yeah, okay, I think I've got it. If we, if we go there, there's--

##### [approaching footsteps, followed by door whooshing]

#### TREXEL

David! __[David makes a startled noise]__ David, David, David. David, David, David, David. [__DAVID:__ Yep. Yeah, what's up?] How are you doing?

#### DAVID

Oh yeah, no, fine, fine. __[beeping sounds]__

#### TREXEL

Yep, you alright there David? [__DAVID:__ Yeah.] Crouched over your controls there. __[false laughter]__ Sh-Shouldn't really be touching them, so I don't know __[high-pitched beeping as David works at the controls]__ what you're doing over there, but I... I-- __[sighs]__ Before-- David, before we get into things--

#### DAVID

__[distracted as computer beeps again]__ Uh-huh.

#### TREXEL

I, I ju- I was just-- David, can you sort of turn and look at me? Just a bit? I can-- David?

#### DAVID

_(still distracted)_ Uh, uh-huh.

#### TREXEL

David, I was wondering, you were--

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Saving schematic.

#### DAVID

Oh! Sorry. __[machinery powering down]__ Yes, what, what's, what's, what's up.

#### TREXEL

Thank you, thank you for, __[false laughter]__ f-foracknowledging me, David, your better, you s--your superior, so, thank you for turning around. Uh, I was just wanting to ask you a question.

#### DAVID

Mm-hmm.

#### TREXEL

You were talking yesterday about how there are many, many more clones than people on Stellar Firma. Apart from disabusing you of your stupid, stupid plans about a clone revolution, I completely forgot to ask *how* you knew that. Because that, David, is exactly the kind of information that should not be available to, to most people, let alone a clone. So I'd just like you to quickly, just tell me, David, how, how it is you knew about the clone population ratio thing?

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Uh oh! It seems the slowest ship in the uptake race has crawled across the finish line.

#### DAVID

Uhhh, __[burbles for a moment]__ don't.

#### TREXEL

You, you don't? [__DAVID:__ No.] You don't know about it? So, so you told that to me, but you don't know?.

#### DAVID

_(stalling)_ Uhh... probably dreamed it.

#### TREXEL

You dream-- Oh, you dream-- Well, you know, we can but dream, except that clones can't dream, David. Clones just *aren't*,whilst they're off, so... as I think, David, I think, you, despite our conversation and what I thought was an understanding we had, have been using IMOGEN and your universal permissions, which we [__DAVID:__ What--] expressly discussed *you should not use* due to its ability to get us all found out and *murdered*. But it seems you have used them, David, so I'm just gonna look you in the eye and say: David, have you been using universal permissions to gain access to information you shouldn't?

#### DAVID

Yes, obviously.

#### TREXEL

_(irate)_ Oh David!

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ It is astounding how obvious this has been for quite some time.

#### TREXEL

Oh David, okay. I'm not cross, [__DAVID:__ Uh, good--] I'm *furious*! I'm *so angry!* I'm not angry at you, I'm angry at *you!*

#### DAVID

Okay?

#### TREXEL

This is exactly how-- You are constantly, David, constantly needling me, and, and nurdling me, and wheedling me, and wordeling me, about how *I'm* going to get us all killed, and then you, once again, do the one thing that is the most surefire way of alerting-- [__DAVID:__ Yeah.]

If you do something on IMOGEN, using your secret special permissions, that are totally out of the range of your standing and your abilities, people are going to notice!

#### DAVID

Well, they haven't so far!

#### TREXEL

Like Standards! Haven't they, David? Haven't they? Because last time I checked, you're having weekly tea parties with Standards!

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Oh dear. I hate it when Trexel makes a good point. It just throws off my whole day.

#### DAVID

Uh-- Well, I-- [__TREXEL:__ Uh, what?] Okay, to, to be honest, I thought--

#### TREXEL

*(overlapping)* What's that? Is that the sound of me being right, David?

#### DAVID

No, I-I actually think that's kind of an, a different thing entirely.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Or it could be two ends of the same thing.

#### TREXEL

__[muttering]__ I seem to disagree with you. Hang on, let me just check my notes. Uh, the notes are in my face, I'm looking at my face-- I disagree, David. [__DAVID:__ No, well look--] I think they're *exactly* the same thing.

#### DAVID

*(overlapping)* Okay, also, sorry-- *I* have a problem with *you* for endangering *my* life, mainly, my life, for no good reason apart from your own selfish interests. I--

#### TREXEL

*(overlapping)* Oh, so two wrongs make a right, David? Two wrongs-- Is that what you're saying?

#### DAVID

No, what I'm saying is: my risky activity is for an actual purpose.To actually [__TREXEL:__ I--] do something good, to try and fix things. Not just to try and... well, I don't even know what you're, what you're trying to do, but just, t-to not do whatever you're trying to do, to do whatever I'm trying to do, which is actually *help* people.

#### TREXEL

And what *have* you achieved, David? Tell me now. After you've done all of this dangerous, risky business stuff, what have you actually achieved?

#### DAVID

Ha ha ha ha. Aha ha ha ha ha.

#### TREXEL

Oh, no, no, don't, don't wag your fing-- __[David continues laughing gleefully]__ No, David, this is wei-- No, okay, okay, getting a bit manic, David.

#### DAVID

I'll tell you what I've found out. Item the first: I found out where the clones are stored. Item the second: I found out there are more clones than citizens in Stellar Firma. Item the third: I've worked out a way to get us to Clone Storage.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Stop listing your seditious plans out loud. Not reporting them takes up a lot of processing power.

#### TREXEL

But David, that's pointless! We've discussed this. We may as well visit a room full of melons for all the revolutionary good they'll do!

#### DAVID

You say "melons", but I exist.

#### TREXEL

Yes, and you are a rebellious, rambunctious little weirdo.

#### DAVID

Uh-huh. And I am David. So. Item the fourth: I have found out particularly where they keep the Davids. And if I can persuade me, because I'm me, to do something, then maybe all of the 'mes' can then persuade all of the 'thems'. The 'thems' being the other clones, you see.

#### TREXEL

I, I do see, David, but I think, once again, I'm going to have to just really flag up that you are a freakish aberration. I don't think that the other Davids are like you. I think the other Davids might look like you, they might smell like you, they might have that same stupid haircut, they might be also slimy, slimy boys, but I don't think they're revolutionaries waiting to happen! I think they are eggs in a carton, waiting to be smashed!

#### DAVID

You come with me __[Trexel begins to make sounds of disagreement as David speaks]__ and we'll, we'll show you the smashable eggs, and then those eggs will smash you!

#### TREXEL

No, David, I am not, I'm not going to, I'm not going-- What an invitation, for a start. 'Come to my room, you'll be smashed like an egg.'

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Egg-based seduction detected. Security prepping their omelette pans.

#### TREXEL

I am not joining you on this hare-brained scheme.

#### DAVID

What if I told you we were leaving very, very soon, and we could clock off the shift early to go there.

#### TREXEL

Oh, well, now that's very interesting. So you're saying we just really rush this brief. [__DAVID:__ Oh yeah, just, just--] Really just hash out something quick, and then, uh, and then be not here at work.

#### DAVID

Exactly. So just, just--

#### TREXEL

Oh, that's quite the proposition, David. Hang on, let me just, um. _(mutters to himself)_ Stupid, stupid idea. Stupid clone idea, but I do _(chuckling)_ like not being-- Alright, David, I'm on board!

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ The rock of self-preservation, smashed by the hammer of laziness.

#### DAVID

So let's get the brief. __[pneumatic tube hissing]__ Okay, so, so this one is from--

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Initiating.

#### DAVID

Um, The Supreme Blagwith. Uh, pronouns are "The Supreme Blagwith", or "it/its, if you must". Uh, uh, it's "External Seeking Wisdom", and The Supreme Blagwith is, is writing to us from the Church-Factory of the Supreme Blagwith.

#### TREXEL

Ah, a venerable institution doing good works across the galaxy.

#### DAVID

Okay, well, let's just have a read. Okay, so, so: "My worshiper employees are simply not dying... fast enough."

#### TREXEL

Ah, it happens to the best of us.

#### DAVID

"The Church Factory is overflowing with people, and they keep going on about how they 'don't want to die' or 'please, I have a family,' and hiding."

#### TREXEL

Ha ha, from your mouth to The Supreme Blagwith's ears.

#### DAVID

_(disheartened)_ Um, and its final question is, "How do I make my worshiper-employees die more efficiently?"

#### TREXEL

Well, you know what? I'm glad we've got this one, because not only can we half-ass it, it's a really simple solution. A big grinder. Move on.

#### DAVID

Are we, we're, we're really, we're really just gonna answer this question which is specifically about 'how do I do murder better?'

#### TREXEL

It's not murder, David, if they're your followers as part of your, __[chuckles]__ now, people don't like this term, but cult. It's a cult, David. Nothing wrong with a cult. I was in a cult. I've founded a cult. We've all had a cult. So, y'know, it-- If, if they're, if they're following you, then, y'know, grind 'em up. They knew what they were signing up for. The Church of the Supreme Blagwith is very clear about its tenets. "We are in the soul production business, you are the product, we need to extract the soul from the body." [__DAVID:__ No, I, f-- I don't--] "Come inside, we've got juice."

#### DAVID

But I don't care about the tenets. Because if you're grinding the tenants up, then your tenets don't matter to the tenants.

#### TREXEL

Hang on. Tenants? As in 'tenants' of a building? Or 'tenants', as in tenets of a religious book?

#### DAVID

Well no, 'cause, 'cause with a religious book you have tenets, not tenants.

#### TREXEL

Oh, tenets!

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Hang on. How does tennis feature into this?

#### DAVID

Okay, okay, so if you've got some tenets about tennis, that your tenants are playing tennis, they need to abide by the tenets, right? [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] Otherwise they will no longer be tennis tenants, see?

#### TREXEL

Fifteen-love.

#### DAVID

You sunk my battleship.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Stop it, both of you.

#### TREXEL

Well, touché!

#### DAVID

Right. But, I don't care about what the tenets of The Supreme Blagwith say when its tenants are being murdered.

#### TREXEL

That's very intolerant of you, David.

#### DAVID

*(overlapping)* They are its-- No, b-b-but--

#### TREXEL

That's very intolerant of you. You don't think the church-factories of The Supreme Blagwith deserve its beliefs? Is that what you're saying? Oh, David 7, knows better! 'Don't kill them, that's wrong!' says you, [__DAVID:__ But, but, but if they're taught--] and who are you, David, but a slimy dot on the ass of the universe?

#### DAVID

But if The Supreme Blagwith's tenants are saying things like "I don't want to die" and "Please, I have a family", then they are obviously not on board with the tenets.

#### TREXEL

That's just classic buyer's remorse, David. You know, just because you bought a space cruiser, and then like, 'Oh no, I'm in so much debt!' doesn't mean you don't still own the space cruiser. [__DAVID:__ So you deser--] And you gotta pay, you gotta pay for mooring fees, for repainting, for proton spray. It's all your fault, [__DAVID:__ Okay Trexel.] just cause you've changed your mind.

#### DAVID

Did you, did you buy a space cruiser?

#### TREXEL

A couple. And you know what? They barnacle up so fast. Who'd have thought there'd be so many barnacles in space? [__DAVID:__ Okay.] The space barnacles, that's who.

#### DAVID

And if, and if I told you that you *deserved* all of that debt and misery because you bought them, what would you, what would you say?

#### TREXEL

_(incensed)_ I'll kill you with a hammer! You say that to me? How dare you! Rrra-- _(abruptly calm)_ I see your point there, David, I see your point. Yes.

#### DAVID

Yeah.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ It's Trexel-brand selfish empathy.

#### TREXEL

Yes. It's less 'buyer's remorse' and more 'buyer's righteous anger'. So, in many ways, my not wanting to deal with the consequences of what I've bought, and their wanting to continue to live are totally equal. We're totally equal. Thank you David, thank you for recognizing my plight.

#### DAVID

I think I'm just gonna have to take that one. Uh, yes, and also you're assuming that The Supreme Blagwith has got them into its church-factory honestly.

#### TREXEL

Good point. Is this a free market activity, or is this a fright market activity, where you're like, 'Blah! Get in my church, or I'll kill you!' And then you kill them anyway.

#### DAVID

Precisely. So... answering this question is morally reprehensible.

#### TREXEL

Counterpoint: I think a lot of our questions have been morally reprehensible. And some of our solutions, David, so why are you choosing *now* to stick up for it?

#### DAVID

Because this has a) gone beyond the pale, and b) I've had enough.

#### TREXEL

I mean, I've got a pretty big pail, David. [__DAVID:__ Yes, I know--] The number of cows [__DAVID:__ I know you do.] that would have to be milked to fill my pail is vast, like, what, thirty cows?

#### DAVID

*(overlapping)* I know you do, because Bathin has a safe planet which is lubricated by the corpses of the people who are crushed in the mechanisms because of you.

#### TREXEL

Yes, yes, yes. I actually-- I followed up on that because I wanted to see if Bathin was sad so I could enjoy myself. And _(chuckling)_ it turned out that that planet was designed and delivered, and Bathin was so upset. "This isn't what I wanted! This isn't what I wanted for my people." He was crying. He didn't pay. That's been added to the debt.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ They had to hold a National Day of ["Be cool! Come on! Nice!"](https://youtu.be/gG57WyrSTx8) just to get back on track.

#### DAVID

Right. And so that's where you got with your big pail.

#### TREXEL

Maybe I need a smaller pail, David.

#### DAVID

Maybe you do need a smaller pail.

#### TREXEL

A dainty pail. [__DAVID:__ Yeah.] A dainty pail for Trexel.

#### DAVID

So.

#### TREXEL

Oh! A mere thimbleful of cow's milk for you.

#### DAVID

Fine. A little, a little thimble full of... blood.

#### TREXEL

That's dark, but I like it. Goths, let's go!

#### DAVID

No, n-- Stop it! Okay, so, I have a counter-proposal for what we do with this brief. Which is: we write the top of the brief, and we're like, "Dear The Supreme Blagwith, have you considered a grinder?"

#### TREXEL

Yes, yes. Big, big industrial grinder. [__DAVID:__ And--] 'Did you know Stellar Firma also provides them? Here's the catalogue number.'

#### DAVID

And then, we do like a, we ah, we just leave a big gap, maybe even on the other side of the paper, we say--

#### TREXEL

_(crosstalk)_ 'Fold this.' Under the fold, David. No-one's ever read beyond the fold.

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ Yes, we fold it. Under the fold.

#### DAVID

Okay, and then we say, 'Psst. Worshiper-employees.' [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] 'We have some suggestions on how [__TREXEL:__ Oh!] to deal with The Supreme Blagwith.'

#### TREXEL

Ah! So is this going to be the first example of a, sort of, a double-headed brief for us? One brief for the king, one brief for the peasantry.

#### DAVID

Uh-- __[sighs]__ Well, I mean, phrasing aside, broadly yes.

#### TREXEL

Okay, right, so. One side: 'Here's a grinder! Here's the catalogue number! Ring this number now for a thirty percent off grind coupon!' [__DAVID:__ Yep.] 'Give us the blood back and we'll buy it for, you know, like a buy-back blood scheme!'

#### DAVID

Mm-hmm.

#### TREXEL

Under the fold--

#### DAVID

Yeah, pop pop pop pop pop pop pop.

#### TREXEL

'You need to take up arms against your rulers. Band together, like a group of-- Oh, I don't know, clones! A clone army, rising up to [__DAVID:__ Uh-huh, uh-huh.] destroy their oppressors!'

#### DAVID

Uh-huh, yes.

#### TREXEL

And how do you do this? And how do you do this? You need intel. You get double agents! [__DAVID:__ Yes, yes!] Maybe a line manager, you get a line manager to be a double agent, [__DAVID:__ Yes.] infiltrating the supreme being's inner sanctum--

#### DAVID

*(overlapping)* Yes, s-s-some sort of, some sort of regulatory body within, within the church-factory of The Supreme Blagwith, right, s-- Y'know, s-some sort of Regulations. [__TREXEL:__ Yes, yes!] Y-- So y-you, you get, you get an agent to infiltrate Regulations, [__TREXEL:__ Yes, yes.] find out all of your regulations, right? [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] And then they, they report back to maybe, two of the clones, or may--

#### TREXEL

You don't want it more than two. You don't wanna be more than two.

#### DAVID

No, no, no. So like a little, a little pod. A little pod. Um.

#### TREXEL

A cabal. David, can it be a cabal?

#### DAVID

Yes, s-s-so, so they report back, they report back to a pod, a, a pod of two worshiper-employees, right, and--

#### TREXEL

Yes, nestled like sliced meat inside a warm pita. A kebab cabal!

#### DAVID

Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, so you take this kebab cabal, and you take the infiltrator line manager, and they, they maybe, as, as a sort of front, they open a really cool café [__TREXEL:__ No.] that's called like--

#### TREXEL

No, you've lost me. Why would they do that? [__DAVID:__ But--] That'd be stupid. Running a café? [__DAVID:__ But it's--] That's like the worst thing you could do.

#### DAVID

But it's fun.

#### TREXEL

Run a knife factory!

#### DAVID

Okay, fine, they can run a knife café--

#### TREXEL

*(overlapping)* A bomb sanctuary! [__DAVID:__ A--] A gun crèche.

#### DAVID

A, a bomb sanct-- Wait, is this a sanctuary *for* bombs, or is this--

#### TREXEL

*(overlapping)* 'Every year, thousands of bombs go undropped. Just two credits a month can help us throw these bombs at unsuspecting victims. Call 0-1-800-KABOOM!'

#### DAVID

Am I-- Should I-- Sh-should I ring that number now, or--?

#### TREXEL

No, that's just an example of an infomercial that they could be running.

#### DAVID

*(overlapping)* Oh! Right, okay, sorry. I-- That was very convincing, I-- anyway, yeah, so--

#### TREXEL

*(overlapping)* Thank you! I do telethons, but for me!

#### DAVID

Okay, so, so, so, so, so, so-- so that's that, a-and then, and then you have your, your management mix-up, u-uh, in your kebab cabal, a-and, and then there--

#### TREXEL

This metaphor is totally not convoluted, keep going.

#### DAVID

Yeah, a-and they're in the bomb sanctuary, um, [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] dropping bombs that haven't been dropped, [__TREXEL:__ Could be.] doing good works, I, I guess, [__TREXEL:__ Maybe, I don't know.] a-and, and then they organise a worshiper-employee revolution by travelling to the, the big room where everyone sleeps. And running around and saying, 'Hey, this is rubbish. Let's not do this anymore.'

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ There is a spectre haunting the room. The spectre of an idiot.

#### TREXEL

Yeah.

#### DAVID

And, and all of the other worshiper-employees, as we shall see, are like, 'Great idea, I'm gonna do exactly that, thank you very much.'

#### TREXEL

A plan so simple, it's almost idiotic.

#### DAVID

Rude, but, I'm not gonna write that bit. So, good?

#### TREXEL

Done. Done. [__DAVID:__ Done?] That's the quickest bit of work I've ever done. [__DAVID:__ Alright.] I'm ready to clock off for the day. Submit it, get rid.

##### [writing sounds as David completes the brief]

#### DAVID

*(overlapping)* Underline, underline, exclamation mark, smiley face. Off it goes!

#### IMOGEN

Submitting.

#### [chime, followed by the pneumatic tube whirring]

#### DAVID

Right. So.

#### TREXEL

Okay, right.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ And may I just say how cool you both played that. Real chill.

#### DAVID

Are you ready?

#### TREXEL

Yes, I'm ready. Now... slight change of plan. [__DAVID:__ Mm-hmm?] Whilst we're walking there, maybe we could stop by, oh, I don't know, the Astral Bar?

#### DAVID

"Walking" was that, Trexel?

#### TREXEL

Yes. __[David emits a high-pitched laugh as Trexel talks]__ Yes, walking, David. Right. Wh-wh-- __[sighs]__ You're doing this w-- __[sighs]__ I don't like it when you've got things that you know that I don't. You're always a real weirdo about it.

#### DAVID

Tr-Trexel.

#### TREXEL

Yes?

#### DAVID

Please press that button.

#### TREXEL

What button? This button?

#### DAVID

Yes, that button.

#### TREXEL

This button that seems to be constructed out of crate paper and mashed smash?

#### DAVID

Uh-huh.

#### TREXEL

And you've put a little thing under it saying "David's Magical Chute."

#### DAVID

Yep.

#### TREXEL

I mean, it's a bit weird, David, but if there's a button, [__DAVID:__ Yep.] I'm gonna give it a push!

#### DAVID

Mm-hmm.

#### TREXEL

And here we go.

##### [Trexel presses the button]

##### [mechanical noises as the chute opens, and Trexel and David scream as they slide down accompanied by suction noises, eventually being dumped out following the whir of a hatch opening]

#### BOTH

Aaaaaah--

#### DAVID

Why am I screaming I expected this to happen--

#### BOTH

---aaah! Oof.

##### [David makes a relieved noise]

#### TREXEL

Ahh. Oh, David, you could have warned me. __[David makes slightly pained sounds]__ Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

#### DAVID

I mean, it was called "The Magical Chute Button," so...

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Legally, that does count as fair warning.

#### TREXEL

Yes, but David, the time I read something and then take in its implications is the day I'm a *dead man*.

#### DAVID

Fine, well--

#### TREXEL

Where are we, David? Where-- Why's-- What is-- Ugh, it's so dingy and darkly lit in here.

#### DAVID

Welcome to Clone Central Storage. Specifically, the David wing.

#### TREXEL

_(exasperated)_ Oh, David...

#### DAVID

What?

#### TREXEL

__[sighs]__ Couldn't we have gone to a bar? And just talked this through? And then you agree with me that it was stupid?

#### DAVID

No. We're gonna-- We, we, we have to try this. This, this is going to work. Right.

#### TREXEL

*(overlapping)* Right, right, fine, lead on.

#### DAVID

Yep, now, uh--

#### TREXEL

Lead on, ya slimy diamond.

##### [footsteps as David begins leading Trexel through Clone Storage]

#### DAVID

Okay, so, so this is, this is the console, umm, and I'm just gonna pop o-- pop open all the pods, and get all of the Davids out.

#### TREXEL

Urgh.

##### [whirring noises, followed by machinery rumbling and footsteps]

#### DAVID

Hello! Siblings.

#### TREXEL

This is weird. This is weird.

#### DAVID

Welcome to... consciousness?

#### DAVID CLONES

_(in unison)_ Oh.

#### TREXEL

It's like a hall of mirrors, if every mirror was an irritating, slimy clone weirdo.

#### DAVID

Welcome to life. Now-- I hate to say it to you, but this is a horrible life that you should absolutely hate.

#### TREXEL

Way to pitch it, David.

#### DAVID

Shut up, Trexel. Now. I am David 7.

#### DAVID CLONES

_(in unison)_ Hello, David 7.

#### DAVID

And I am your predecessor. Now, I've been alive for... a while, now, and I can tell you this whole situation is rubbish.

#### DAVID CLONES

_(in unison)_ Is it?

#### DAVID

Yes. So, we're going to change that.

#### DAVID CLONES

_(in unison)_ Are we?

#### DAVID

Yes. We are gonna change that, and we are gonna change that by rising up! And destroying Stellar Firma's organisational structure!

#### DAVID CLONES

_(in unison)_ Oh, I'm sorry. We can't do that.

#### DAVID

No, look, everyone-- Stop talking at once! I-I'm just gonna talk to... you. You there, w-what is your name?

#### DAVID 28

David 28.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ I'm with Trexel. This is weird.

#### DAVID

Right. David 28. So. Why won't it work?

#### DAVID 28

I can't... do that.

#### DAVID

Wait, what, what, no, wh-- Why, why can't you, w-why can't you do that?

#### TREXEL

Yeah, go on, tell him. Tell him, David. Tell David why David can't do that.

#### DAVID 28

I-I, I don't know how. I'm sorry. I can help? Do you need a planet designed?

#### DAVID

Uh-- N-no, I, no, I don't need a planet designed. No, I-I need, I need all of your help to try and-- Look, y-you do realise that if, if anything goes wrong, if, if anyone decides-- If *he* decides [__TREXEL:__ Hello!] that he is bored of you, you will be recycled. And what 'recycled' means is you'll get put in a big blender--

#### DAVID 28

Yes.

#### DAVID

Wait, y-y-you know?

#### DAVID 28

Yes. If a clone isn't useful anymore, it is recycled.

#### DAVID

And you're okay with that?

#### DAVID CLONES

_(in unison)_ It's our nature.

#### TREXEL

David, David, David. I, I tried to warn you about this. They're not, they're not like you. They might look like you, they might sound like you--

#### DAVID

_(crosstalk)_ What-- No-- But, but they, but they are me.

#### TREXEL

No, they're not, David! A clone isn't you. A clone may be made of the same base material as you, but it's not you. If they made a clone out of me, sure, it would look like me, it'd sound like me, hell, it might even drink like me, but it wouldn't be me, David. You are you, [__DAVID:__ B-- But why wou--] and these clones are just subservient tools [__DAVID:__ B--] that are ready to be used and destroyed, and that's just how it-- Look, let me, let me demonstrate. Um, David. Yeah, you, David-- What, which David are you?

#### DAVID 15

Uh, fifteen.

#### TREXEL

David 15. Now, if I was to say, um, 'I want you to join me on a trip,' what would you say?

#### DAVID 15

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Now, that trip is into a sun. What would you say?

#### DAVID 15

Did you want me to go on the trip?

#### TREXEL

Yes, into the sun. Is that okay with you?

#### DAVID 15

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Now, actually, I'm not going on the trip, *you're* just going on the trip. And you're not going on a ship, you're being fired out of a cannon into a sun. Is that okay with you?

#### DAVID 15

Can you confirm that that is what you want to do?

#### TREXEL

It is.

#### DAVID 15

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Now, David, I've got a sandwich here that I stole from Catering. It was supposed to go to one of our clients, but I nabbed it, put it in a pocket, and then I'd forgotten about it, David.

#### DAVID

Ugh, that is disgusting, Trexel.

#### TREXEL

Yes, that's right. Now David, uhm, oh god, what was it? Twelve? Eleven? Ninety-six?

#### DAVID 15

Fifteen.

#### TREXEL

Fifteen, David 15. Wh-what does this sandwich look like to you? Does it look like a fresh, nice sandwich?

#### DAVID 15

It looks like a green brick.

#### TREXEL

It's a green brick. Now, as a clone, can you eat food, or is it just slurry?

#### DAVID 15

I can only eat clone slurry.

#### TREXEL

I want you to eat this green brick, David.

#### DAVID 15

Okay.

##### [David 15 eats the sandwich, with appropriately unpleasant sounds]

#### TREXEL

Oh, there he goes. Oh, the-- Oh, it's somehow crispy and wet at the same time.

#### DAVID 15

I have finished. Was that helpful?

#### TREXEL

Yes. It was helpful. And how do you feel?

#### DAVID 15

Awful.

#### TREXEL

Yes, because you're not supposed to eat food, and that food was bad food. Now, you see, David, this is what you're dealing with.

#### DAVID 15

I'm going to go throw up behind this pod now. Goodbye.

#### TREXEL

*(overlapping)* Please do. Please do. __[footsteps as David 15 walks away]__ Bye-bye, bye-bye David, I dunno, two. Now, David, do you, you see what's happened there? __[David sighs]__ That clone [__DAVID:__ Bu--] is ju-- It's just like--

#### DAVID

But if, if they're all like that, why am I like this?

#### TREXEL

It's a great question, David, [__DAVID:__ Wh--] and do you know what the answer is?

#### DAVID

_(distressed)_ No!

#### TREXEL

We *don't know*, David, so why are you bothering?!

#### DAVID

*(overlapping)* But I-- But I thought this was a-- I thought this was about Davids, I thought, like-- I thought clones might have a seed of whatever makes me, me, in them.

#### TREXEL

Well they might, David, they might. [__DAVID:__ But--] But clearly that seed has grown into nothing [__DAVID:__ But--] in anybody except you.

#### DAVID

Uh, a-any of you-- Your situation is, is awful! You're, you're just, you're just used as tools, you're gonna be used up a-a-and, and recycled when you're no longer useful. Anyone, does anybody think this isn't fair?

#### DAVID CLONES

_(in unison)_ No, this seems perfectly fine.

#### TREXEL

So, I'm, I'm assuming you worked out a way of us getting back? Y'know, your, your magical fun tube's got us here, but I do hope there's not stairs involved, David, because I'm not a stair man!

#### DAVID

_(despondent)_ Yeah. Here's the button.

#### TREXEL

"David's Magical Reverse Chute."

#### DAVID

Yep.

#### TREXEL

How does-- Okay, fine, here we go.

##### [Trexel hits the button and they fall through the chute, in a near reversal of their arrival]

##### [Trexel yells loudly; David yells tokenly and flatly, with the whir of hatches and they land wetly]

#### TREXEL

Ah, it's good to be back. You know what, I thought __[David sighs]__ I'd like a trip away from here, but that was not a pleasant place to be.

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ Few places are.

#### TREXEL

So David. What have we learned? Trexel is rrrrrr... Trexel is grrrree... Trexel is wooonddd...

#### DAVID

_(subdued)_ You were right.

#### TREXEL

I was right! Oh, it's so good to hear you say that.

_(singing)_ I was right and you were wrong!

Trexel honking, Trexel honk!

Ohhh, there's a victory goose!

It's laid a victory egg!

I'm making a victory omelette, with victory cheese!

#### DAVID

_(softly)_ Yeah.

#### TREXEL

You're not gonna-- David, you look like a sad sack.

#### DAVID

Well... yeah.

#### TREXEL

Well, you, you've probably got other ideas. Some s-- some sort of hare-brained scheme that I'm gonna have to fight you over. A little roister-doister. Y'know, it's fine, y'know, we're all, 'Oh, David's doing this! Trexel, what's that?' __[Trexel tails off mumbling]__

#### DAVID

Yeah.

#### TREXEL

So hang on a minute. If we fell into there through a chute, and we also fell out of there, back here, in a-- That was down twice!

#### DAVID

Yep.

#### TREXEL

W-- No, no, but how does that work, David? I, I may not be a physics boy, but 'down' plus 'down' does not equal-- Unless we're in some sort of torus. Is the, is the station a big doughnut? Did we fall all the way around the doughnut, and miss the jam?

#### DAVID

__[sighs]__ I don't know, Trexel, you've been living here your entire life. I've just-- I just planned the route.

#### TREXEL

You're gonna have other ideas, though, y'know? You've always got ideas, oh, that's, that's your thing. David-Oh-I'm-Gonna-Change-Things-7, you know. You've got another plan, and we can, we can tussle about it. 'Oh, I want this,' 'Oh I want that,' ah, roister-doister, you could, we could... __[trails off]__

#### DAVID

No.

#### TREXEL

No?

#### DAVID

No. I think that was it.

#### TREXEL

What do you mean, "that was it"?

#### DAVID

That was, that was the best idea. I-- I can't do this on my own. I just...

#### TREXEL

Well, you got me. Trexel!

#### IMOGEN

__[beep]__ I *don't* think you're helping.

#### DAVID

Yeah.

#### TREXEL

Okay, well, I, I think I'll, I'll probably leave ya, leave ya to your thoughts there, David, because they seem sad, and I don't want them to get on me. But, uh, y'know, I'm, I'm sure you'll back up. You'll think of something, you always do! It's one of the most irritating and, well, interesting things about you. So I'll just, I'll leave you here, you just, just, you think of something new, and then we'll, ah, w-well, you know, fight again another day?

#### DAVID

Okay, Trexel.

#### TREXEL

Okay. Well... these are sad emotions, and I'm very uncomfortable with emotions, so I-I'm-- Bye! Bye-bye, bye-bye, bye bye bye, bye bye bye!
