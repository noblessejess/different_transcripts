__[Rusty Quill Gaming podcast theme]__

__Helen:__ Hello, and welcome to the Rusty Quill Gaming Podcast with me, Helen Gould, instead of Alexander Newall.

__[Lydia laughs]__

__Ben:__ He's dead!

__Helen: [laughs]__ We got rid of him in a coup.

__Lydia: [laughing]__ The king is dead!

__Helen: [chuckles]__ Long live me. __[Lydia laughs]__ So, I will not be your GM today because today we are playing a GM-less game.

__[Lydia cheers]__

__Helen:__ And I'm actually getting rid of, like, half the rules. __[scattered laughter]__ But with--

__Lydia:__ Anarchy wins!

__Helen:__ Yes! With me on this adventure, I have:

__Ben:__ Ben Meredith.

__Alex:__ I'm here and doing what I'm told apparently.

__Helen:__ Yes, you are.

__[Alex laughs]__

__Ben:__ What's-- what's your name?!

__Tim: (simult.)__ What's your name?

__Lydia: (simult.)__ Now tell us your name!

__Alex: (simult.)__ Alex! Newall! I'm sorry.

__[Helen laughs]__

__Lydia:__ Tell us it again!

__Alex:__ I'm sorry, I'm Alex Newall.

__Lydia:__ Yeah, good.

__Alex:__ Do what I'm told.

__Lydia:__ I'm Lydia Nicholas.

__Tim:__ And I'm Tim Meredith.

__Helen:__ Now, Tim, you are new to the gaming podcast.

__Alex:__ Stranger!__ [screeches like an attacking bird]__

__[Helen laughs]__

__Tim:__ I'm just a little baby boy.

__Lydia:__ Gosh, no! Are *you* editing it? 'Cause that is cruelty!

__[laughter]__

__Helen:__ Tim, please tell us about who you are and what you're doing here.

__Tim:__ Well first and, I suppose, chronologically foremost, I'm Ben's brother.

__Ben:__ Hello.

__Tim:__ Uh, that happened first.

__Alex:__ Boo!

__[Lydia and Helen laugh]__

__Tim:__ And we have together started another podcast on this delightful network of Rusty Quill, called--

__Ben: [amused]__ You've probably never heard of it.

__Tim:__ You've probably never heard of it. It probably hasn't come up in your feed or adverts or nothing.

__Alex: (simult.) [frustrated]__ *Mention its name!* I'm getting a *twitch!*

__Tim: (simult.)__ Mention-- well it's called-- uh, what's it called?

__Ben:__ Um...

__[snaps fingers trying to remember name]__

__Tim:__ Um, uh-- oh, um-- Stellar Firma is its name. Stellar Firma.

__[Lydia and Helen chuckle, Alex sighs]__

__Tim: [advert announcer voice]__ An improvised sci-fi comedy podcast. Available now.

__Alex:__ Better. I like it.

__Ben: [advert announcer voice]__ From podcasts apps around the internet!

__Tim: [advert announcer voice]__ Excuse me if I just crawl into your ear for one mere moment to tell you about Stellar Firma. __[Alex snorts] [dramatic inhaled, huskily]__ Hello.

__[laughter]__

__Tim:__ Okay, I'm done.

__[Alex bursts out laughing]__

__Helen:__ Okay, great. Got a hello there. That's all we need.

__[Lydia and Ben laugh]__

__Alex:__ Woah, Helen's relying on the editing hard here!

__Lydia:__ Yeah.

__Tim:__ At the end of every bit I'll just go, "I'm done."

__[laughter]__

__Tim:__ "But you *can't go in there!"* I'm done.

__Helen:__ Okay. All right. Is that everything that you wanted to say?

__Tim:__ I'm done.

__Helen:__ Okay! __[Lydia laughs]__ All right. So. What we are playing today is called Vast & Starlit and it is by Epidiah Ravachol. I apologise in advance if that is pronounced incorrectly. That is just-- that's my fault. So. How to explain it? We are escaped convicts. We have gotten off a prison ship and commandeered... a... weird-- I was going to say boat but I'm just going to say starship instead.

__[laughter]__

__Alex:__ Star boat.

__Ben:__ Space boat!

__Lydia: (simult.)__ Space boat.

__Tim: (simult.)__ Space boat.

__Alex:__ Oh, space boat's better.

__Helen:__ Yes. We have commandeered a space boat.

__[Tim chuckles]__

__Lydia: [laughing]__ Yeah!

__Alex:__ Yep.

__Helen:__ And are on our way to __[Tim and Lydia laugh quietly]__ freedom, essentially. Usually the story that is given in advance of this is that our prison ship encountered the strange space boat [__Tim: [deadpan]__ My god, a space boat.] and sent us on there in case it killed us. But like, just to investigate. And then the-- we either--

__Alex:__ Oh, like a *Suicide Squad* style kind of...

__Helen:__ Yes!

__Alex:__ Okay.

__Helen:__ So, we either hijack the space boat or it left without us doing anything, or it disappeared and now we're somewhere else. We can decide as we go along.

__Lydia: (simult.)__ Right, okay.

__Alex: (simult.)__ Okay.

__Helen:__ So, this is sort of less of a game and more of sort of a... series of improvised scenes which get more and more... tense.

__[Alex chuckles, Helen laughs]__

__Ben:__ So, welcome to the Rusty Quill Series of Improvised Scenes Podcast.

__Helen:__ Yes!

__Lydia:__ We're just gonna chill... in our space boat.

__Helen:__ Yes.

__Alex:__ But getting steadily more tense whilst we chill.

__Tim:__ Yeah.

__Lydia:__ Tension! Tension!

__[Alex, Lydia, and Tim start chanting 'tension']__

__[Tim imitates a train whistle]__

__Ben:__ Oh, I'm so tense now.

__Lydia: (simult.)__ Wooo! I am difficult.

__Helen: (simult.)__ Now, there are no dice in this system.

__[Ben chuckles]__

__Helen:__ There are no cards. There's not even like a coin to flip. Basically, we have to decide on how everything happens amongst ourselves. It's a narrative driven game that is the kind of game that I mostly play, 'cause I'm much more along the lines of a Grant Howitt gamer than an Alex Newall gamer.

__Alex:__ Rules are fun!

__Helen: (simult.)__ No they're not!

__Alex: (simult.)__ The game is... kind of beside the point.

__Helen:__ I'm hosting today! __[laughter]__ My way goes.

__Tim:__ No rules here.

__Lydia:__ Back in the hole!

__Helen:__ Now--

__Ben:__ Helen, I have to say that I'm very glad that our faction has taken over the podcast __[Helen laughs]__ and--

__Helen:__ It is a *better* way.

__Tim:__ I look forward to the terroring guillotinings of the sure-to-follow new regime.

__Alex: (simult.)__ Tim, join me and together we will *rule* with... *subsystems!*

__Ben: (simult.)__ Well, see, it's only Bryn and Alex. __[Tim chuckles]__ It's only Bryn and Alex and Bryn's not here, [__Lydia and Tim:__ Yeah.] so Alex is completely outnumbered.

__Tim:__ Trapped. Alone. Isolated.

__Helen:__ Yes, he is.

__Lydia:__ Now, I don't dislike rules--

__Tim:__ Traitor!

__Ben:__ Kill her.

__Lydia:__ --I just plow through them__ [Helen laughs]__ in naive--

__Ben:__ Oh, yeah, it's not that you don't like them, you just ignore them.

__Lydia:__ I just-- Yeah!

__Helen:__ I mean, I do tell a lie. There is some character creation before we get to the actual game play.

__Tim:__ A rule??

__Lydia:__ What?!

__Helen:__ I *know!* I'm terrible.

__[Lydia makes an upset banshee noise]__

__Alex:__ And so it begins!

__Helen:__ Now, we have got some rudimentary stuff to get through. So... Tim, can you briefly introduce your character first?

__Tim:__ My character's name is Deraldio Pilchards. A member of the hybunk race. They are described as "squat, square, and cross." And my crime that ended in my incarceration on this prison space boat is that I was digging trap pits for banditry reasons. __[Alex snorts]__

__Helen:__ Oh.

__Lydia:__ Oh, no.

__Tim:__ I was digging trap pits and they were like, "What are they for?" And I was like, "Uh, banditry reasons." __[laughter]__ And they... hauled me away.

__Alex:__ And then you said, "I'm done."

__Tim:__ And I'm done. __[Lydia laughs]__ I'm done.

__Helen:__ Alright. Lydia, what's your character's name, species, and crime?

__Lydia:__ My name is Mr. Squeakington, but I am female. The reason that there is this mix-up is that I'm a budgie and they're quite hard to tell apart. Budgie brackets "interdimensional." __[laughter]__

__Tim:__ Space budgie!

__Lydia: [laughing]__ And my crime... was smuggling budgies. __[Tim laughs]__

__Ben:__ Does it-- wait--

__Lydia:__ Budgies smuggling! __[laughs]__ Budgies are being--

__Ben:__ Is that-- Is that for you-- Is that people trafficking for you?

__Lydia:__ Yes! __[Tim laughs]__ People-- Budgies were being kept [__Alex:__ Dark. Dark.] against their will. [__Tim: [laughing]__ So much worse than I was--] I was sneaking the budgies to a better place.

__Ben:__ So, I backed off of war crimes but--

__Lydia:__ But I-- __[Helen laughs]__ No, I'm saving the budgies!

__Ben:__ Oh, but you were more of a-- Oh, okay.

__Lydia:__ Save the budgies.

__Tim:__ It was an Underground Railroad sort of situation.

__Ben:__ Yeah, okay.

__Lydia:__ Yeah! Underground but budgies and interdimensional.

__Helen:__ Okay. And just to clarify, you're a talking budgie?

__Lydia:__ I'm a talking budgie.

__Helen:__ Fantastic.

__Lydia:__ But when I get excited __[abruptly high-pitched]__ *I do squeak*!

__Helen:__ Lovely! That'll be great for the editors.

__Alex:__ What was your name again? Just for my notes.

__Lydia:__ Mr. Squeakington.

__Alex:__ Mr. Squeakington. Thank you.

__Tim:__ Brackets "Her/She".

__Lydia:__ Yeah.

__Helen:__ Yeah! Alex. Tell us about your character.

__Alex/Shmerr: [nasal monotone character voice]__ I'm Shmerr.

__Ben: [sighs]__ Oh, no, he's got-- __[Helen bursts out laughing, Lydia squeaks]__ he's got *that* voice out again!

__Helen:__ Oh, no! __[laughs]__

__Ben:__ Dangerous. Dangerous!

__Alex:__ Hot.

__Tim:__ The real Mr. Squee. __[chuckles]__

__Shmerr:__ I'm Shmerr. We are-- [__Lydia:__ Ah, squeak.] I am of the dissoliums and... we're-- we're very pro-administration.__ [soft groans]__ Although my crime was I did heist an ecosystem. It was interfering with processes, so. Just sort of got rid of that one.

__Helen:__ Lovely.

__Tim:__ Didn't realize we were doing these introductions in character. __[laughs]__

__Helen:__ We can do!

__Shmerr:__ I just find it easier to find the voice, you know?

__Tim:__ That's fair enough.

__[Helen laughs, Lydia squeaks]__

__Helen:__ Ben?

__Ben/Unal: [upper class military character voice]__ I am Commander Unal Manspray. __[Lydia laughs, then groans in realisation]__

__Helen: [strangled laugh]__ You actually did it.

__Lydia:__ You *actually went there!*

__Helen:__ Fantastic.

__Ben:__ Oh, this is an in-joke. So, to explain: Tim asked for some communal manspray [__Tim:__ Look--] because this room might be hot and stinky [__Tim:__ --when you're in--] so I wanted my name to be Communal Manspray.

__Alex: (simult.)__ His writer is *so* excessive!

__Ben: (simult.)__ Commander Unal Manspray.

__[Helen chuckles]__

__Tim:__ He's playing up because he's in company but he'll calm down.

__[Alex bursts out laughing]__

__Lydia:__ Yeah, it is-- __[laughs]__ That's exactly what we're all doing!

__Ben:__ I haven't calmed down in three and a half years, [__Tim:__ That's true. __[laughs]__] I'm not starting now.

__Alex:__ You guys are *much* younger than I thought.

__Tim:__ Yeah. __[Ben laughs]__ Yup, yup yup.

__Helen:__ Species?

__Unal:__ I'm a garblufian.

__Helen:__ Of course!

__Unal:__ Everyone knows what one of those is [__Lydia:__ Yeah yeah.] so we're moving swiftly on. __[Helen bursts out laughing]__ My crime was desertion. __[Lydia gasps]__

__Helen:__ Oooh.

__Alex:__ What dessert did you take? __[pause]__ Ba-dop-bop! I'm done. __[Helen chuckles]__ I'm done.

__Ben:__ He's done.

__Tim:__ He's done. __[laughs]__

__Alex:__ I'm done.

__Helen:__ Okay.

__Alex:__ We're done. __[laughs]__

__Helen:__ And because I am also playing-- [__Lydia:__ Yay!] I know! My name is Worshiper 2X7. My species is android, brackets "sentient", close brackets. [__Lydia:__ Mm-hmm.] My crime is desecrating the sacred ponds.

__Lydia: [bursts out laughing]__ Just the-- the idea that you must have been working with Commander Urinal for that. __[Helen laughs]__ No, it was Spray!

__Ben: (simult.)__ Unal Manspray!

__Tim: (simult.)__ It's *pronounced* Urinal-- __[laughs]__

__Helen:__ Right.

__Ben:__ How dare you.

__Helen:__ So. We've got the basics of our characters. The way that this character creation works is that we ask each other questions. These questions are leading questions that imply something about everyone else. So, for example, the example I gave before this is "how did you get that bizarre scar on your face?" A question I got before is "why did you abandon your son?" __[Lydia laughs, impressed]__ So, um,__ [laughs]__ it can range.

__Tim:__ So keeping it light and fluffy.

__[Alex and Lydia laugh]__

__Helen:__ Yeah! I mean, in that game we ended up finding my abandoned son on a different planet and I had to decide to abandon him again or whether to stay.

__[Lydia gasps]__

__Alex: [excited]__ Did you abandon him again?! Did you abandon him again?!

__Helen:__ I don't remember. __[Alex gives a disappointed sigh]__ I was in there for political reasons. I think he betrayed the cause. I can't remember exactly what happened.

__Alex:__ Ah, fair.

__Tim:__ Uh, get rid.

__Lydia:__ Ah, yeah, really. Doesn't care about this son. __[laughs]__

__Alex:__ Also, I'm liking that we're __[laughing]__ pro-abandonment here for some reason today.

__[Helen laughs]__

__Lydia:__ I-- I-- __[high-pitched ambivalent noises]__

__Ben:__ Pro-*double*-abandonment.

__Tim:__ Yeah.

__Alex:__ Double abandonment. I'm so sorry.

__Tim:__ Yeah, minus one son. Would abandon again.

__[giggling]__

__Helen:__ Okay. So, there is--everyone has to answer--there's a set of three mandatory questions but you only have to pick one. So, as long as one person answers one of the questions, it's fine.

__Alex:__ So, is that three between all of us? There are three or each person has three mandatory questions?

__Helen:__ Each person answers one of the three mandatory questions.

__Alex:__ Thank you.

__Helen:__ Okay. I'm gonna pick on you again, Tim, because you're the guest.

__Tim:__ I thought that.

__Alex:__ 'Cause you're strange and new.

__Lydia:__ And you must suffer.

__Tim/Pilchards: [dark, cockney character voice]__ I can explore my character a little more.

__Helen:__ Yeah, you can. So just--

__Ben: [laughing]__ What are you-- are you one of the Kray twins?

__[loud laughter]__

__Helen:__ Oh, please.

__Tim:__ I'm one of the Pilchards brothers, son.

__[laughter]__

__Ben:__ Are you a bandit? __[laughs]__

__Pilchards:__ Go on.

__[Lydia laughs]__

__Helen:__ Right. I am going to ask you one of the mandatory questions.

__Pilchards:__ Uh-huh.

__Helen:__ What do we lose by not listening to you?

__Pilchards:__ You lose a wealth of experience! I have killed people in many interesting ways, and I am willing to share my methods.

__[Ben snorts]__

__Helen:__ Good.

__Alex: [imitating Pilchards]__ You're also rapidly turning into Michael Caine.

__[Helen laughs]__

__Pilchards:__ I only wanted to kill one of them, but they've all died now.

__Alex: [laughing]__ Oh god!

__Helen:__ Lovely!

__Pilchards:__ What a shame.

__[Alex and Ben chuckle quietly]__

__Helen:__ The floor is now open to the other players to ask you any questions we can think of. Okay, what happened to your leg?

__Pilchards:__ Now, look. When you are running through the undergrowth, escaping the authorities, you have to look out for knotholes! 'Cause if you don't, you'll put your foot right in a little gindle or gully and it'll tear *right* off!

__Helen: [whispering]__ Good to know.

__Pilchards:__ Luckily, I have got four more so...

__Helen: [chuckles]__ Okay, so I would note down four legs.

__Pilchards:__ Mark the four legs. Well, no, five original. Well, you know what? Let's say six, 'cause who would evolve like that? And I've lost two so far. Leaving me with a square four.

__Helen:__ Good to know.

__Pilchards:__ Six to begin. __[laughs]__

__Ben:__ How would you describe your idiosyncratic fashion sense?

__[Lydia and Helen burst out laughing]__

__Pilchards:__ Style is... in the eye of the beholder. And unfortunately I spend a lot of time on my own.__ [Lydia laughs]__ So, I've cobbled together from the various people I have bandited, which is to say stolen from, a menagerie of different styles. And, yeah, I just put it on my body and whatever doesn't rot off, you know, kind of, kind of becomes what I'm going for. I'm done.

__Helen:__ Lovely.

__[Lydia and Helen laugh]__

__Helen:__ Yes, you are. __[laughing]__ Okay.

__Alex:__ What's the deal with all those machetes? It's the future.

__Pilchards:__ Nah mate, you don't need to know.

__Helen: [laughing]__ They're darn secretive.

__Pilchards:__ No, these, these are for my personal business, and if you want to find out, I'll show you, but you may not... exit.

__Helen:__ Wonderful. One more question.

__Lydia:__ How did you come by that unfortunate addiction?

__Ben:__ Oooooh!

__Alex:__ Good one. That's much better than mine. Taking notes.

__Pilchards:__ It's a lonely life, is banditry. You know, nobody to tell you, "Oi, that has rotted off in a way that makes it look unpleasant and not figure, not figure-forming or-or-or complementary to your square shape." __[Lydia bursts out laughing]__ And to fill the empty hours--

__Alex: [laughing]__ Forgot you were square.

__Pilchards: [Lydia and Helen laugh intermittently throughout]__ I'm square and squat and *cross*! And I fill the empty hours between various passers-by falling into one of my bandit pits. You know, you just push up your nose whatever you find, and it turns out what *I* found... were crystals. Dunno their street name! I call 'em "fun crystals." They make me feel tingly in my bits. Wait. Is that too hot?

__[laughter]__

__Alex:__ Hot! Hot!

__Ben:__ We didn't say which bits!

__Pilchards:__ Yeah. Fingers.

__Alex:__ Corners.

__Pilchards: [laughing]__ In my corners!

__[Lydia and Ben laugh]__

__Helen:__ To be fair, we should probably not make jokes about "hot" until I've explained what--

__Tim:__ Yeah.

__Lydia:__ No! We've established it.

__Ben:__ Oh, it's--

__Helen:__ Oh, we've established hot?

__Ben:__ We've been shouting "hot", "dangerous", and "difficult".

__Lydia:__ This is right from the beginning.

__Alex:__ Yeah, this is wibbly-wobbly, like, we're already ahead of time.

__Helen:__ This is extraordinarily wibbly. Okay.

__Tim:__ Yeah.

__Lydia:__ All right.

__Ben:__ I'd like-- __[Ben and Helen laugh]__ whatever your name is--

__Helen:__ What was your name again?

__Pilchards:__ Deraldio Pilchards.

__Alex: (simult.)__ Deraldio of the tingly corners. Pay attention

__Helen: (simult.)__ Okay, like Pilchards over here.

__Pilchards:__ I'm full of right angles and ready to mingle!

__[laughter]__

__Helen:__ Lovely. Lydia, what are you willing to do to be captain?

__Mr Squeakington: [high pitched squeaky character voice, random squeaks when talking]__ I'll gouge your eyes out. I've done it before! And I'll do it again! I've got little claws, so I take a while! They're small. See, in my dimension, we're bigger! But here we're too small! So I just have to scrabble around in your eye sockets! Eep!

__[Ben and Tim laugh]__

__Helen:__ Lovely. Monstrous budgie damage introduced. That's your one mandatory question. It's now open to the floor again.

__Tim:__ How do you feel about getting 'round with wings in an often-low-gravity environment?

__Mr Squeakington:__ Eep! Furious. __[Helen laughs]__ Like most things.

__[Ben chuckles]__

__Tim:__ Okay.

__Mr Squeakington:__ I've seen a lot of good budgies fly too high and then... escape orbit. Asteroids and things like that. Space budgies! Fly off! Never see 'em again. Eep!

__Helen:__ What happened to all of your friends?

__Mr Squeakington: [whimpers]__ Well we... we were-- we were trying to save as many as we could. As you can see, this is where we got... stranded in this dimension being all tiny and pet sized. People keep keeping us as pets. So, I was opening up a trans-dimensional portal system, and... something went wrong. Something went *weird*. __[quietly]__ Now my-- all my, all my friends... [__Helen:__ Oh.] [__Tim:__ Yeah.] sort of melted really.

__[Tim laughs loudly]__

__Helen:__ Oh, dear. Oh, dear! Melted, monstrous budgies.

__Alex:__ Tim's having a great time!

__Tim: [in a singsong voice]__ Melty budgies!

__[Helen laughs]__

__Mr Squeakington:__ But inwards.

__[Tim and Helen groan]__

__Ben:__ Ah, like an Easter egg in the microwave.

__Tim:__ Yeah.

__Helen:__ Oh, no!

__[Tim laughs]__

__Mr Squeakington:__ Yeah, that's what happened to all my friends. __[laughing]__ I prefer not to, to think about it really too much. Eep!

__Alex: [high-pitched incredulity]__ Why are you putting your Easter eggs in the microwave?! You're a *monster!*

__Ben:__ Get 'em hot, obviously.

__Tim: [Pilchards voice]__ You've got to take the foil off otherwise it creates quite the show.

__[laughter]__

__Ben:__ Um...

__Lydia:__ And you manage to assassinate... a bunch of your enemies. Just...

__Tim: [Pilchards voice]__ Pop it in the microwave, watch the sparks fly.

__Lydia:__ Turn the gas on and put an Easter egg in the microwave.

__Tim: [laughing]__ I misunderstood how to explode a house! 'Cause it's in a box. It's a sealed box.

__Helen:__ Oh, my gosh.

__Ben:__ You mentioned that, in this dimension, your species are kept as pets. What happened to your previous owner?

__Mr Squeakington: [viciously pleased]__ Eeeeehhhh! __[squeaky maniacal laughing]__

__Helen: [bursts out laughing]__ There's a look of glee.

__Tim:__ Listener, if you could only see the facial expressions.

__Mr Squeakington:__ Eh-hee-hee-hee. Eeeh! It was so awful that I described it in my language __[Ben laughs]__ so that none of you would be offended.

__Ben:__ Fair.

__Helen:__ Lovely.

__Alex:__ What's a... relaxing way for Mr. Squeakington to unwind after a long hard day?

__Mr Squeakington: [promptly]__ Dust bath.

__[Ben laughs]__

__Mr Squeakington:__ A dust bath. I peck my mirror a bit. And then, __[laughs]__ and then just like, flap around. It's great.

__[Ben gasping laughs]__

__Tim:__ Is-- is that a past time that is consistent across-- so even in your dimension where you're not pets, there's still, like, a big dust bath? And a *massive* mirror? Like a--

__Lydia: [laughing]__ Yeah.

__Ben:__ Yeah, they put the population of their planet as double what it is?

__Tim:__ Yeah, yeah.

__[laughter]__

__Tim:__ *So* many unopened Christmas cards.

__Alex:__ We'll get them one day.

__Mr Squeakington:__ You say that humans don't like mirrors?

__Tim:__ Oh, it's a damn good point.

__Ben:__ Ooh!

__Tim:__ Oh, think about that.

__Ben:__ I don't know. I'm not a-- I'm not a human. __[Tim laughs]__ And I never saw--

__Helen:__ We have *no* humans.

__Mr Squeakington:__ Ah, no. Eep!

__Ben:__ 'Cause they *suck*.

__Tim:__ They suck.

__Helen:__ Yeah.

__Mr Squeakington:__ Yeah. We like... pecking at mirrors? Chewing on plastic toys? Eep! __[Helen 'awws', Tim laughs]__ Mostly I'm angry 'cause I don't have any plastic toys to peck.

__Helen:__ Good to know for later plot reasons, I guess.

__Tim: [laughs]__ And thus a character arc was founded. __[laughter]__ The space quest for the plastic squeaky toy!

__Helen:__ Genuinely, this could end up that way. We don't know, because this is improvised.

__Mr Squeakington:__ Or murder.

__Tim:__ Or murder.

__Alex:__ Or *both*.

__Helen:__ Yeah, murdering for-- Yes! Yes, I could see-- okay. Alex.

__Mr Squeakington:__ Give me the mirror.

__[Tim and Helen laugh]__

__Helen:__ Alex, how would we be better off if you led?

__Shmerr:__ Well, the thing about me is that I can ensure that things run smoothly, and efficiently. And when you, when you want something to go in space, you can't be faffy. 'Cause if you are, ooh... trouble. __[Helen laughs]__ And also, I have, uh, the authoritative bearing... of a... born... leader.

__Helen: [pause]__ Yes.

__Tim: [quiet laugh]__ So much sweat in that voice.

__[Helen bursts out laughing]__

__Lydia:__ So clammy.

__Shmerr:__ If only there was some sort of communal manspray __[Tim and Helen laugh]__ for me to make use of but alas there is not.

__Ben:__ What happened to the rest of your terrorist cell?

__[Lydia gasps]__

__Shmerr:__ Oh, well, the thing is __[Tim laughs]__ that's actually a bit of an awkward question. __[Lydia and Helen laugh]__ They are actually still... fine. Once-- You know what they say, they say that, um, once you have-- "careful, actually, you do not... work yourself out of a jo--" I made it too efficient and they did not need me anymore. [__Helen:__ Aww.] So, now I'm here. But, I hear that they are taking the eastern quadrants by storm. I don't know why they called it the eastern quadrants. You can't use a compass in space but here we are.

__Helen: [chuckles]__ What did happen to all those glands?

__Shmerr:__ Did you mean mine or theirs?

__Helen:__ Oh. Yours.

__Shmerr:__ Mine. Well, the thing is, is actually it turns out that dissoliums, we, we have a bit of a problem when it comes to-- uh, as, as our good friend was right, at moisture that expands outwards from the body in a low gravity environment. It means we tend to be surrounded by a, a very moist and, uh, pungent cloud. Which, since I have become space faring, I felt it best to just have my glands removed because the controls were getting very slippy and people don't like a moist leader.

__[Lydia groans silently]__

__Helen:__ I think that's true.

__Lydia:__ See, I was going to ask "what are you doing about that horrible skin condition?" but I feel like you've already set up--

__[Ben laughs]__

__Helen:__ Yeah.

__Lydia: [groans]__ So foul.

__Helen:__ Okay. Two more weird leading questions for Alex's character.

__Tim:__ Do you always carry such a large satchel of paperwork with you?

__Shmerr:__ No, I-I've had to travel light since we've recently--

__Helen:__ In prison.

__[laughter]__

__Shmerr:__ I had to travel light in prison. I only had what I could smuggle in one of my seven orifices. But, thankfully, having done so, um, you know, I've just got the core, the real core things in here for me to make use of. I will, I will stock up at the first opportunity. Don't you worry. We will not run short of agenda or addendums. __[snorts]__

__[Helen laughs]__

__Lydia:__ What did you trade for that spectacular tattoo?

__Shmerr:__ Now, that tattoo does actually have quite the fun little story attached to it. It turned out that, uh, though they were very skilled at impromptu prison tattoos, especially on the face as you might notice, they were not too good at balancing their books and they were making quite the loss on ink, which they were having to make themselves out of, you know--

__Lydia:__ Their glands.

__Shmerr:__ Yeah, basically. So, uh, what, what I did is, in exchange for, for turning around their business model, they gave me this excellent looking phoenix. Now, I realize that, what with the slight facial sagging, it's not quite as robust__ [Lydia groans]__ as it should necessarily look. But I think that the sentiment is there.

__Lydia:__ Just a flop bird.

__Helen:__ Ugh!

__Shmerr:__ Well, you know. We will take flight, won't we? Eh?

__Mr Squeakington:__ I find that offensive.

__Shmerr:__ Alright.

__Helen:__ Oh, one dynamic already established.

__Shmerr:__ It's fine. We'll establish a human resources, uh, department which can arbitrate.

__Ben:__ A who resources?

__Tim:__ A what resources?

__Lydia:__ Yeah.

__Alex:__ A what?

__Helen:__ A personnel resources, maybe.

__Alex:__ Yeah, a hue-man. Like the, the, the thing that--

__Lydia:__ Who-man. The man but who.

__Alex:__ No, no, no, what you do is examine peoples' auras and then, based on their hues, you allocate them in a-- Keep up.

__Helen:__ Alright.

__[mouth trumpet noise, laughter]__

__Helen:__ Now--

__Shmerr:__ I'm done.

__Lydia:__ Whomp whomp.

__[Tim laughs]__

__Helen:__ Ben's character.

__Unal:__ Yes?

__Helen:__ The-- Urinal. __[laughs]__

__Tim:__ Oh, no.

__Unal:__ Did you think I wasn't going to be doing a voice?

__[Lydia laughs]__

__Alex:__ I just like that it becomes a competition with you and me every time.

__Ben:__ Sorely mistaken.

__Helen:__ What do we lose by not listening to you?

__Unal:__ Well, I have a long and storied military career, so that basically. None of the other-- none of you are fit to lead. You're all smugglers and criminals and murderers but I was in command of an entire legion! Hence the Commander bit.

__Helen:__ Right. Weird leading questions. Let's make some nasty. __[laughs]__

__Tim:__ Don't you think it's time to take off the uniform?

__Unal: [immediately]__ No.

__[laughter]__

__Unal:__ No, removing the uniform is admitting defeat. I was never defeated. I merely took a very tactical retreat which was misinterpreted by high command. __[pause]__ They were wrong.

__Helen:__ Where did your wife go?

__Unal:__ Oh, she left me.

__Helen:__ Ah. Where'd she go?

__Unal:__ Away.

__[laughter]__

__Helen:__ Fair. __[laughs]__

__Unal:__ I don't know. All I got was a note when I came back from tour. "I'm leaving you. You're boring. You're married to the army. Love, Your Wife."

__[laughter]__

__Tim:__ That was more of a request.

__Alex:__ That was-- that was a request--

__Tim:__ "Love your wife." I'm going.

__Unal:__ No, she didn't name herself which was really the final insult.

__[Tim and Alex laugh]__

__Lydia:__ Why did you miss out on that promotion?

__Unal:__ Well, they didn't agree with some of my more... interesting and *bold* ideas. We have mounted infantry. Well, how about dismounted infantry? Crawling along the ground, underneath the bushes. No one sees them coming! But they said I was mad, a fool. Well, we'll see who's a mad fool now!

__Lydia:__ Is it you?

__[Tim and Helen laugh]__

__Unal:__ Signs point to yes. __[laughter]__ But I must say I'm in a bit of a nadir of my life right now, so.

__Alex:__ What actually did happen at the Pink Commode club?

__Unal:__ Yes. One of the darker chapters in my career, of course, except for my court marshal and subsequent imprisonment. The Pink Commode was a vice of mine in which, um-- well, it's in the name, really. We all sit in a big ring on pink toilets and, um... do the business together.

__Alex: [quietly laughing]__ Oh, I regret my question.

__Unal:__ Well, you did ask.

__Tim:__ Like a-- like a rugby tour. I understand.

__[laughter]__

__Ben:__ No, there was no flinging.

__Tim:__ Oh, I understand.

__[Lydia groans]__

__Helen:__ Of course. Alright, so, Ben can you ask me one of those three questions?

__Ben:__ I can. What do we lose by not listening to you?

__Worshiper 2X7: [robotic character voice]__ The absolute rationality of an android.

__[Lydia laughs]__

__Helen:__ This is gonna be hard 'cause I'm not a rational person.

__[Ben and Tim laugh]__

__Lydia:__ Neither is anyone that describes themselves as rational.

__Helen:__ Okay, I put "rational?".

__[Lydia laughs]__

__Alex:__ What is... love?

__Worshiper 2X7:__ It is a chemical aberration that we will try to stamp out.

__Ben:__ Who's we?

__Tim:__ Oh!

__Worshiper 2X7:__ The other Worshipers who also desecrated the pond.

__Tim:__ What was it that so offended you about this particular pond that you decided to desecrate it?

__Worshiper 2X7:__ The meaning of religion is not in the ground but in the sky.

__[chuckles]__

__Lydia:__ I see.

__Tim:__ Noted.

__[Ben laughs]__

__Lydia:__ What happened that time your power banks ran out?

__Worshiper 2X7:__ I do not like to speak of this but it involved... a lot... of blood!

__Lydia:__ Okay. Um, I won't ask "yours or someone else" but, well, that's a follow up question and I don't know if those are allowed.

__Helen:__ They are not allowed.

__Lydia:__ Squeak et cetera.

__Tim:__ Squeak-- __[laughs]__ Squeak et anon anon.

__Ben:__ What were the circumstances which led to your creation?

__Worshiper 2X7:__ The ancient manuscripts say that all of the Worshipers were created in order to serve the Almighty Cloud Cycle, which is why __[Ben gasping laughter]__ we have separated from the main sect. We will ascend to the heavens to join the great Cumulus!

__Ben:__ This is your-- Is your religion GCSE geography?! __[laughter]__ And you've got the precipitation cycle.

__Tim:__ The water cycle.

__Ben:__ So the sacred pond doesn't have sacred things in it. It's actually *the pond* that's sacred.

__Helen:__ It was created by, like, a bored geography teacher.

__[laughter]__

__Tim:__ Like, that scrap of paper from a GCSE classroom in Barnstaple fell through a time hole and it appeared in their dimension. They were like, "it is God! God has spoken to us! God--"

__Mr Squeakington:__ We do not talk about the GCSE class in Barnstaple! Eep!

__Tim:__ "God has a baseball cap and sunglasses on the cover for some reason."

__Helen:__ Okay.

__Worshiper 2X7:__ For this reason, I worship moisture.

__Ben:__ Oh-oh, no.

__Helen: [evil laugh]__ I know!

__Ben:__ A dynamic has been created.

__[Helen and Lydia laugh]__

__Alex:__ If only you had no glands.

__Ben:__ Actually, this is a very dry-- you like dust baths Lydia.

__Mr Squeakington:__ Flap flap.

__Ben:__ You have no sweat glands.

__Shmerr:__ I sacrificed them.

__Ben:__ So, um--

__Pilchards:__ I've got a very dry sense of humor, I'll have you know. __[Helen and Lydia laugh]__ Very droll.

__Helen:__ God, I can't stop thinking of you as a Kray twin. Right, that's all of our characters introduced so we're gonna take a break there.

__Lydia: [laughs]__ Hot!

__Helen:__ Hot!

__Alex:__ Dangerous!

__[pause for break]__

__Helen:__ So, next up, we are going to describe the ship that we have *stolen?* --or which has run away with us, away from the prison ship.

__Unal:__ Which has come into our possession.

__Helen:__ Yes.

__Pilchards:__ We happened to find a ship and it is now the ship we are on.

__Helen:__ Yes. That one. So, we're gonna answer this collectively. So, not entirely... leading questions this time. So, the first question is "how is our ship unique?"

__Shmerr:__ There's only one of it. That's normally the first, the first requirement for something being unique.

__Helen: [sighs]__ Ah, you're so--

__Lydia: [whispers]__ Why?

__Ben:__ I-- It flies in a vertical manner. So, it's not-- I know there's no, like--

__Alex:__ You're talking Boba Fett style?

__Ben:__ Yeah! Yeah, it's like-- it's a very *tall* ship, not a very *long* ship.

__Helen:__ Okay.

__Tim:__ Is it like a--

__Lydia:__ Which allows it for quite the precipitation cycle.

__Ben:__ Yes.

__Helen:__ Ooh!

__Tim:__ Yeah.

__Lydia:__ It's powered-- it's got a small rainforest in the center.

__Helen:__ Okay. Tall and vertical ship with rainforest.

__Tim:__ Which also means that it's much like a lighthouse, very tight staircases [__Alex:__ Yeah.] but lots of levels.

__Ben:__ Yes.

__Alex:__ See, unfortunately, we pretty much have to entirely rely on the single lift system, I mean, these days, so...

__Tim:__ And you know what--

__Mr Squeakington:__ Speak for yourself! Squeak!

__[Helen and Tim chuckle]__

__Lydia:__ Yeah, maybe there's just one tall tree in the middle and all the staircases go around it.

__Alex:__ But it's really unnecessarily tall. Like, *improbably* tall.

__Lydia:__ It's unnaturally tall. It is somehow also the engine.

__[Alex laughs]__

__Ben:__ Oh, yes.

__Helen:__ What's the engine?

__Tim:__ The Gaia Drive.

__Lydia:__ The tree.

__Alex:__ Gaia Drive, yes!

__Helen:__ Ooh!

__Lydia:__ Yes!

__Tim:__ "Gaia Drive" TM, TM, TM. [™™™]

__Helen:__ Okay.

__Shmerr:__ I don't like it. It's extremely hard to quantify.

__Ben:__ Oh yes, your-- your name is Tim.

__[Helen and Tim groan, mouth trumpet noise]__

__Helen:__ Okay, next one.

__Ben:__ No! No, I was the __[mouth trumpet noise]__'d against! __[laughter]__ How the __[mouth trumpet noise]__ has turned!

__Alex:__ The __[mouth trumpet noise]__ has become the __[mouth trumpet noise]__.

__Helen:__ How is the ship quirky or temperamental?

__Tim:__ I think it was under repairs when we stole it. Maybe that's the circumstances under which we were allowed to get access to it.

__Shmerr:__ And it doesn't like us.

__Ben:__ Yeah, the tree--

__Shmerr:__ It just actively doesn't like us!

__Ben:__ The tree is sentient.

__Tim:__ Yeah, yeah. It's a sentient tree ship.

__Helen:__ That's fantastic.

__Lydia and Ben: (simult.)__ And it doesn't like Alex.

__Tim:__ It knows it's taken.

__Ben:__ Yes!

__Shmerr:__ Now, it doesn't like all of us, I'm fairly--

__Ben:__ No, it doesn't like Alex.

__Lydia:__ It doesn't like Alex.

__Tim:__ We all get on with it.

__Shmerr:__ The name is Shmerr.

__Ben:__ Sorry, it doesn't like Shmerr.

__[Lydia and Tim laugh]__

__Shmerr:__ No, I-- no, no, I was speaking to Gaia and Gaia assured me that all of you are, are problematic, I'm sure, and that it is not just me.

__Tim:__ Yeah, I don't buy it. You don't like Schmee.

__Shmerr:__ The doors don't open for me.

__[laughter]__

__Helen:__ You have to wait there until one of us comes along.

__Shmerr:__ I have to wait 'til other people enter a room and then follow behind.

__Tim:__ It shuts *really* quickly.

__Shmerr:__ And I have to do it really quickly, yes.

__Ben:__ Sometimes the door, like, opens just a lil' bit--

__Shmerr:__ Those are a trap.

__Ben:__ --and then it traps shut.

__Shmerr:__ Those are a trap, I've-- Fool me once...

__Helen:__ Right.

__Tim:__ And it just projects a really cool party on the other side. __[laughter]__ "Whoop, look what's through here. Not for you!"

__Helen:__ What does the ship lack that we need?

__Ben:__ Oh, uh, moisture?

__Lydia:__ Oh.

__Helen:__ Is the rainforest dying?

__Ben:__ Yeah. Yes.

__Lydia:__ No! __[makes upset high-pitched noises]__

__Tim:__ It was under repairs because it was a dry tree!

__Ben:__ Yeah.

__Helen:__ Yes!

__Alex:__ The Gaia Drive needs water.

__Tim:__ Yeah.

__Ben:__ Wait, so you mean our ship is... real thirsty. __[laughter]__ Hot.

__Alex:__ Hot. By the way, this is an-- __(simult.)__ this is an in-joke that we're going to explain eventually. But I'm--

__Helen: (simult.)__ We are going to explain the "hot" thing.

__Ben:__ Well, it's an-- it's an in-joke that will become an out-joke.

__Lydia:__ Yeah.

__Alex:__ This is a time travelling in-joke. I love it.

__[Helen and Tim laugh]__

__Helen:__ Okay. Needs water--

__Lydia:__ Listen to the episode... backwards.

__[Ben and Tim laugh]__

__Helen:__ Please don't do that. __[Lydia makes noises imitating the episode being played backwards]__ Yeah, that's what it will sound like. Okay. There's also a section for answering questions individually about how we interact with the ship.

__Shmerr:__ I think, um, mine's fairly... fairly established by everyone.

__Lydia:__ Yeah. Pretty clear.

__Helen:__ No, there are two mandatory questions. [__Alex:__ Oh.] You don't get to improv that bit.

__Alex:__ Oh! Oh!

__[snickers]__

__Alex:__ Schooled!

__Tim:__ All of a sudden there's more rules than we thought there might be.

__Shmerr:__ I love it.

__Ben:__ Helen.

__Tim:__ Helen.

__[Helen laughing hysterically]__

__Shmerr:__ It's everything I wanted it to be.

__Tim:__ Helen.

__[Lydia yelps]__

__Tim:__ Lydia has fallen over.

__Shmerr:__ Lydia looked far too sideways and fell off the chair.

__Lydia:__ Lydia tried to be accusatory and fell down.

__[Tim laughs]__

__Helen:__ The side-eye is too strong.

__[Lydia laughs]__

__Helen:__ Okay.

__Tim:__ "I can accuse you from the floor."

__[Lydia laughs]__

__Helen:__ Now, the two questions are: how is the vessel home? And where do you find sanctuary in it?

__Lydia:__ I've got a nest.

__Helen:__ Is that a way you find sanctuary?

__Lydia:__ In a tree. Yeah.

__Helen:__ Okay. And how is it home for you?

__Lydia:__ It's a nest.

__[laughter]__

__Helen:__ That makes sense.

__Alex:__ I mean, you know what? I'm fine with that as an answer. I think that's very logical.

__Lydia:__ I put little-- I put lots of bright things in it.

__Alex:__ Ah, there you go.

__Helen:__ Aww.

__Lydia:__ In the nest.

__Mr Squeakington:__ Which I stole! Eep!

__[Helen laughs]__

__Pilchards:__ I found sanctuary in the very bottom of the ship because it is, in many ways, like the pits I used to dig. All the way down in the bottom. Sometimes things fall out of peoples' pockets and blonk, blonk, blonk down the stairs they go, right to daddy! __[laughter]__ All mine!

__Alex:__ Daddy Deraldio.

__Helen:__ Someone's gonna sample that. "It is gonna go right to daddy!"

__Pilchards:__ It all-- it all collects in my pit.

__[Helen laughs, Lydia groans]__

__Lydia: (simult.)__ You're basically a trapdoor--

__Alex: (simult.)__ Your decidedly dry pit. We have established this.

__Pilchards:__ It's not-- It's, it's been very well water tanked. Ain't gonna get no seepage from the ground outside. Wait, we're in space. Nah, it's fine.

__Lydia:__ I mean, are you essentially a trapdoor spider?

__Pilchards:__ This has been said. __[laughter]__ I do occasionally put dry leaves over the top of my hole and *dart out* at small moving animals. And, uh, is it-- what's the other question?

__Helen:__ The two questions are: how is the vessel home and how do you find sanctuary in it?

__Pilchards:__ Well, that-- yeah, it's home 'cause it's in my pit. We've already established that. __[Helen laughs]__ And I've found sanctuary in my mind palace.

__Helen:__ Good. Lovely.

__Pilchards: (simult.)__ Wherever-- wherever I am is my, is my sanctuary.

__Lydia: (simult.)__ Covering a head with leaves.

__Helen:__ Okay. [__Lydia: [softly]__ Multiple leaves.] Okay, I'll go next. For me--

__Worshiper 2X7:__ The vessel is home because it is the first thing I have owned... in my... not life. Existence.

__Alex:__ Version.

__Lydia:__ And how do you find sanctuary? Squeak et cetera.

__Worshiper 2X7:__ I hang out... near the leaves of the tree. That's as close as I can get to the sky. Technically we are in the sky 'cause we're in space but... you know what I mean.

__Lydia:__ More sky within the sky. A sky all the way down.

__Ben:__ Well, given it's its own atmosphere--

__Lydia:__ Maybe clouds.

__Tim:__ Where are the clouds?

__Ben:__ Yeah, perhaps when you, you know, when we get water in it, clouds will form. So--

__Worshiper 2X7:__ Yes. I'm establishing my base early.

__Ben:__ Yep.

__Worshiper 2X7: (simult.)__ To take advantage of the moisture!

__Tim: (simult.)__ This is where clouds might be.

__Helen:__ Yes. The sacred moisture.

__[laughter]__

__Ben:__ Hot.

__Alex:__ Dangerous! Dangerous!

__Lydia:__ Oh my god! Very difficult!

__Helen:__ Commander Urinal.

__Tim: [laughs]__ Commander--

__Unal: [offended]__ Unal! Manspray! __[laughter]__ Commander Unal Manspray.

__Helen:__ How is the vessel home to you?

__Unal:__ I've forged a home here. One would say something so organic and disorganised would not be a home to me. But I found a place in the center of the trunk where I've laid out my things, pressed my uniform, created an office... Yes.

__Helen:__ Lovely. And where do you find sanctuary in it?

__Unal:__ There.

__Helen:__ Oh, okay.

__Unal:__ But I find sanc-- No, I find sanctuary in it because this is a start of something *new*. A unit. A group! The start of a new military. A new army.

__Helen:__ Oh, no.

__Lydia:__ Oh, dear.

__Pilchards:__ I doubt I agree with this.

__Unal:__ Forging their own way *in this crazy, mixed-up universe*.

__Shmerr:__ Sounds like you need logistics, my friend.

__Helen:__ Oh, boy.

__Tim:__ I sense-- I sense a battlement forming.

__[Alex laughs]__

__Lydia:__ A *dynamic* has been established.

__Helen:__ How are we--

__Alex:__ I feel like we're in, like, uh, *Walking Dead* or something. "He will remember that."

__[Helen and Tim laugh]__

__Helen:__ I love saying that in real life. Um, so, how is the vessel home for you, Shmerr?

__Shmerr:__ Well, um, the, the-- well, it's not *really* a home but I have found that if I just put on a suit and hang around on the outside, Gaia can't, you know, mess with me that much. __[more of Ben's gasping laughter]__ So, my, my home, I suppose, is the, the quiet of waiting outside with my magboots on.

__Tim:__ So, it's important to remember he's an outside Shmerr.

__[laughter]__

__Shmerr:__ I mean, not by choice but, you know, we roll with the punches.

__Helen:__ And where do you find sanctuary in it?

__Shmerr:__ Well, I-I find it as a sanctuary, you know, because I'm a fixer, you know? People like me because what I do is I-I fix problems. [__Lydia: [snorts]__ I apologize for that noise.] And this, this enormous tree based system is a problem which I will fix and everyone will love me for it, including, ironically, the tree but I don't think that the Gaia Drive knows that yet, but Gaia Drive will like me.

__Helen:__ Lovely.

__Lydia:__ Great.

__Helen:__ Okay. The next direction is to draw the ship but, because this is primarily an audio format, we'll be skipping that.

__Alex:__ I drew a tree and then put a... line around it.

__Tim:__ Tube. A tube.

__Ben:__ How about-- how 'bout we just... if the audience wants to draw the ship...

__Helen: (simult.)__ Yeah! And then tweet us the pictures.

__Tim: (simult.)__ Draw the ship. Send it to us.

__Ben:__ Yea.

__Helen:__ Yes.

__Ben:__ Yea.

__Alex:__ Ah, Lydia's already basically done. Just make sure to put me on the outside clinging on.

__Ben:__ Alright, cancel that. No one else draw the ship. Uh, we'll post up Lydia's drawing and that is that. That's it. That's canon.

__Alex:__ Currently I'm the only one so the ship is mine apparently.

__Tim: [quieter]__ Hey guys, draw a ship and send it to me privately @tctmeredith.

__Alex:__ And then blend the streams and have Jonny the Archivist in it [__Tim:__ Yeah.] chilling out with Trexel.

__Tim:__ Oh!

__Alex:__ Anyway--

__Helen:__ Wouldn't it be like the isolation-- Anyway...

__[laughter]__

__Lydia:__ I made a tree. __[puts pencil down]__ Done.

__Helen:__ Lovely. Thank you very much.

__Lydia:__ You're on the outside. He's a spider. And I've got a nest.

__[Tim laughs]__

__Alex:__ Everyone--

__Ben:__ So, where am I?

__Alex:__ Golf clap. __[polite golf clapping]__

__Helen:__ Oh.

__Lydia:__ Inside.

__Helen:__ Very, very lovely.

__Lydia:__ With a hat on.

__Unal:__ Very good, yes. A regimental hat.

__Helen:__ So, to explain--

__Lydia:__ And the android is plugged in.

__Helen:__ The ship's plugged in?

__Lydia:__ Well, you see, you need power.

__Helen:__ The tree is plugged in?

__Ben:__ We never asked! Can we ask you an extra question?

__Lydia:__ Yeah, I wanna know how you're powered.

__Helen:__ Me?

__Ben:__ Yeah!

__Helen:__ Yeah.

__Ben:__ What's your power source?

__Lydia:__ Yeah.

__Helen: [laughs]__ Um... Ooh! I know.

__Worshiper 2X7:__ My power source is also moisture.

__Ben and Lydia:__ Ah!

__Worshiper 2X7:__ So we have a limited amount of time before I power down. __(simult.)__ And lose all of my protocols.

__Lydia: (simult.)__ Oh, no. Last time there was a power down there was a lot of blood.

__Tim:__ Yeah, apparently.

__[Alex laughs]__

__Worshiper 2X7:__ Operate on default settings.

__Lydia:__ Oh, dear.

__Ben:__ Wait. Wait, the-the blood was... the place... ah.

__Lydia:__ Default: blood.

__Alex:__ Default: murder. Kill. Exsanguinate. Murder. Kill. Exsanguinate.

__Tim: [imitates robot voice]__ Low on power. Must find water. Nearest water: blood in person. Kill person. Suck blood.

__Helen:__ Basic-- I'm a vampire robot!! __[cheers]__ The coolest being!

__Lydia:__ Mind blown! Mind blown!

__Tim:__ And you're blown?

__Helen:__ Everything alright over there?

__Lydia:__ Mind. Mind blown, not mine blown.

__Tim:__ Oh, I see. Mine! Blown!

__Helen:__ Right. So, the way that this is actually gonna work is essentially it's going to be a series of improvised scenes. Taking turns, each of us is going to set up the scene. We're gonna say where the scene is taking place, who is there, and explain what's happening. So, for example, I might say, "we're down in the pit and the budgie has gone to discuss where the nearest water source is with Pilchards." And then they just sort of discuss it amongst [__Tim:__ Sure.] themselves and we laugh. Now... __[laughs]__

__Tim:__ Such fun we will have. __[documentary narrator voice]__ Listener, please, won't you come along with us on this *hi*-larious journey.

__Alex:__ Hot.

__Tim:__ Hot.

__Helen:__ Okay. __(simult.)__ So, thank you for that segue.

__Lydia: (simult.)__ You do need to explain-- __[laughs]__

__Alex:__ I'm helping apparently.

__Lydia:__ Dangerous!

__Helen:__ So, do we-- are we, are we going to use this rule or not?

__Lydia:__ Yes!

__Ben: (simult.)__ I think we *have* to use the "hot" rule now.

__Alex: (simult.)__ I mean, we *really* have to now.

__Helen:__ I think we have to use it now. Okay. So, if at any point a scene between the characters becomes difficult, dangerous, or hot--

__Alex:__ Hot!

__[Lydia laughs]__

__Tim:__ Hot.

__Helen:__ --anyone has to shout out one of those adjectives. So, for example, if someone is going to try and climb the entire tree, we'll say--

__Alex:__ Hot!

__Helen:__ --difficult.

__Alex:__ Oh, yes. That one.

__Helen:__ Difficult is what we will say, Alexander.

__Alex:__ But if someone was gonna be climbed *like* a tree...

__Helen:__ It would be hot.

__Alex:__ Hot! Right.

__Tim:__ And dangerous.

__[laughter]__

__Helen:__ Um, dangerous might be if you're trying to open the airlock, for example.

__Shmerr:__ Just come inside.

__Helen:__ Hot!

__Ben:__ Yeah. I'm going through it.

__[laughter, Lydia groans loudly]__

__Helen:__ And that's how it's gonna work. As soon as this--

__Lydia:__ Sorry, that's, just-- that was the tension coming out.

__[Tim and Helen laugh]__

__Tim:__ Wound like a coiled spring. Pwang!

__Lydia:__ Wang!

__Helen:__ As soon as dangerous, difficult, or hot is uttered, the scene ends because that is a cliffhanger. And the next time you come back to a scene with one of the characters involved, we have to decide how that situation was resolved.

__Alex:__ Okay.

__Helen:__ If the thing is dangerous, then it probably involves someone getting hurt or endangered. If it is difficult, then you have to probably get something that was needed before it can be done successfully. If it's both, then you failed and endangered everyone. So, difficult and dangerous would be opening an airlock that was stuck.

__Lydia:__ On fire.

__Helen:__ Yes! That too.

__Alex:__ And full of spiders.

__Tim:__ Full of s--

__Helen:__ All of those, difficult and dangerous. [__Alex:__ Hot.] You will not be able to do it but, you know, we will decide an interesting way--

__Lydia:__ What happens if we-- what happens-- how do we resolve hot scenes? Do we not show that? Is that censored?

__Tim:__ Yeah.

__Alex:__ You-- No, what you do is you suddenly cut to a bunch of, like, 1950s stock footage __[Lydia starts singing the opening notes of "Let's Get It On" by Marvin Gaye]__ of people, like, hosing down streets, fireworks going off--

__Tim:__ A train going into a tunnel.

__Alex:__ A train entering a tunnel. Tim gets it.

__Tim:__ Just oil derricks [*sic*] going up and down. No, I understand. I've watched 1950s filth.

__[Alex laughs]__

__Helen:__ Huh. Right.

__Tim:__ Dwell on it! __[Helen and Tim laugh]__ Shaking fist!

__Helen:__ There is also an extra section about meeting other alien species but we're gonna skip that for time. So, if we do meet other aliens, we're just going to decide what they're like.

__Lydia:__ We're just gonna rop it and drop it.

__Helen:__ We're just gonna roll with it.

__Ben:__ We're just gonna rock it.

__Lydia:__ Roll, roll, roll with them rocking it.

__Helen:__ Okay. And that's--

__Lydia:__ Rocking this--

__[Helen and Tim laugh]__

__Tim:__ No, no. Keep going. It's getting better.

__[Lydia laughs, mouth trumpet noise]__

__Tim: [laughing]__ Just do a trumpet. __[mouth trumpet noise]__

__Alex:__ My h--

__Ben:__ There's just a really small elephant on the table.

__[Tim laughs]__

__Helen:__ How are you making-- Okay. So, just as a reminder, can everyone go around and say their names? I am Worshiper 2X7.

__Pilchards:__ Uh, my name is Deraldio Pilchards.

__Helen:__ Mm-hmm.

__Mr Squeakington:__ Mr. Squeakington.

__Shmerr:__ Shmerr.

__Unal:__ Commander Unal Manspray.

__[Mr Squeakington squeaks]__

__Helen:__ Okay.

__Pilchards:__ It, it does sound like urinal, doesn't it?

__Lydia:__ Yeah.

__Unal:__ No! It's Unal!

__Pilchards:__ Alright, Urinal.

__Unal:__ It is a great name.

__Helen:__ Does anyone have any ideas for the opening scene, or shall I come up with one?

__Tim:__ I think, yeah, you start.

__Lydia:__ Yeah, you start. You're in charge.

__Helen:__ I should start.

__Alex:__ We'll respect your authori-tah.

__Tim:__ Autho--

__Helen:__ Aw.

__Ben:__ Wow... Not only is it a *South Park* reference but it's a *South Park* reference from *twenty years ago*!

__Lydia: (simult.)__ It's a deep cut.

__Alex: (simult.)__ I'm topical.

__Lydia:__ It's a deep cut.

__Helen:__ Okay. In which case, I would like Unal, can you try and recruit Pilchards to your army?

__Tim:__ Where is, where is this taking place?

__Helen:__ Ooh, in your pit, I think.

__Tim:__ In my pit.

__Unal:__ Pilchards, come out of that damn hole.

__Pilchards: [voice echoing from being in his pit]__ This is my safe place. If you wanna talk to me, you can come on downstairs.

__Unal:__ That's a dirty great pit.

__Pilchards:__ It's a lovely pit.

__[Lydia laughs]__

__Unal:__ So, okay, it's a dirty, great, lovely pit.

__Pilchards:__ It's a lovely, dirty pit and if you want to talk to me,* you will descend*, sir.

__Unal:__ Oh, fine, I will. How do you get down? Is there a rope or something?

__Pilchards:__ Just lift up the leaves and dry grass that I've placed over the lid.

__[leaves moving]__

__Unal:__ Okay. That's very well camouflaged. I'm glad I didn't step in that.

__Pilchards:__ Yeah.

__[Lydia laughs]__

__Unal: [voice now echoing too]__ Right. So I'll just-- Okay.

__Pilchards:__ Just sit down. Just take a seat. If you've got anything in your pockets-- nah, actually, I'll find out. Don't tell me. __[pause, laughter]__ How can I help you, Ural? What do you want?

__Unal:__ Well, Pilchards, I've been thinking. Now that we are out of the clutches of the corrupt law, we should create some sort of, uh, force of our own. Strike out into the, the great dark beyond. Uh, you seem to be, uh, an individual with a love of machetes. [__Pilchards:__ Mm.] Um, you certainly have a lot of them. [__Pilchards:__ Yeah.] And I was thinking you might be, um, useful as a-a-an infantry man. Have you ever been in the army, Pilchards?

__Pilchards:__ Yeah, an army of sorts. If by army you mean I kill people in a forest.

__Unal:__ Well, yes, if the army is doing arboreal maneuvers, we may need to, um, see action in a forest, so that would work very well.

__Pilchards:__ Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna stop you there, Ural. Don't you remember me, Ural? No?

__Unal:__ No, it's, it's Unal and, uh, no, I can't say I--

__Pilchards:__ No?

__Unal:__ No, I've nev-- No.

__Pilchards:__ No? Now remember, uh-- now, was that four, five years ago? Your squadron was doing maneuvers in the outer belt. Thought you'd come onto a little planet of mine, didn't ya? Oh, oh, let's stop the bandit activity, you said.

__Unal:__ Oh, yes! Those horrible, dirty bandits.

__Pilchards:__ Yeah, that would--

__Unal:__ They dug a lot of holes every-- I see! I see what's happened here.

__Pilchards:__ Yeah, traditionally two and two do make four, don't it?

__[Lydia chuckles]__

__Unal:__ Yes.

__Pilchards:__ Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so why don't you pop up those lil' stairs into your lil' trunky office with your military histories--

__Unal:__ Okay.

__Pilchards:__ --yeah, and your lil' books, and you lil' regimental soldiers. I've heard you playin' with them. I've heard you playin'. Oh, oh look at you, remembering the past. It's dead. The past is dead, Urinal. The past is dead!

__Unal:__ It's Unal.

__[laughter]__

__Pilchards:__ And if you don't keep out-- If you don't keep out of my way, cakey boy, then you are gonna get it.

__Unal:__ Okay, well, uh, so that's a no to the army then?

__Pilchards:__ It's a hard pass, Urinal Cakes.

__Unal:__ Alright, well, well just-just-just think about it.

__Pilchards:__ Yeah.

__Unal:__ Uh, maybe when we're in some sort of dire straits and you need somebody with a tactical brilliance of, of Commander Unal Manspray, you'll think of me.

__Pilchards:__ Yeah, I'm more of a lone wolf spider if I, if I'm honest.

__Unal:__ Okay. Well I'll just climb out of this horrible, dirty pit you live in.

__Pilchards:__ Yeah. Yeah, you do that. And--

__Unal:__ I am doing that. I'm doing that right now.

__Pilchards:__ Thanks for the mints, by the way.

__Unal:__ Oi! What? My--

__Pilchards:__ Num num num num.

__Unal:__ My mints!

__[laughter]__

__Helen:__ And cut!

__Tim:__ Num num num. __[laughs]__

__Ben:__ And that is how Pilchards eats. Num num num.

__Tim:__ Oh look, some food. Num num.

__Helen:__ I should mention as well. If, like, if a scene ends that's not dangerous, difficult, or hot, someone can just say cut.

__Tim:__ Yeah.

__Lydia:__ Yeah, it was--

__Helen:__ That was very good. Thank you very much. That was exactly what I wanted.

__[Tim and Helen laugh]__

__Ben:__ It's almost like we do an improv podcast together.

__Pilchards:__ You've gotta do it--

__Helen:__ Yes! It's almost like I strategically picked.

__Lydia:__ It's like you might know each other from some... past...

__Ben:__ Nah, no.

__Lydia:__ ...experience. Maybe some shared... experience.

__Pilchards:__ A conflict dynamic's alright if you get on with the person in real life.

__[Lydia and Helen chuckle]__

__Helen:__ Right.

__Lydia:__ If.

__Ben:__ If. Big, big if.

__[Lydia chuckles]__

__Helen:__ Now, so obviously this is a turn-based thing so Tim, now you can choose the characters you want, the location, and what's happening.

__Tim:__ Right. Um, in which case, this next scene will take place right at the, uh, the top of the ship where, uh--

__[SFX: bird noises]__

__Helen:__ Worshiper 2X7.

__Tim:__ --Worshiper 2X7 is deeply contemplating the world outside the porthole. And I think Mr, Mr. Squeakington--

__Mr Squeakington:__ Eep!

__Tim:__ --has fluttered up to converse.

__Mr Squeakington:__ Eep!

__Helen:__ About what?

__Tim:__ About... oh, that's a good question, buddy. __[laughs]__

__Helen:__ Maybe about moisture. __[laughs]__

__Lydia:__ Yeah.

__Tim:__ Yeah, yeah. Yeah, maybe about her obsession--

__Helen:__ Getting the water for the drive-- __[laughs]__

__Tim:__ Yeah, yeah, the overall, the overall mission. What are we, what are we going for here?

__Mr Squeakington: [squeaks]__

__Worshiper 2X7:__ Yes.

__Mr Squeakington:__ We're... out of fuel. Eep!

__Worshiper 2X7:__ I am aware.

__Mr Squeakington:__ What are you gonna do about it?

__Worshiper 2X7:__ I am looking __[Mr Squeakington squeaks]__ out of the-- Do not interrupt me!

__Mr Squeakington: [squeaks]__ I'm just so angry! Eep!

__Worshiper 2X7:__ I understand the feeling.

__Mr Squeakington:__ Eep!

__Worshiper 2X7:__ I am looking out of the porthole to see if there are any other planets in sight.

__Mr Squeakington:__ Ah, an asteroid? Made of water?

__Worshiper 2X7:__ I don't think those exist.

__Mr Squeakington:__ All-- most asteroids are made of water. That is what they're made of.

__Worshiper 2X7:__ Are they not made of rocks?

__Mr Squeakington:__ No. The comets, rather I meant. Comets are made of water, yeah. They've got a water trail.

__Ben:__ They're ice.

__Helen:__ Oh! __[laughs]__

__Tim:__ Yeah, they're ice.

__Ben: (simult.)__ So, water is ice, sorry.

__Alex: (simult.)__ So, an asteroid is an asteroid that's made of rock and a comet is an asteroid that's made of ice. Them's, them's the breaks.

__Worshiper 2X7:__ Well, you should have clarified. __[laughs]__

__Mr Squeakington:__ To be fair, I am a budgie.

__[laughter]__

__Mr Squeakington:__ An interdimensional one but still, it's a lot of knowledge to fit in *a very tiny head*. As I've explained to you before, we got shrunk in the interdimensional transfer and I've lost a lot of ideas.

__[laughter]__

__Worshiper 2X7:__ Of course.

__Mr Squeakington:__ Now my memory is just end.

__Worshiper 2X7:__ That is alright. I have lots of memory.

__Mr Squeakington:__ Oh, good.

__Worshiper 2X7:__ So, we are looking for a comet.

__Mr Squeakington:__ Yeah. __[stutters]__ Should we just look out the window for one? Or are there any more technological options?

__Worshiper 2X7:__ Maybe there is a scanner somewhere.

__Mr Squeakington:__ Squeak! Sounds like a mission. Squeak.

__Worshiper 2X7:__ Would you like to accompany me down the trunk?

__Lydia:__ Flaps furiously. __[squeaks]__

__[SFX: bird flaps, ends]__

__[Helen laughs]__

__Helen:__ Okay, so we're going down the trunk.

__Lydia:__ Yeah.

__Ben:__ Cut?

__Helen:__ I think cut.

__Alex:__ I think that's a cut.

__Helen:__ Yes. Oh--

__Alex:__ I feel like if it's difficult to literally move around it might get *real old* real quick.

__[laughter]__

__Helen:__ Okay. We've got Pilchards and Unal have had a falling out.

__Ben:__ Yes.

__Helen:__ Worshiper 2X7 and the Budgie are on a mission down the trunk to find--

__Lydia:__ Eep, eep!

__Helen: [laughs]__ Yeah! To find technological solutions.

__Shmerr: [scat sings]__ Out here on my own.

__Helen:__ Lydia.

__Lydia:__ Yeah.

__Helen:__ What is the next scene that you would like to see?

__Lydia:__ I'd like to see Commander Unal trying to recruit the android.

__[laughter]__

__Tim: [sings]__ Always on your own!

__[Shmerr sighs]__

__Ben:__ You're gonna have to give yourself a scene.

__Shmerr:__ Now it's, it's fine. In a lot of ways, this is everything that I expected. __[laughter]__ In a lot of-- You know, in some ways, our fate is what we make for ourselves. So, I've made for myself a small dent on the left port vent.

__Tim:__ Can we make this airlock more soundproof?

__[laughter]__

__Ben:__ Just whispering through the cracks!

__[laughter]__

__Helen:__ You know you've got cracks in the airlocks. What's that?

__Shmerr: [static noise]__ Guys, turn on the radio, please. __[static noise]__ It's so cold. __[static noise]__

__Ben:__ Was it Schmee Eiffel?

__[Alex laughs]__

__Helen:__ Okay. Where's the location? Do you want to be with--

__Lydia:__ Oh. Uhhh--

__Helen:__ --me when he approaches me?

__Ben:__ Yeah, I could be bumping into you looking for a--

__Lydia:__ Oh yeah! Yeah, we could bump into, as we're going down the trunk.

__Alex:__ Well, you've gotta go down the middle of the trunk in order to get to the bottom.

__[SFX: forest sound of crickets and bugs]__

__Tim:__ Yeah.

__Lydia:__ Yeah, there's a spiral staircase, I assume, around the trunk.

__Tim:__ Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

__Helen:__ Okay.

__Lydia:__ Not that that matters to me. Flappin', flappin' violently.

__Helen:__ Okay.

__Lydia:__ I do everything violently.

__Helen:__ So, it's a scene with the three of us.

__Lydia:__ Yeah. Eep!

__Helen:__ Okay.

__Unal:__ Ah! Worshiper! And, uh, Mr. Squeakington! [__Mr Squeakington:__ Eep.] Very good to see you both. Um, I have a proposal for you, Worshiper particularly. But also you, Mr. Squeakington, if you, if you wish to join up. I was thinking, and I've raised this idea with Pilchards down below and, and, yeah I think he seems... maybe trepidatiously interested. __[Lydia snorts]__ Well, I was thinking that, now we have a new lease of, of freedom, away from galactic injustice. You see?

__Mr Squeakington:__ Eep?

__Unal: (simult.)__ Justice not been justice--

__Worshiper 2X7: (simult.)__ Yes, and towards the moisture.

__Unal:__ Yes, very-- yes. Moisture everywhere. So, I was thinking--

__Mr Squeakington:__ Really? Where? 'Cause we're quite short.

__Unal:__ Well, exactly. So, I was thinking that we need some sort of organizational structure in order to, to best logistically organize ourselves, uh, to finding some water. So, I was thinking, maybe we-we have some sort of unit and we could--

__Worshiper 2X7:__ And I could be the leader.

__Mr Squeakington:__ Eep! I'm the leader.

__Unal:__ Well--

__Worshiper 2X7:__ No.

__Mr Squeakington:__ I was the leader of my cell of Underground Railroad budgies.

__Unal:__ Well, I am a commander, obviously. It's in the name. *Commander* Unal Manspray.

__Worshiper 2X7:__ I am the most logical. I have the least flesh.

__Unal:__ Ah. Well, actually, um, you'll find-- in, in--

__Worshiper 2X7:__ I think you have a lot of flesh.

__Mr Squeakington:__ Yeah.

__Unal:__ I do. I am a-a biological organism, as is tradition--

__Worshiper 2X7:__ Deficient. Deficient.

__[Tim laughs]__

__Unal:__ Okay. Uh... right.

__Worshiper 2X7:__ I am the best choice.

__Unal:__ Well... well... Well, we did have a logistics officer who was very rational. Very, very good at, uh, knowing where to go next. But you need somebody with more of a, a personable outlook to be, sort of at the top of the pile.

__Worshiper 2X7:__ I am extremely likeable.

__Unal:__ Are you?

__[Tim laughs, Lydia squeaks]__

__Worshiper 2X7:__ Everybody loves Worshiper 2X7.

__Unal:__ Well, well then, what a good idea. We'll have to put it to a vote. We should have some sort of crew meeting in our new... new world order.

__Mr Squeakington:__ It's much more urgent that we find fuel or we're all gonna--eep--die.

__Unal:__ Well, exactly. But if we're all pulling in opposite directions, we don't move anywhere at all. So, I was thinking that we have a meeting to set up a-an organizational structure and we can then pull in the same direction with our own ranks and hats.

__[laughter]__

__Worshiper 2X7:__ I do not recognize hats.

__Mr Squeakington:__ Yep.

__Unal:__ Well, they're, um, small items of clothing that you put on top of your head like the one that I'm wearing now. That's a--

__Worshiper 2X7:__ I do not recognize their authority.

__Unal:__ Uh, well they're not-- the hat isn't actually the authority, it's more of a symbol of, of authority.

__Mr Squeakington:__ I don't recognize symbols.

__Unal:__ Well, cymbals tend to go on drum kits. They're large disks of metal.

__[laughter]__

__Alex:__ Cut it, please.

__Tim:__ Wow, it's a self-assurance rock meets a confidence hard place and nobody-- __[laughter]__ tremendous work.

__Helen:__ Okay. Right, well--

__Lydia:__ Yeah, but this is difficult.

__[laughter]__

__Helen:__ Well, it depends on what you're-- if you're trying to arrange a crew meeting.

__Ben:__ Yes.

__Shmerr:__ If only one of you would accept a very eager helper. __[laughter]__ You'd have that one lil' advan'age but no. __[scat sings, Tim joins in]__

__Ben:__ Yeah, do-- we could--

__Lydia:__ A face drifts past a porthole.

__[Helen laughs]__

__Tim:__ Just pointing at itself. "A-ha. Why not?"

__Helen:__ Okay, so we'll cut that there. I guess you'll find out next week if the... crew meeting actually happens.

__Tim:__ Oh, such stakes.

__Lydia:__ Or if we run out of fuel. Before--

__Alex:__ We're gonna run out of fuel and die in space doing nothing!

__Lydia:__ Before the android goes on a bloodthirsty rage.

__Ben:__ And anyone talks to Shmerr.

__[laughter]__

__Tim:__ To be fair, to be fair, in like, in real time, in like real time stuff, like maybe eight minutes has happened. So, I think we can, I think we can have a crew meeting.

__Alex:__ All is lost.

__Ben:__ Oh, you don't know how long the ship is.

__Lydia:__ Yeah.

__Tim:__ That's true.

__Ben:__ It's very long.

__Tim:__ Could be two days from tip to tail.

__[laughter]__

__Alex:__ We're done.

__Tim: [laughing]__ We're done.

__Lydia:__ I'm a very small budgie.

__Helen:__ Yes, we are all now done.

#### EVERYONE

Bye!

__Helen:__ My species is android brackets sentient close, a blose-close brackets. Oh, gosh. Please edit that bit out so I don't sound like I'm completely tripping over my *entire* mouth. Um...

__Lydia: (simult.)__ You need to do another version.

__Tim: (simult.)__ You need to say a clean take. You can't just edit it out.

__Ben: (simult.)__ Yeah, you can't--

__Helen:__ Okay. Really--

__[laughter]__

__Lydia:__ Just edit-- Could you just edit all of my words.

__Ben:__ Just work around it.

__Tim:__ My species is... and my crime...

__Alex:__ Lowri, just--

__Ben:__ Yeah, Lowri it's just like, "my species is... __[different voice]__ android."

__[laughter]__

__Alex:__ So, Lowri, what I'd really like you to do is take what we have here, and could you just edit it into something entirely different.

__Tim:__ Yeah.

__Lydia:__ Yeah.

__Alex:__ Maybe a, a reading of Tolstoy. __[laughter]__ I mean, maybe a BBC 16-part drama.

__Helen:__ I don't know how it works! It may as well be magic to me!

__Tim:__ Just cut out the syllables.

__[laughter]__
